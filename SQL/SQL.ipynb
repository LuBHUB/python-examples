    "# SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL** (**S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage) is a language for interacting with [relational databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database). As with so many things, there is a Python library that allows us to execute SQL commands from Python. In fact there are a few such libraries, but we will focus here on one of the simplest, `sqlite3`, which interfaces with a popular variant of SQL called 'SQLite'.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate just a few of the basics of SQL. To learn more, see the following links:\n",
    "\n",
    "* SQLite main [documentation page](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)\n",
    "* a great SQL [tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp)\n",

    "## Relational databases\n",
    "\n",
    "We are familiar with the idea of storing data in tables, whose rows represent units of observation (such as a person, a point in time, a measurement, a company, etc.) and whose columns represent variables, i.e. pieces of information for each of the units of observation (such as age, Reaction Time, symptom severity, turnover, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important features of a relational database is that it can (and almost almost always does) consist of more than one such table, where the tables are in some way related to one another. This model for representing data has some advantages over single tables. To get an idea of why, let's look at an example of a single table of data stored in a csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file stores the names of songs in a small database of music. There are columns for the artist and album, along with some other information about each."

    "One thing that is immediately apparent is that the file duplicates a lot of information. Each row is a single song, so song is our 'lowest level' unit of observation. But many of the songs come from the same album, and some of the albums are by the same artist. To represent this fact in a single table, we have to repeat artist and album information on every row, even if that same information is already present in the table elsewhere. Note also that we have no easy way of asserting that these repetitions of artist and album names really do refer to the same entity, and not for example to two different albums that happen to have the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not necessarily a bad way of organizing data. If our set of data is small and we do not care too much about being able to store it efficiently and access it quickly, then a single table is often fine. However, for very big databases that we need to access really fast, for example on a busy web server, this model is inefficient. It is also prone to error should we mistakenly insert the same data twice or forget to take repetitions into account when counting artists or albums.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where a relational database comes in. It allows us to store data with multiple units of observation, without repeating information about each unit. In the example above, our multiple units of observation are songs, albums, and artists, so we could have a table for each. This sort of a database conforms to one of the [first basic principles of efficient data storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_normal_form): don't repeat information about the same unit of observation. As long as we take care to link the tables appropriately, the full set of information relevant to one or more observations can be joined together if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading from a database\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now take a look at an example SQLite database that stores the same information as the csv table above. To get an easier, interactive overview of the contents of the database file, you can first view it using a graphical browser for SQLite databases. [Here](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) is a good one. (Be sure to close the database in the browser before trying to interact with it in Python, or you may not be able to access the file, or may access a temporary copy of it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in Python is to open the database file. Then we insert a 'cursor' into the file. This cursor acts as our agent in the file, and we can instruct it to read (or write) data."
