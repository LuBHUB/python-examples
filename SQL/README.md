# Examples for SQL

[reading.sql] and [writing.sql] are example SQL scripts written for SQLite, with example statements for reading and writing, respectively.

[SQL_examples.sh] is a bash script that runs both examples using the appropriate .db files and with the echo on. Running this script results in a printout of all the example statements, followed by their results where applicable.

[SQL.ipynb] demonstrates the use of SQL statements from within Python, using the `sqlite3` library.
