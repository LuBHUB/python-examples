    "Most of the basic operations that our Python programs carry out are executed so quickly as to seem instantaneous. But because of the way that computers work, and because of the way that Python itself is designed, some basic operations take longer to execute in Python than do others. All else being equal, if we have the choice between two or more methods of accomplishing the same task, we would prefer the method that runs the fastest. Here we will look at a few techniques that can help us make our programs faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before doing so, it is important to note that all else is rarely equal. For many purposes it is much more important for our programs to be flexible, quick to write and to modify, and above all clear for others to read, than for them to be fast. We should avoid wasting time trying to make our program run a few milliseconds faster if this difference is not crucial.\n",

    "* our program runs on a server and is queried by squillions of users per second\n",
