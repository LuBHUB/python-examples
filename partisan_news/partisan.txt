Glen Campbell’s family released that he was in his final stages of Alzheimer’s and we were all extremely heartbroken to hear the news. When we found out that Glen Campbell was in his final stages of Alzheimer’s we weren’t sure what to expect the next couple of months. Unfortunately, this meant that Glen Campbell had lost all ability to speak or play guitar and it was just a matter of time before we had to say goodbye forever.  Campbell family has handled the situation very gracefully and they have been as strong as they possibly can be while they watch him wither away. His wife has become an advocate for Alzheimer’s and his children are also very involved. Glen Campbell made an exceptional impact on country music, and it has been absolutely heartbreaking to see him this way. Although he isn’t able to attend any shows, the country music world has surrounded him with love from afar.  Recently at the ACM Honors, four special country men took the stage to honor Glen Campbell and all that he has done for country music. Dierks Bentley, Blake Shelton, Toby Keith and Keith Urban gave one of the greatest tributes of all time and Glen Campbell’s daughter spoke to PEOPLE about the honor that it was. “The Academy of Country Music reached out to us a while ago and we were completely thrilled…I hope people see how his music and his voice really touched people and is still touching people now. It’s the definition of timeless.”  Her father is now 80-years-old and he is being cared for at a full-time care facility near their home in Nashville, Tennessee. Ashley says that her father’s disease is definitely progressing but that lately he has stayed pretty steady with little to no change. She went on to say that sometimes he will see her and light up with a smile, and he’ll hug her. Of course, with the disease progressing you never know what to expect when you walk in the doors where he is. “He’s definitely progressing but he’s been pretty steady lately…There’s no giant leaps and bounds, but for the most part he is just in his own world. When I go and visit him, he might notice I’m there and his face will light up and he’ll give me a hug.”  And although his attention span is really short right now, Ashley says that he finds joy in being around others which is a huge blessing for her and her family at this point in the disease. “(He’s) just very happy and content and a joy for everyone to be around…That’s all you can ask for at that stage.”  We are heartbroken to hear about Glen, but happy that he still loves to be around his family! Please say a prayer for him in the comments below!!
Hollywood legend Clint Eastwood endorsed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump while also expressing his lack of excitement for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. He is after all a well known Hollywood conservative which is hard to come by.   The actor said Donald Trump is, “on to something because secretly everybody’s getting tired of political correctness, kissing up. That’s the kiss-ass generation we’re in right now. We’re really in a p***y generation. Everybody’s walking on eggshells. We see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff.” He went on, “When I grew up, those things weren’t called racist,” he continued. “And then when I did ‘Gran Torino’ even my associate said, ‘This is a really good script, but it’s politically incorrect.’ And I said, ‘Good. Let me read it tonight.’ The next morning, I came in and I threw it on his desk and I said, ‘We’re starting this immediately.’” Well tell us how you really feel Clint! It appears that perhaps, if even in the least bit, that Clint Eastwood and Donald Trump have something in common. They certainly have no filter. Eastwood did say in his statement that he believes Donald Trump occasionally steps out of line. Specifically Trump’s comments about a Mexican judge being unfit to do his job because Trump made derogatory comments about Mexican’s and he felt the judge would be prejudiced as a result. But he brushes it off as saying that Trump is simply stating what is on his mind. The icon himself gave some advice for the future that he thinks could potentially make a difference, “I’d say get to work and start being more understanding of everybody—instead of calling everybody names, start being more understanding. But get in there and get it done. Kick ass and take names. And this may be my dad talking, but don’t spend what you don’t have. That’s why we’re in the position we are in right now. That’s why people are saying, ‘Why should I work? I’ll get something for nothing, maybe.’” He has made headlines over some of his comments about the Republican nominee. When people called Donald Trump racist he proclaimed that people just needed to get over it already. He made sure to add a curse word in their for effect. One of his biggest criticisms of Hillary Clinton is her willingness to remain in the status quo which he detests. Which honestly is not entirely inaccurate. Eastwood’s political sentiments are contrasted by the majority of Hollywood. Hollywood is known for being made up predominantly of progressive liberals. You cannot find an actor who is unwilling to use their status, power, fame and money to advance their liberal agenda and causes. Eastwood is one of the few A list celebrities who is conservative. Most others are barely known and don’t do tell well after expressing their conservative sentiments. Just look at Mel Gibson and Stacey Dash. It is always nice to hear an A lister speak their conservative opinions. Because they are one of the Hollywood elite. Thus, they cannot be scoffed at as easily and dismissed. Certainly not the man, the myth, the legend, Clint Eastwood. 
From the Daily Caller News Foundation: A shooter opened fire at the Cascade Mall on Friday night, killing five people and fleeing the scene of the crime. Dozens of police officers are currently searching for the gunman, described as a Hispanic man in his 20s or 30s. Authorities believe the man acted alone, though it’s possible that he received help, a spokesperson for the patrol, Sgt. Mark Francis, said in a midnight briefing outside the mall. “I’d be extremely diligent and careful if you come in contact with the suspect,” Francis warned. “Stay indoors, stay secure.” The shooter killed four women in the cosmetics department of a Macy’s department store at the Burlington shopping center, which is located 65 miles north of Seattle. Another man suffered critical injuries but passed away Saturday morning, Sgt. Francis said on Twitter. The gunman, armed with a long hunting rifle, left before police arrived. The mall was quickly evacuated around 8pm, minutes after the shooting took place. There has been no indication that the event was terror-related, Washington State Trooper spokeswoman Heather Axtman told NBC News, adding that the motive remains unclear. “We’re still trying to gather as many witnesses as we can to get more information,” she said. Eric Mathews, 40, intended to meet his teenage son Kai at the mall on Friday night, arriving just as the shooting occurred. The two left before the mall was locked down, but four of Kai’s friends were stuck inside. “Imagine I was late or if he didn’t answer his phone,” Mathews told the NY Times, referring to his son. “That stuff is running through my mind.” Tari Caswell was in the Macy’s women’s dressing room when she heard the shots, “like four balloons popping,” she told the Skagit Valley Herald. “Then I heard seven or eight more, and I just stayed quiet in the dressing room because it just didn’t feel right. And it got very quiet,” she added. The investigation is ongoing, and the FBI has said early Saturday morning that it had “no information to suggest that additional attacks,” were planned in Washington state. This is the second attack at a U.S. shopping mall in less than a week. Last Saturday an assailant stabbed nine people at a mall in St. Cloud, Minn. before an off-duty police officer intervened.

This is just getting pathetic. A restaurant owner in Florida took exception to Hillary’s “basket of deplorables” remark. So on his sign outside, he made a statement: NRA Member… Concealed Carry OK… Not a Deplorable… Vote Trump. This enraged Hillary Clinton supporters who began to mobilize to protest the restaurant. You would think that would actually be a threat since she has 57 offices in the state of Florida and Trump has six. You would be wrong. The owner of the restaurant, Bill Davis, called Trump supporters and they decided to counter the Clinton mob even though they had a 24-hour head start. It wasn’t even a contest. 16 Clinton supporters showed… over 100 Trump supporters made them look weak to say the least. Florida is a must-win state for Clinton. Looks to me as if she is in serious trouble there.  From Top Right News: A restaurant owner in Florida decided to post a sign in favor of Trump, Hillary Clinton’s local office immediately rallied supporters to protest on Facebook. But when they got there, the Democrats found themselves outnumbered — more than 5-to-1 — by Trump fans. Bill Davis, owner of the seafood restaurant Barnicle Bill’s in Sarasota, was upset with Hillary’s description of Trump supporters as “a basket of deplorables.” So he decided to post a sign supporting the GOP nominee:  The sign reads: NRA MEMBER CONCEALED CARRY OK NOT A DEPLORABLE VOTE TRUMP The first debate is tonight and my money is on Trump walking away with it. Clinton is terrible in a debate and the Trump persona will literally overshadow and dwarf the Hildabeast on stage. Trump is leading Clinton in Florida… shows of support like this must terrify Hillary and that is sure to be uppermost in her mind when she scales that stage tonight. Clinton has outspent Trump 5 to 1 and is still losing. And although the polls still show her with a minor edge on winning the election, that is bound to change at this rate. The worm is turning and in the final stretch, Trump could leave her in the political dust of history. If Trump walks away in the debate tonight, Clinton will be all but finished. If she has a potty attack, a seizure, a brain freeze, a stroke or a fainting spell… well, Trump can start picking out drapes for the White House. Trump’s followers have enthusiasm and passion for their candidate. Hillary can’t even get a soul to show up to go door to door for her. Her crowds have been underwhelming to say the least. Barring the rigging of the election, it looks like Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States.   
Eric Trump has had enough of Hillary Clinton, as we all are, but the difference is, he’s doing something about it by speaking out and making his voice heard. Erichas been one of the most vocal of the Trump family, outside of Donald of course, when it comes to the lying shrew known as Hillary Clinton. Thi,s weekend he called in to Judge Jeanine Pirro’s show and absolutely DESTROYED her on the topic of being fit to lead. Listen below and cheer along with me and he dismantles every lie Hillary has ever said, exposing the worst nightmare for Hillary voters – the cold, hard truth. “Hard-working Americans feel totally left behind by Washington, D.C.,” Eric Trump said on Justice. “We lost one-third of all our manufacturing jobs. I find it ironic that Hillary spends her life in Los Angeles or the Hamptons [N.Y.]…doing fundraisers” while the elder Trump holds public rallies that draw more the “15 thousand people,” he said. Trump said his father has been preparing for some time, but “not by memorizing cue cards”. He “speaks with very intelligent people,” he said. He also said Clinton is the definition of someone “unfit” to be commander-in-chief. “Unfit is deleting emails and lying to the Department of Justice and lying to Congress. Unfit is running one of the largest Ponzi schemes in American charitable history,” Trump said.  Absolutely RIGHT! Unfit is lying to the American people about your every move, your health, and your privacy when it comes to your political life. If you can’t be transparent, you dont’ deserve to be in government at all. Do you agree with Trump’s words? SHARE this with everyone you know. Keep getting the word out there that we will not bow down to ANOTHER Clinton, especially her. (Source: Fox News) 
This election will ask us to choose one of the following: an overqualified, dignified woman, or a fascist, xenophobic billionaire. The woman, Hillary Clinton, has dedicated her life to fighting for the rights and dignities of all, while the man, Donald Trump, has fought only for himself and his pockets. One group that tends to vote Democrat â but has been leaning a little more towards the right recently â are Jewish people. In 2008, 78 percent of Jewish Americans voted for President Obama, as did 74 percent in 2012. This year is different. Instead of facing off against John McCain or Mitt Romney, the Democrats are facing off against the definition of fascism and xenophobia. And they have a message to their grandchildren: vote for Hillary Clinton. Why? Because theyâve seenÂ before. In a video titled âA Message From Grandma & Grandpa: Weâve Seen This Before,â a group of elderly Jewish Americans plead with their younger generations to get out and vote, and warns against the type of man Donald Trump is. They âenlisted some powerful allies in the effort to defeat Donald Trump: grandparents.â And they arenât holding back: âThis is probably one of the most important elections, because there is so much is at stake.â Of course, their experiences with Germany take front and center: âWe have seen this before. We saw it in Germany, andÂ donât want to see it again.â Their hatred for Trump is not hidden, and for good reason: âTrump is more than a tyrant. Heâs an obnoxiousÂ lying individual and I havenât any respect for him. I have tremendous fears for the country and and for you, my grandchildren.â Adding some lighthearted (but important) humor, one grandparent tells their grandkids: âIf you vote the future is yours. If you donât vote for Hillary, and that crazy man Trump is elected, Iâll haunt you when I die.â Another promises to be a major spoiler: âIâll spoil every episode of âGame of Thrones. When youâre having a dinner party, Iâll come down and say something racist, but if youâre voting for Trump, you probably donât care.â The powerful video, sponsored by Bend the Arc Jewish Action, was released to warn future generations not to forget their history, and to listen to the wisdom of their elders, especially ones that know oppression when they see it: âWe, as Jews, recognize that [Trumpâs] candidacy has echoed times when the Jewish community experienced the dangers of fascism, anti-immigration and persecution against religious minorities.Â Weâve seen this beforeÂ and we wanted to make sure that as Jews we were speaking out boldly and loudly and making sure it was known the Jewish community rejects Trump for the platform of hatred and bigotry that he has unleashed.â Watch the powerful ad here:  
Donald Trump, the supposed “law and order” candidate, painted a very bleak picture of what life in the “inner cities” was like. “We have a situation where we have inner cities, African-Americans, Hispanics are living in hell because it’s so dangerous” said the Republican nominee a few hours earlier. He cited former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s unconstitutional and discriminatory “stop-and-frisk” policy as a solution for crime in urban centers. But his account didn’t match up with the facts, and he was called out by the police department in his own city for his blatant falsehoods and the implication that the NYPD isn’t good at their jobs. The Assistant Commissioner for Communication & Public Information of the NYPD, J. Peter Donald, fact-checked Trump during the debate, and has this to say about the racist Republican’s proposals to reinstate stop-and-frisk after it was ended by Mayor Bloomberg in 2011:   Trump is trying to position himself as “tough on crime” but the reality is his proposals are nothing but dog-whistles for his racist white supremacist followers. Not only was “stop-and-frisk” ineffective, it was very obviously discriminatory against minorities – and after it was ended, crime drastically decreased thanks to new reforms in policing techniques. Trump is trying to sell the American people an apocalyptic vision of America that just doesn’t exist – and the policemen whose support he’s courting aren’t buying it either.  
I’m looking for silver linings this morning, after waking up to news that rioters trashed Charlotte, North Carolina because they didn’t get the facts right. And I think I might have found one… In typical “Don’t Waste A Crisis” Democrat fashion, Queen Hillary tweeted this out about the police shootings in Charlotte and Tulsa, OK. Because who cares about facts when there are political points to be scored! Keith Lamont Scott. Terence Crutcher. Too many others. This has got to end. -H — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 21, 2016  I’m willing to bet that Hillz wouldn’t give a crap about Keith Scott or Terence Crutcher if they hadn’t been black men killed by police officers. But that’s just me. Enter Chris Christie, who definitely knows a political opportunist when he sees one. He pretty much dropped the bomb on Hillary’s racist assumption when calling in to Laura Ingraham’s radio show. And it is GLORIOUS – Christie responds to Hillary citing systemic racism: “She is a disgrace. Its typical HRC. She knows nothing but the mouth never stops.” — Angelo Carusone (@GoAngelo) September 21, 2016  .@GovChristie:’@HillaryClinton Has NO Experience In Law-Enforcement Except Being Interviewed By Them; She’s A Disgrace’ — Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) September 21, 2016  HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA Oh man – even if he’s not running for president, Christie still knows how to call out Hillary’s progressive BS. It’s a beautiful thing. (h/t Twitchy)
There’s a lot to be discussed about last night’s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. One thing that has baffled many is how Hillary seemed so ready with answers and detailed facts and, almost as bizarrely, she didn’t cough or reach for water once. Well, this twitter user might have an answer. Do you see it? I think we all know why #TrumpWon pic.twitter.com/nwZRxvkX81 — USA For Trump 2016 (@USAforTrump2016) September 27, 2016  This wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Is just a trick of light and shadows? A zipper? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her pantsuit? Will you support Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton or another candidate? Share your thoughts! And LIKE this page for the latest TRUMP news. Interested in stopping Hillary? LIKE this page  
For a little over a decade today’s millennials have been described as being part of the “everyone gets a trophy generation.” Effort and standards are a thing of the past, so much so that even the standard to be a victim is at historic lows. Would you believe that the man behind Saturday’s NJ and NYC bombings once claimed to be a victim of “Islamophobia?” This was allegedly such a problem that the attacker Ahmad Khan Rahami and his father once sued the police in Elizabeth New Jersey for discrimination, and also accused other members of the community of discrimination based on religion. The journalists over at the Daily Mail did some digging into the lawsuit, and here’s what they found (courtesy of Louder With Crowder): The prime suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings sued his local police force and claimed they were persecuting him for being a Muslim. Ahmad Rahami said in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey subjected his and his family to discrimination and ‘selective enforcement’ based on their religion. The family claimed that police tried to shut down their chicken restaurant, called First American, too early each night with ‘baseless’ tickets and summonses. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr, 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit was filed in 2011 and reveals that Ahmad has a long history of grievances with city officials, their local police force and people who lived close to them. No, you’re not living in an episode of the Twilight Zone right now, this is real life. Mayor Christian Bollwage insisted to The New York Times that there was no such discrimination. “It was neighbor complaints, it had nothing to do his with ethnicity or religion,” Bollwage said, adding, “It had to do with noise and people congregating on the streets.” Rahami’s family owns a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, NJ called First American Fried Chicken. This is also the same town where five bombs were found at a train station Monday morning. His lawsuit went nowhere, so apparently his strategy in that particular case was that if you can’t beat them in the courts: bomb them instead. Welcome to Obama’s America – where even an Islamic terrorist can play the victim! How insane is this? Get the word out – share this post on Facebook and Twitter. 
Rebecca Francis, winner of the reality television show "Extreme Huntress," has been receiving death threats for pictures that she has posted to social media. The photos show her posing next to animals that she has killed while hunting. Metro reported that the Utah native has killed bears, moose, zebras and antelopes during her hunting career. She recently posed with a big smile next to a dead giraffe and posted it to Facebook. Many social media users reacted negatively; some even said that they wished the hunter was dead. Twitter user @AsapGinger1 wrote, “I know this is very hypocritical of me but I want to f****** shoot her just for this picture.”  Actor Ricky Gervais is also an animal rights supporter and tweeted the photo of Francis next to the dead giraffe. His message was retweeted more than 17,000 times. According to the Independent, Francis has eight children. However, multiple pregnancies and babies have not prevented her from hunting in the United States and Africa. “We hunt elk and deer every year without fail, even through pregnancy, and nursing babies. Our hunting trips are self-guided,” she said.  Francis has also hosted the television show "Eye of the Hunter." She claims to have killed a wide range of animals, including, “A 10 1/2 ft. brown bear, black bear, shiras moose, alaskan moose,  dall sheep, stone sheep, desert bighorn ram, rocky mountain bighorn ram, mule deer, whitetail deer, elk, mountain goat, antelope, arapawa ram, kudu, zebra, black wildebeest, giraffe, springbuck, blesbuck, lynx, badger, and squirrel.” Read Gervais' Tweet below: What must've happened to you in your life to make you want to kill a beautiful animal & then lie next to it smiling? pic.twitter.com/DyYw1T5ck2 Sources: Metro, Independent / Photo Source: Metro
A reporter for VICE News was arrested this weekend trying to get his press pass from the Trump campaign. Donald Trump attacked New York Times writer Maureen Dowd on Twitter for a negative story â Â a routine practice for the Republican presidential nominee. Heâs blacklisted reporters throughout the election and treated them so badly theyâve had to be escorted out of his rallies by Secret Service officers. He says he wants to âopen upâ libel laws, which would weaken journalistsâ ability to report hard-hitting stories. He sued websites for writing that his wife and theÂ potential first lady was rumored to be a Slovenian hooker. And Monday, Trump made a comment about the press that is arguably one of his worst yet. In an interview with âFox & Friendsâ on Fox News, Trump was speaking about the latest terrorist attacks in New York and New Jersey that occurred over the weekend. After blaming refugees, despite there being absolutely no evidence the refugee program is to blame, the hosts mentioned that people donât need to be radicalized in Syria or IraqÂ becauseÂ they can simply go online to be indoctrinated by terrorist groups. Trump turned his sites on a constitutionally protected right, the freedom of press and expression: âTheyâre all talking about it so wonderfully because, you know, itâs called âfreedom of the press,â where you buy magazines and they tell you how to make these same bombs that I saw.â Trump then said he was totally in favor of freedom of the press, then turned right around and shat on freedom of the press saying they are âinciting violence.â âThey tell you how to make bombs. We should arrest the people that do that because theyâre participating in crime. Instead, they say âoh no you canât do anything, thatâs freedom of expression.â â And Trump also alluded to the fact that information on the internet should not be freely available (kind of like China): âThe websites are the same thing, those people should be arrested. Theyâre inciting violence, okay? Theyâre making violence possible. They should be arrested immediatelyâ¦yet we donât want to touch them because of freedom of speech.â Incitement is not a constitutionally protected right, but itâs hard to prove that by making information available a website owner or writer is intentionally inciting a specific crime. But if the bar is lowered, Trump himself could be arrested for incitement, after telling his supporters to take out protesters at his rallies, or his comment that âSecond Amendment peopleâ could stop Clinton. Trumpâs problem with the media is troubling. Using these latest attacks to go after constitutionally protected freedomsÂ reeks of Bush-era fear-mongering that led to the U.S. giving up privacy rights to the government. Trump has left a long trail of breadcrumbs showing us heâs on a path to destroy the First Amendment as we know it. Freedom of expression and press is considered to be the fourth pillar of democracy in this country, without those freedoms the press is just a propaganda machine for the person in power. Only a small man fears information. Featured Image via Getty Images/Gustavo Caballero
Kathleen Willey, one well known former mistress of Bill Clinton, among an estimated 2,000 women over the course of his political career, was asked if she would attend Monday’s Presidential debate if invited by Trump. Her response? “I would refrain for now. Let her do herself in on her own.” She continued, explaining that if every woman Bill Clinton had an affair with over the years was present at the debates, it would fill the hall. See her comment below: “Most of us are well known and our stories have been repeated several times over the years, but what concerns me the most are the voices of my sisters who are still afraid to come out of the darkness. I have communicated with a number of them and they are still terrified of publicly sharing their experiences with the Clintons. The real story here is not one of our presence in the front row at any of these debates, but the unhindered lust for power that the Clintons have displayed for decades. Hillary Clinton has lied, cheated and stolen our lives from us. People have died in her wake of deceit. We could fill the entire audience. I would like to see the day when these women can step into the light and share their stories of brutality, terror and intimidation without the kind of fear of intimidation and recrimination that we have experienced for far too many years.” The Clinton machine has spent years terrorizing Bill’s mistresses. And much of that was orchestrated by Hillary, who, for all intents and purposes is the attack dog that keeps her husband from having to answer for his sleazy lifestyle.   Hillary would be a shameful President and an exceedingly poor example to our daughters. She models the “break the rules to get ahead” mentality. Just being a woman does not make her a good role model. American women and girls deserve better. They deserve a woman President who is honest. And Hillary certainly isn’t. No matter who sits in the front row at the debate, Hillary will still be there; lying, fabricating, screeching and coughing…and that’s just the introductions. Trump will wipe the floor with Wicked Hillary. And all those women victimized by Bill and Hillary over the years will be laughing hysterically. What goes around, comes around. And you, Mrs. Bill Clinton, are overdue for some karma. Never Hillary.   
The black man, Keith Lamont Scott, who was shot by a black police officer in North Carolina, was caught on dash cam footage getting out of his car with a gun drawn from a thigh holster he was wearing. He got back in the car and then got back out again, brandishing the weapon at the police – brandishing does not mean pointing by the way. The officer shot and killed Scott because he was a clear and present danger to the officers. Scott’s family has now watched the video from several angles showing that Scott did indeed have a gun and was threatening the officers after repeatedly being told to drop his weapon. Now the family has no comment and neither does their attorney. Sounds like a justified shooting to me. They lied about the book and ginned up riots there. Then they had a Muslim spokesman come in and incite violence. They should all be arrested as far as I’m concerned.  From Young Conservatives: The family of Keith Lamont Scott, the black man killed by a black cop after being ordered repeatedly to drop his weapon, said “no comment” when asked after watching video of the incident if the police were in the right. If that isn’t an admission then their lawyer wouldn’t have told them to say “no comment.” Clearly, the video must’ve shown that Scott was not obeying police officers (which we already know to be the case). Had the family’s lawyers even for a second thought the cops were out of line, they would’ve instructed the family to scream bloody murder. Tell me I’m wrong. I’m not, but you can tell me anyways. These riots cost the life of one protester and got not only other protesters hurt, but police officers as well. An emergency was declared by the governor and the National Guard had to come in. These riots will carry a heavy price tag. The police chief says there is no definitive proof in the video that Scott aimed the gun at the officers. It doesn’t matter. He had it in his hand and would not drop it. The officer that shot him followed procedure and the video bears that out. That is why the family is not screaming bloody murder over the video. They saw that Scott was indeed a threat and that is why he was taken down.

Soros believes that he is God and that he controls America!  Interesting opinion as he is an atheist! Well, he has been doing a pretty good job at trying to control America and that is FOR SURE! AmericanToday reports: George Soros claims he is a god and “the creator of everything,” however the billionaire globalist also warns he is a “self-centred” god who believes “normal rules do not apply” to him. “I fancied myself as some kind of god …” he wrote. “If truth be known, I carried some rather potent messianic fantasies with me from childhood, which I felt I had to control, otherwise they might get me in trouble.“ When asked by Britain’s Independent newspaper to elaborate on that statement, Soros doubled down: “It is a sort of disease when you consider yourself some kind of god, the creator of everything, but I feel comfortable about it now since I began to live it out.“ “Next to my fantasies about being God, I also have very strong fantasies of being mad,” Soros once confided on British television. “In fact, my grandfather was actually paranoid. I have a lot of madness in my family. So far I have escaped it.” Soros has made his wealth on the backs of millions in poverty, yet he is the king of decrying how unfair America is because of its greatness. He has, in fact, created more poverty around the world than he could ever complain about!  Why doesn’t he just give away his money to the poor, and live as he would like others to live? Because he is just another far left hypocrite who cares about no one except George Soros. Ugly he is, on the inside and out! It is OK! Someday George, you WILL know who God is! Philippians 2:9 Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, 10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, 11 and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.     
The JonBenet Ramsey case has plagued America for 20 years, now. Who would want to murder such a beautiful young girl? What would their motive be? How could they have pulled it off in a way that would stump law enforcement for two decades? In the last month, stories about the case, including a CBS special, A&E documentary and a Dr. Phil interview with the girl’s brother, have come to the forefront. Have we finally evolved enough technologically speaking that we can now determine who murdered little JonBenet Ramsey?  The biggest break in this case was the audio picked up by the 911 dispatcher after JonBenet’s mother, Patsy Ramsey, tried to hang up the phone. At the time this occurred, technology was just not good enough to determine who was speaking or what they said. Now, however, the audio could be slowed down and we can finally hear this potentially critical piece of audio. Keep in mind as you read this that JonBenet’s father John Ramsey was and perhaps still is considered a suspect in his daughter’s murder. From PerezHilton: What Clemente (pictured above) and the rest of his team discovered was a voice that sounded like the beauty pageant contestant’s father, John Ramsey, saying, “We’re not speaking to you,” followed by Patsy saying, “What did you do? and “Help me, Jesus.” On top of that, it also sounds like, what specialists believe to be a small child, possibly nine-year-old Burke Ramsey, saying, “What did you find?” After this point, a female voice can be heard saying, “We’ve called the police, now what?” Additionally, the ransom note was determined to have taken approximately 21 minutes to write according to investigators and is said to have contained several lines from the movies Dirty Harry and Speed. Another odd coincidence was the fact that the ransom demanded was about equal to the amount that John Ramsey was given as a bonus that year. Perhaps the most bizarre finding of all was the “maternal language” that linguistics experts say was noted in the letter. Not only this, but the misspellings that were included in the letter appeared to have been placed there on purpose, so suspicion would point to a person for whom English is not their native language. But as the experts concluded, English was the first language of whomever wrote the letter. Could all of this information be pointing not only to the father, but to the parents as a team? 
Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s media team went to work tonight on Donald Trump and the torrent of offensive statements, lies, and delusions that he said during tonight’s debate. Cataloging all of the most egregious offenses, it’s a laundry list of reasons – any one of which should be a disqualifier – of why Trump would be a catastrophe as the President of the United States. 1.Trump mocked former Miss Universe Alicia Machado’s weight and heritage, calling her names like “Miss Housekeeping” and “Miss Piggy.” Huffington Post, May 23, 2016 2. Donald Trump: “Pregnancy is never–it’s a wonderful thing for the woman. It’s a wonderful thing for the husband. It’s certainly an inconvenience for a business…And whether people want to say that or not, the fact is it is an inconvenience for a person that is running a business.”  5. In the 1970s, Trump’s real estate company was sued by the Department of Justice for discriminating against minority applicants in both New York and Virginia–in New York, their applications were marked “C” for colored. The Washington Post, January 23, 2016 6. Trump falsely accused Hillary Clinton of starting the “birther” rumors about President Obama. He promoted the conspiracy for years after his campaign says he “ended” it. 7. Trump is wildly misleading when he says violent crime is on the rise. 8. Trump claims he’s the “law and order” candidate, but he opposes gun-free zones and supports Americans owning assault weapons. 9. Part of a history of stiffing his contractors, Trump refused to pay an architect what he was owed after designing the clubhouse for one of Trump’s golf courses. Trump offered just one-sixth the original invoice, and then bullied him with a “take-it or you’ll have to sue me” approach. 10. In the words of his campaign manager, Trump “built a lot of his business on the backs of the little guy” and has a history of “not paying contractors after [they have helped him] build something.” 11. Trump regularly lies and misleads when it comes to Hillary Clinton’s emails. 12. Trump has repeatedly refused to release his tax returns, breaking a decades-long precedent of transparency for presidential nominees. 13. Donald Trump said he’s doing “almost 120 deals” outside the U.S., but since he hasn’t released his tax returns we don’t know with who or for what. 14. Donald Trump is proposing a tax plan with a “Trump Loophole” that gives the wealthy a backdoor tax cut, establishing a 15% rate for business owners like Donald Trump. 16. Trump’s economic plans will add $5.3 trillion to the national debt, according to a non-partisan analysis. 17. According to a nonpartisan analysis, Donald Trump’s plans would cost the economy 3.5 million jobs. Hillary Clinton’s would create 10 million jobs. 19. On Libyan intervention: 21. Trump said that Hillary Clinton wants to create “totally open borders,” a claim Politifact rated “false.” 22. Trump likes to say that Hillary Clinton is the founder of ISIS. She’s not. (And neither is Barack Obama.)
Thereâs already been hints from NBC News that Lester Holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable â except by Hillary Clinton. But to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong: While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics â¦.Â Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage. After Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates. The Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters: For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator â¦ to call out those lies and to do that in real time. Unfortunately, with Trumpâs impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, itâs somehow up to Hillary Clinton to âshineâ at the debate if she hopes to âwin.â This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent. Hopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it. If there is one thing this election has shown us, itâs that journalism is dying, if not already dead. 
Millions of Americans nationwide are upset with the Black Lives Matter movement because they only appear after a widely publicized cop-on-citizen shooting. It would appear, based on just that alone, that they are only in it for the media attention and the money that comes along with that. Of course, there is also the looting and rioting and burning of private property, but they don’t want us to focus on that because racism or something.  A 15 year-old kid was found burnt and tossed in a garbage can. He was the kind of kid that every parent hopes for, helping out neighbors by walking their dogs, always following curfew and was always good-natured. But on September 16th, Demetrius Griffin Jr. didn’t come home at curfew. That is when his mother realized something was very, very wrong. After his body was found, his mother and aunt pleaded with the community to come forward with any information they had about his murder(ers). ‘What I need this community to understand is when you took this baby’s life you affected this whole family. You didn’t just take his life. And if you’re out here and you see this and you’re listening, look at what you did to this family.” When his aunt Virginia Riley took to the microphone, she called out Black Lives Matter, who has been noticeably silent during this whole case. “Don’t turn your back this time, y’all. We really need to find the solution or real, I mean, if you all talk about ‘Black Lives Matter,’ this life did matter.“ Unfortunately, this is just one of the 500 murders that have taken place in Chicago during 2016 alone. Without a doubt, this is one of the most heartbreaking cases of murder that the country has ever seen, but it will fade from the headlines soon enough. The nation will forget young Demetrius’ face, but a family and a community will be affected forever. They will have to walk to the mailbox remembering when Demetrius would walk the neighborhood dogs around the block. They will continue living in the house filled with his laughter and memories of his adorable face and piercing blue eyes. Black lives DO matter, just as much as every other life on the planet. This young boy had his life RIPPED from him by a thug who doesn’t know what it is to love someone more than you love yourself. We need to make it a point to keep stories like this in the headlines until it is solved and the creature or creatures who did this are behind bars. 
Weirdest thing, United States Immigration made a mistake. Just kidding it’s not weird, in fact they just caught themselves making 858 mistakes when they mistakenly granted citizenship to immigrants who had pending deportation orders from countries of concern to national security or with high rates of immigration fraud. Oopsie. Don’t worry government everyone makes mistakes and it’s only OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AT RISK!!!!! I mean c’mon guys, this isn’t like accidentally leaving the onion on a burger when the customer says ‘hold the onion’. A human being and their paperwork is much larger than a burger. Homeland Security Department’s inspector general found that these particular immigrants used different names and birthdates and their fingerprints were missing from the database. The report does not identify any of the immigrants by name, but Inspector General John Roth’s auditors said they were all from “special interest countries” — those that present a national security concern for the United States — or neighboring countries with high rates of immigration fraud. The report did not identify those countries. DHS officials identified an additional 953 people who had been naturalized despite outstanding deportation orders, though auditors couldn’t determine if those immigrants had digital fingerprints on file or not. Roth’s report said fingerprints are missing from federal databases for as many as 315,000 immigrants with final deportation orders or who are fugitive criminals. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has not reviewed about 148,000 of those immigrants’ files to add fingerprints to the digital record. The biggest danger in mistakenly awarding citizenship to someone who should be deported is that as a US Citizen they would be able to apply for jobs that require security clearance. So far 3 of these mistaken ‘citizens’ acquired aviation and transportation credentials. A 4th person had become a law enforcement officer. For now immigration and DHS are scrambling to fill the holes in the files and implement a system to evaluate each case of the immigrants improperly granted citizenship. 
People can’t just leave well enough alone, can they? They can’t just let problems clear themselves up without trying to make things 1,000,000 times worse. Well, maybe not so much “people” as B.J. Murphy, a Muslim man who was chosen by Keith Lamont Scott’s family to speak about the man’s shooting death.  Of course, he couldn’t just leave without praising Allah and ordering more violence from the rioters who, for some reason, think that stealing TVs from Walmart is the appropriate way to “protest police brutality.” After telling the angry mob that blacks “don’t get no justice,” (because English is hard for some people) he said that he’s not “telling our brothers and sisters to stop,” referring to the crime that has been committed in the name of “justice.” You know, the same justice that they ain’t gettin’ none of? Or something. His message was apparently SO effective that, according to the Daily Caller, Charlotte protesters were chanting “We’re like the Taliban!” That’s what we need, Muslims taking advantage of angry Americans and creating more home-grown terrorists. Can this guy be arrested for inciting violence? Maybe for inciting a riot? Oh, what am I saying… he’s one of the “protected classes” in America. The only thing the government would do to him is give him a federal job overseeing refugees and their paperwork. 
Freedom is the bedrock that this nation was built upon. The problem is, liberals hate freedom. Oh, sure — they pay lip service to its importance, but ultimately, they want people to be subservient to a liberal-controlled government. They may not want a tyrannical king, but a tyrannical government of socialist-loving politicians pushing government-controlled everything is A-OK with them. They can’t ever say this out loud, though. Which makes the speech Obama just gave to the United Nations rather surprising. Obama actually admitted that he thinks it’s necessary for the United States to give up a little liberty… you know, for “safety”. Tuesday, Obama spoke to the United Nations General Assembly. “We can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations, like my own, accept constraints,” he said. “Sometimes I am criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions. But I am convinced in the long run, giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to the international rules over the long-term enhances our security.”   So evidently, Obama believes that we should relinquish more of our freedom and sovereignty so that the international community can rule over us. How this will make the country safer, he didn’t explain. But safety relies on us bringing more Muslim refugees into the United States. “Ultimately our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees,” Obama said. Obama may want to take a look at how Germany is doing. Accepting tons of refugees without screening them first has certainly not made their country safer — it’s made it more dangerous. And right here in the United States, we have had multiple terrorist attacks over the last year.   How allowing over 110,000 Muslim refugees with no vetting whatsoever into our country will keep us safe is not something that Obama can actually explain, because it’s a completely ludicrous idea. And turning the United States into a country that has to answer to the United Nations before we act on anything doesn’t make us safer, either. It’s a typical liberal idea: something that is nonsensical and useless, yet will weaken the country and strip Americans of their constitutionally-protected rights. But hey, who needs freedom, right? Obama has an agenda to push. 
After an exhausting day of ruining the lives of everyday Americans, rumor has it Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump likes to curl up in his gold-plated bed and relax with a book by his favorite author – Adolf Hitler. Long before Trump began his run for president where racism, bigotry, hatred, division, and fear became the pillars of his campaign he was studying the work of man who is responsible for the third-most murders in human history. According to a 1990 Vanity Fair article written by Marie Brenner, Trump’s ex-wife Ivana, spilled the beans on Trump’s love affair with Hitler: Ivana Trump told her lawyer Michael Kennedy that from time to time her husband reads a book of Hitler’s collected speeches, My New Order, which he keeps in a cabinet by his bed. Kennedy now guards a copy of My New Order in a closet at his office, as if it were a grenade. Hitler’s speeches, from his earliest days up through the Phony War of 1939, reveal his extraordinary ability as a master propagandist. When the pathologically lying Trump was confronted about owning the book he feigned ignorance. The interviewer asked him, “Did your cousin John give you the Hitler speeches?” Trump was shocked and attempted to deflect the question by asking a question, “Who told you that?” but he then confirmed he owned the book, “Actually, it was my friend Marty Davis from Paramount who gave me a copy of “Mein Kampf”, and he’s a Jew.” That Trump would even admit to owning the book is bad enough, but his justification for owning the book offers a window into his contorted carnival house of mirrors logic. Trump reasons it’s okay to read about Hitler hating Jews, because his Jewish friend gifted it to him, and wouldn’t it be rude to discard the gift without giving it a thorough read? Trump lied about lying, as is his standard fare. Marty Davis did indeed confirm giving Trump the book, but it was Hitler’s “My Jewish Order” not “Mein Kampf.” Whether or not that is worse is up for debate. Davis went on to say he isn’t Jewish, but that he and Trump are friends. Then, likely after realizing he had outed himself as xenophobic towards Jewish people, Trump back peddled claiming even if he had Hitler’s book he wouldn’t read it. Trump said, “If I had these speeches, and I am not saying that I do, I would never read them.” What does he mean he’s not saying he has the speeches? He literally confirmed he had them moments earlier! While it is an exercise in one’s gag reflex to picture Trump in bed, it is natural to picture him with a Nazi swastika draped over his headboard, while filling his brain with strategies to bamboozle and terrorize the public. Trump’s campaign has been ripped from Hitler’s playbook of demonizing minorities and blaming them for the ills of a nation, which is all the more reason why Trump must be prevented from winning the presidency in less than seven weeks. If Trump has been studying Hitler for almost 30 years it is too generous of a leap to believe Trump was only interested in Hitler’s rise to power, and in fact will continue to crib Hitler’s strategies if and when he assumes power himself.
Another day, another racist dog whistle echoed by Donald Trump. While the urban unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina continues, Trump â in a pathetic attempt to sound presidential â blamed the rioting on drug use, without citing any facts to back up his claim. The comment, made in a speech in Pittsburgh, was off-script: âIf youâre not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what youâre watching on television.â Somehow, everyone but Donald Trump is unaware of the âfactorsâ contributing to a legitimate unrest that stems not from drugs, but from the black community being continuously fed up with racial injustices and the murders of unarmed men who posed no credible threat to law enforcement. What Donald Trump is seeking to do is sow the seeds of a racist, stereotype that plagues this country: blacks are on drugs, and it makes them violent. The facts are out there: white people do more drugs, and serve less time. This notion that because black Americans are fed up with injustice is somehow attributed to drug use or a yearning for drugs is, yes, racist. It reaffirms peopleâs ignorant and misguided stereotypes about urban black communities while simultaneously deflecting from other drug crises that are affecting white communities at much more critical levels. Recent findings in theÂ American Journal of Public Health, the abuse and dependency on âhard drugsâ areÂ âless common among delinquent African American youth than those who are non-Hispanic white.â White people, in general, are also more likely to deal drugs than black people. So the people selling drugs to our kids, parents, and members of the community are more likely to be white than black, but yet black people are still seen as the culprits of Americaâs drug problem. And Donald Trumpâs claim, no matter how minuscule it may be, just makes the problem worse. Instead of accusing black Americans of being drug-induced degenerates, maybe Trump should travel up to New Hampshire and Maine, where an unprecedented opioid addiction is killing hundreds of white citizens every year, and nothing is being done to combat it. Donald Trump says the unrest in Charlotte would not happen in a Trump administration. Would New Englandâs drug epidemic be stopped under his administration? Would the killing of unarmed black people â which is the only contribution to the unrest â stop in his administration? Would he end the dog whistle stereotypes that continue to blatantly fester in peopleâs minds, regardless of what the facts are? Trumpâs going to get a huge wake up call with black voters in November if he keeps this up. 
If you’ve spent much time on social media, you might notice that almost regardless of the subject, a string of anti-Hillary memes seems to just automatically show up. That’s not a coincidence. It’s all part of a highly coordinated “shitposting” designed by billionaire and Oculus founder, 24-year-old Palmer Luckey. Luckey is best known as a boy genius who invented his version of virtual reality goggles, called the Oculus Rift. Facebook bought Luckey’s company in 2014 for $2 billion. Forbes estimates that he’s worth about $700 million. The epicenter of his trolling seems to come from Reddit, where he uses the pseudonym “NimbleRichMan.” Luckey is a backer, likely the key backer of a pro-Trump 501(c)(4) charitable “social welfare” organization that’s dedicated to backing Trump. If you think that sounds seriously sketchy, you’d be right. According to the IRS, a 501(c)(4) is not supposed to have politics as its primary activity, and any politicking it does is not tax exempt. published an expose on Thursday, which says in part: Nimble America says it’s dedicated to proving that “shitposting is powerful and meme magic is real,” according to the company’s introductory statement, and has taken credit for a billboard its founders say was posted outside of Pittsburgh with a cartoonishly large image of Clinton’s face alongside the words “Too Big to Jail.” “We conquered Reddit and drive narrative on social media, conquered the [mainstream media], now it’s time to get our most delicious memes in front of Americans whether they like it or not,” a representative for the group wrote in an introductory post on Reddit. People on Reddit aren’t happy. In fact, the biggest pro-Trump subreddit, r/The_Donald, refused to believe that Luckey was NimbleRichMan, but Luckey insisted that he’s just the money behind the idea and well, he did it for a lark – because, you know, screwing with the future of the free world is fun! “I’ve got plenty of money,” Luckey added. “Money is not my issue. I thought it sounded like a real jolly good time.” He prides himself on putting out memes that are so bad that even the Trump campaign wouldn’t promote them. Before you think he’s a Millennial who is still angry that Bernie Sanders didn’t win, think again. He has zero problems with money in politics. “The American Revolution was funded by wealthy individuals,” NimbleRichMan wrote on Saturday. Luckey confirmed to The Daily Beast he penned the posts under his Reddit pseudonym. “The same has been true of many movements for freedom in history. You can’t fight the American elite without serious firepower. They will outspend you and destroy you by any and all means.” Luckey isn’t just spending money on anti-Hillary memes. He’s spending money to support Trump. As an early supporter of @Oculus this makes me sick to my stomach. This is the org @PalmerLuckey is backing Cc @TechCrunch @UploadVR pic.twitter.com/athqtwol7e — Cody Brown (@CodyBrown) September 23, 2016  This is a message from @PalmerLuckey, the founder of @Oculus. pic.twitter.com/CWlAA8ugMx — Cody Brown (@CodyBrown) September 23, 2016  Luckey has apparently been banned from Twitter, but that doesn’t mean that Nimble America, along with the backing of white supremacist and Breitbart propagandist, Milo Yiannopoulos. They plan on releasing more memes and purchasing billboards. It’s not clear if Luckey has maintained any sort of relationship with Facebook or if he has pull with the organization. Let’s hope not. While 4Chan, who is responsible for many of the anti-Hillary paid trolls throughout social media, is also associated with r/The_Donald, there’s no evidence, at this point, that Luckey is behind financing that movement. Stay tuned, though. 
In 2004 President George W. Bush ran a hard-fought reelection campaign against a popular, if doofy, Democrat opponent John Kerry. For all of his faults, Kerry was far more well-liked and far less scandal plagued than today’s Democrat candidate. Bush was able to eke out a reelection victory mostly on the shoulders of his decisive reaction to the 9/11 tragedy. In fact, the 2004 election made the phrase “security moms” famous, as the once known “soccer mom” had suddenly awakened to our dangerous new world where Islamic terrorism was the reality and her “mama bear” instincts had taken over. The “security mom” knew she had to do all she could to care for her loved ones, and that now meant using her vote to keep them safe. Fast forward 12 years to the 2016 presidential election and the new generation of “security moms” will soon be playing a pivotal role (again) in another national election. The 2016 version of these security minded voters seem to be preparing to hand the presidency to GOP candidate Donald Trump, and the events of this past weekend explain why. On Saturday morning a pipe bomb exploded just before the start of a 5k fun run in Seaside Park, New Jersey. The event was called off and authorities swept the area finding two more unexploded devices. Later that night, a pressure cooker bomb exploded in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood, injuring 29 people and sending the city into a panic. Shortly after the explosion authorities swept the surrounding neighborhood and found another unexploded device a few blocks away. Come Sunday morning, liberals and their friends in the media were busy condemning Donald Trump’s comments about the explosions being “bombs” and about the likelihood that we were witnessing a terrorist act. Trump’s opponents were practically hyperventilating about his “rash” response and his “haste” to judgment, all while arguing that there was “no evidence” of a connection to Islam or to terrorist organizations. Then late Sunday evening authorities arrested five “persons of interest” around the same time that 5 more bombs were being discovered in an Elizabeth, New Jersey train station. By early Monday morning police had captured Ahmad Khan Rahami, a naturalized American citizen of Afghani descent, who was living in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Rahami, it turns out, was a “known wolf” with ties to international Muslim terrorism. By the time the East Coast was waking up, liberals were beginning to realize that Donald Trump had been right all along… Consider New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s comments on Sunday: Absent a motivation, Mr. de Blasio suggested the word terrorism should not be used, shaking his head in disapproval at the notion that the basic facts of the bombing could be described that way. “Here is what we know: It was intentional, it was a violent act, it was certainly a criminal act, it was a bombing — that’s what we know,” he said on Sunday, flanked by law enforcement officials at Police Headquarters in Lower Manhattan. “To understand there were any specific motivations, political motivations, any connection to an organization — that’s what we don’t know.” The liberal reticence at calling terrorism terrorism never ceases to amaze me. It’s as though de Blasio believes that if you say the word terrorism you automatically mean that a Muslim person has carried out a violent act. Taking his own words – “It was intentional, it was a violent act, it was certainly a criminal act, it was a bombing…” this is the very definition of terrorism. It’s an act meant to incite a reaction. The only reason anyone would ever set off a bomb without some other concurring criminal act (like using a bomb to rob a bank), would be for terroristic purposes. Yet, de Blasio couldn’t bring himself to use the word and instead just described the act of terrorism to reporters. Even New York’s liberal Governor Andrew Cuomo (D-NY), who was slow to call the act terrorism on Saturday, had changed his tune by Sunday. “A bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism. A bomb going off is generically a terrorist activity.” But by Monday de Blasio’s tune finally changed. “We have reason to believe this was an act of terror,” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said. A-duh. Here’s a newsflash, Bill… every other thinking person in America has already come to this conclusion. Thanks for joining us. Meanwhile, while de Blasio was busy dissembling, Hillary Clinton was busy using the terrorism to attack Donald Trump for being to hard on terrorism. I kid you not. Clinton’s argument is that Donald Trump’s mean words are going to make the terrorists dislike us even more, so they’re going to do more terroristy things. “I don’t want to speculate but here’s what we know about I think it is important for voters to hear this and weigh it in making their choice in November,” Clinton said. “We know that a lot of the rhetoric used by Donald Trump is being seized upon by terrorists.“ Clinton says Trump’s rhetoric has “given aid and comfort” to terrorists. Phrase is definition of treason. — Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) September 19, 2016  This is an amazing argument to make, considering that the Obama/Clinton foreign policy era has been one of appeasement and uber-careful rhetoric (when it comes to Islam) and yet, Islamic terrorism is worse today than ever before! Ultimately, it won’t be the cavalcade of corruption, or the litany of scandals, or the lies, or her obviously failing health that ends Hillary Clinton’s hopes of being President. No, it will be the glaring differences between Clinton and Trump on dealing with the very real threat we face from Islamic terrorism. More Americans will decide that to continue the Obama/Clinton policy of appeasement and apology would be insanity, and that America would be safer handing the reins of leadership to Donald Trump. The liberal response to this weekend’s terrorism is why Donald Trump will be elected the next President of the United States, and it’s why the terrorist supporters at CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood are so worried.

Holy cow, I started crying when I read this post. Mark Ross had just found out that his sister had been killed in a car accident by some dumb punk. His number 1 priority was to get to his mom to comfort her a couple states away. He had a friend drive him even though his friend had a suspended license. In Ohio, they were pulled over for a traffic violation and Ross was thinking, “We’re going to jail,” because his friend was driving illegally and he had a warrant out for his arrest.   The State Trooper had the car towed so they were stranded. Ross, breaking into tears explained to the other police officer who showed up, Sgt. David Robison, that his sister was just killed and he was trying to get to his mom to comfort her. Instead of arresting him, Sgt. Robison offered to drive him 100 miles (as far as he could go) to drop him closer to family. Just as Robison was dropping him off, he asked if he could pray for him. Ross’ Facebook post explains the moment, “He REACHES OVER AND BEGAN PRAYING OVER ME AND MY FAMILY.” Ross then goes on to explain to his friends that, “Everybody knows how much I dislike Cops, but I am truly Grateful for this Guy. He gave me hope.” The one thing you can get from this story is that ALL Lives Matter and true humanity doesn’t see color. This cop helped a young man who was in pain because THAT is humanity and THAT is what police officers do. They are not trained to do it, it is in their blood. Most people join the police force because they want to help people. I am grateful for this Christian man who helped a young man gain hope and comfort. This nation doesn’t need a movement of Black Lives Matter or Any Lives Matter… this nation needs more Christian people doing their duty as Christians to succor the weak or weary. Our national campaign shouldn’t be #BLM but #WWJD. We all need to remember when we go to work, the grocery store or drive down the street… what would Jesus do, what would he do for YOU? What HAS Jesus done for your family? How can you reciprocate Jesus’ love and be more like Him who suffered every inhumanity there was and then rose above it all? Thanks Mark Ross for giving me my perspective back. I’m grateful you posted this. God Bless your family in this time of need. Here’s his selfie with the Sgt. This is what he wrote about it: At 3am I got a phone call stating that my sister had been killed in a car accident due to some young dumb punk! I haven’t slept and instantly got on the road. Of course we were speeding, trying to get back to Detroit. And we got pulled over in Ohio. I knew I was going to Jail due to a petty warrant. The police called Wayne county and they refused to come get me because of the distance. I explained to the officer that my sister had died and that I needed to get to my mother asap. I broke down crying and he saw the sincerity in my cry. He REACHES OVER AND BEGAN PRAYING OVER ME AND MY FAMILY. He offered to bring me 100 miles further to Detroit because they towed the vehicle. Everybody knows how much I dislike Cops but I am truly Greatful for this Guy. He gave me hope   
Adam Walinsky once worked for President John F. Kennedy. He wrote speeches for Bobby (RFK) Kennedy, and Bill Clinton once worked on his National Committee for the Police Corps. He is a longtime Democrat operative, politician, and leader, and in a recent article for Politico, Walinsky shocked the nation when he announced that he would be voting for Donald Trump on November 8th. I was a Democrat all my life. I came to Washington to serve President John Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy. When the president was murdered and his brother struck off on his own, I joined his Senate campaign and staff as his legislative assistant and speechwriter, until his presidential campaign ended with his own assassination. I ran on a (losing) Democratic ticket in the New York state elections of 1970. When I was working to enact my own program of police reform in the 1980s and 1990s, then-Governor Bill Clinton was chairman of my National Committee for the Police Corps. This year, I will vote to elect Donald Trump as president of the United States. The question many are asking today is, why? Why would a long-time and highly respected Democrat defect at such a crucial time in our history? Why would Walinsky abandon the most establishment-friendly candidate in recent memory, to vote for a Republican outsider who eschews much of the Democrat Party platform. So profound a change, and a decent respect for old friendships, requires me to deliver a public accounting for this decision. Walinsky focused on one key aspect of the campaign – foreign policy: Here it is. John and Robert Kennedy devoted their greatest commitments and energies to the prevention of war and the preservation of peace. To them that was not an abstract formula but the necessary foundation of human life. But today’s Democrats have become the Party of War: a home for arms merchants, mercenaries, academic war planners, lobbyists for every foreign intervention, promoters of color revolutions, failed generals, exploiters of the natural resources of corrupt governments. Walinsky hammers one key area of today’s Democrat Party that many libertarians and some conservatives have decried for years. The Democrat Party is the party of hypocrisy when it comes to war and foreign policy. The very same people who for years marched against war during the Bush administration, have fallen silent during the Obama years. This reality is stunning, considering that President Obama has led us through 8 years of constant warfare (numbers below accurate as of May 2016): —2,499 U.S. soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan and Iraq so far under President Obama, according to the independent Iraq Coalition Casualty Count. —Of those, 1,906 have been killed in and around Afghanistan, and 593 in Iraq. —Under Obama, the United States has been at war for 2,687 days. That’s longer than under George W. Bush — or any other U.S. president, for that matter. —Obama has conducted airstrikes on seven countries: Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria. (That’s three more countries than George W. Bush bombed.) —U.S. combat forces are deployed on the ground in three countries: Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. That’s one more war than Obama inherited, and which his successor will likely have to contend with.  Because of these truths and the reality that much of Obama’s foreign policy vision was crafted, developed, and carried out by Hillary Clinton, have led Walinsky to the realization that Donald Trump may be the most likely candidate to bring peace to our nation. Throughout this campaign, he has said that as president, he would quickly sit down with President Putin and seek relaxation of tensions between our nations, and possible collaboration in the fight against terrorists. On this ground alone, he marks himself as greatly superior to all his competitors, earlier in the primaries and now in the general election… Donald Trump has been mocked mercilessly for saying, “America first.” But to demand that all the actions of government, at home or abroad, be first directed at the interests and well-being of our own country is not old-fashioned or outmoded. Rather it represents the deepest wisdom and tradition of American statesmen from the founders on. Only with a clear vision of what is truly in the interests of our nation and our fellow citizens, and a full commitment to those interests, can we act wisely at home and in the world beyond. I urge you to read all of Walinsky’s well-crafted argument in support of Donald Trump. He delivers paragraphs of excoriating commentary against the Democrat Party, while explaining why, despite his faults, Donald Trump may indeed be the man for this moment. If you believe America is starved for change, and many voters do, then the only candidate who offers any hope of real change is Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton not only represents “more of the same” from Washington, D.C., she is the progenitor, and an ardent supporter of many of our worst, most ineffective policies, ideas, and plans. Voting against Clinton doesn’t only mean voting for change; it means voting against some of our worst political failures of the last 30 years.

As far as terrorism is concerned, yesterday was a good and a bad day for Americans. In addition to a knife wielding Allah chanting attacker in a Minnesota mall, who injured 7 before being shot dead by an off duty police officer, there was an undetonated bomb found in Seaside Park in NJ and 2 bombs found in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, one undetonated and one detonated, which injured 29 people. At this juncture, police are saying that all three devices appear to have been made by the same person. It was a good day in that no intended victims died. And it was a bad day in that these incidents expose how vulnerable Americans are to these kinds of attacks, especially in urban areas with large numbers of people in them. Terrorists in America look like regular people. They are not wearing all black outfits and masks, or marching in groups down the middle of the street. They look like shoppers, coworkers and fellow subway riders. It is difficult to identify terrorists and that makes it difficult to discover their plans and stop therm. What we need to remember is this; these are not random attacks. They are, most times, planned out and carried out by radical Islamic terrorists who absolutely hate western civilization. When or if we see something odd or suspicious, we must say something. If a guy is standing in line at Walmart buying 4 pressure cookers, that’s something odd. We cannot assume that everyone around has our best interests in mind. If you see something, say something.  We need a President who will get serious about vetting immigrants, stemming the tide of refugees and illegal immigrants and keeping Americans safe. We know which person will do that if elected and it isn’t Hillary. If Hillary wins, she will bring more refugees in. She has said it. If Trump wins, he will put an end to our destructive immigration policy. And that is what he has said. The safety of Americans on our own soil must be paramount. It is time to get serious about which people we let in and which ones we don’t. There are 7 knife victims and 29 bombing victims who deserved better. They deserve a government that puts them first. While the knife attacker in the mall was thankfully taken out by an armed officer, New York City Police Commissioner James P. O’Neill said “I am concerned, we have a bomb that detonated and no one apprehended.” That’s right, the bomber is still out there. If you see something say something…before you can’t.   
What a freaking disgrace Mohamed Elibiary is. And a stone cold enemy within as well. After the IED went off in Manhattan last night, instead of going for Jihadist terrorists, who I am 1000% certain are behind it, he turned around and had the nerve to blame Donald Trump for the blast that injured 29. That’s rich coming from a guy who was booted from the DHS Advisory Council for being too radical. A man who has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and has said the US is an Islamic country and an ISIS caliphate was inevitable. This is textbook… Islamists and Marxists always point their finger at people and blame them for things that they do or sanction. Here we go again. Trump no more had ties to this than the Man in the Moon… to say he does is a monstrous lie and libelous, not to mention extremely incendiary. If I remember correctly, he was in the air when it happened, not that it matters. Pressure cooker bombs are the signature of Islamic terrorism… think Boston Marathon. From The Federalist Papers Project: Because I guess he’s just kind of a dirtbag, Mohamed Elibiary again stuck his foot in his Muslim mouth and decided to suggest that Donald Trump was behind the New York City bombing Saturday night. It doesn’t matter that Elibiary was terminated as a member of the Department of Homeland Security Advisory Council because of his radical views. It doesn’t even matter that Elibiary said that an ISIS caliphate was “inevitable” or that America is an “Islamic Country.” All of this got him in hot water. Now he’s just kind of a has-been … roaming about the Internet, desperate to stay relevant. Perhaps that’s why he chose Saturday night to make this incendiary comment:  He’s not only the first to mention it, he’ll probably be the only one. This guy is hateful. He hates American, Trump and ANYTHING that is not Islamic. Three months ago, he attacked the Coptic Christian community in Egypt. After a prominent Coptic businessman expressed support for Trump, Elibiary ominously warned that support would be “not good 4 Copts in Egypt.” Yes, I know his kind well… I have friends that are Coptic and one is very connected in Egypt. That was a threat. He also spoke in December of 2004 at a conference honoring virulently anti-American Iranian Ayatollah Khomeini. Elibiary is a radical Islamist and he is dangerous. He’s also an unmitigated dirtbag.   
In advance of Constitution Day, Campus Reform interviewed students at Georgetown University, many of whom suggested that the founding document should be eliminated or replaced because it is too old and “vague.” Several students expressed frustration over the extent to which the Constitution factors into political debates because it includes limitations on the powers of government. Friday is Constitution Day, so Campus Reform stopped by Georgetown University to speak with students about their opinions of the document upon which our nation was founded. When asked about the modern relevance of the Constitution, most students made their opinion clear: the Constitution isn’t something to take too seriously. “People definitely take it too seriously, it’s not 250 years ago,” one student complained. “It’s maybe not as important as it was when it was written… times have obviously changed,” concurred another. Echoing the sentiment that the Constitution has lost relevance with age, another student observed that “when it was written, it was vague and using language we don’t really use anymore…” Still another student opined that the document actually limits our nation’s… Please go to Campus Reform to read the rest of the story and watch the VIDEO…  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.
A former mayor in the State of Ohio has admitted to raping and molesting a little girl over a three year period, beginning when she was just 4 years old. However, what is more disturbing is the fact that he claims the child was a “willing participant” and initiated the acts. Richard Keenan, a former Hubbard mayor, admitted to the crimes, according to the Trumbull County Prosecutor’s Office. Vindy.com reports: Keenan, who served as Hubbard mayor in 2010 and 2011, was indicted last month on eight counts of rape and 12 counts of attempted rape and gross sexual imposition. A rape conviction carries a sentence of life in prison. According to the filing by Assistant Prosecutor Gabriel Wildman, Keenan, 65, made the admissions to his wife, a pastor, a social worker and his brother and sister-in-law. Wildman’s filing states that when Keenan’s wife, Diana, heard about the assaults from the child, “upon confronting [her husband] about the allegations, [Keenan] responded, ‘I did it.'” The filing states Keenan also admitted sexual abuse during “group discussions” while he was in the ValleyCare Trumbull Memorial Hospital psychiatric ward. Keenan also had “in depth” conversations with his pastor in which he spoke of the molestation and rape. Mr. Keenan was also feeling suicidal because he had been abusing the child, according to a social worker from the Warren psychiatric facility, which he voluntarily admitted himself. He also said that the child initiated the act and even referred to her as a “willing participant.” Now, questions are being raised as to whether or not his wife and pastor are able to testify against him. The Ohio Rules of Evidence state that a spouse is considered “competent to be a witness if the testifying spouse elects to testify.” Additionally, the Ohio Revised Coder says that the pastor cannot be compelled to testify if “the confession or confidential communication was made directly to the cleric.” Keenan was indicted in August on eight counts of rape and twelve counts of attempted rape and gross sexual imposition. He is free on $75,000 bond. If convicted, he faces life in prison. His trial is scheduled to be held prior to April 24, 2017. I have to ask, what need is there for a trial? Has the man not confessed to the crime? It is a waste of time and money. Furthermore, what is with sentencing a man to life in prison? Will his young victim not grow up to pay taxes to support food, clothing and housing for her rapist? What is just about that? We need a return to the Biblical model of law and justice, a model our forefathers followed.

Roughly a half dozen Wells Fargo workers who tried doing the right thing about the bank’s scamming of customers were summarily fired. During his grilling in Washington earlier this week, Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf testified that it was company policy to enable whistleblowers to speak out against unethical and fraudulent behavior at the bank. “Each team member, no matter where you are in the organization, is encouraged to raise their hands,” Stumpf said. However, Bill Bado, a former Wells Fargo banker in Pennsylvania, claims he had a different experience. Bado was given orders from his supervisors in September 2013 to enroll customers in phony accounts without their knowledge or consent. Bado not only refused, he called the company’s ethics hotline and contacted the bank’s human resources hotline to inform them of the scam. After Bado was let go, the bank’s official reason for his firing was “tardiness.” “I told them that’s not only unethical but illegal,” Bado told CNN Money. “They ruined my life.” A Wells Fargo human resources worker — who elected to remain anonymous to protect their career — also told CNN Money that the corporate headquarters put policies in place that were utilized to take revenge against whistleblowers, like firing them on the spot for showing up two minutes late. Former SEC chairman Harvey Pitt said that previous financial reform legislation, like the Dodd-Frank Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act codified protections for workers calling out illegal behavior at financial institutions. “It is clearly against the law for any company (or executives of such companies) to try to suppress whistleblowing,” Pitt told CNNMoney in an email. In early September, Heather Brock was fired from her position as a senior business banker at a Wells Fargo branch in Round Rock, Texas after she spoke up about the dubious sales practices she was asked to carry out. Brock said she endured textbook workplace harassment before eventually being fired. Sabrina Bertrand, who used to work for Wells Fargo in Houston, described pressure from her superiors to open the scam accounts was “unbearable.” “I endured harsh bullying … defamation of character, and eventually being pinned for something I didn’t do,”Brock told CNN Money. “I had managers in my face yelling at me,” Bertrand said. “They wanted you to open up dual checking accounts for people that couldn’t even manage their original checking account.” Wells Fargo was recently fined $185 million by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for perpetuating an elaborate scam of opening credit card and checking accounts on behalf of customers who never signed off on them in order to drive sales numbers higher. While 5,300 low-level and mid-tier employees were let go after the scam was exposed, no senior management or compliance officials have been fired as of this writing, and CEO John Stumpf has not yet stepped down.        
A University of Houston professor agreed to distribute “emotional first-aid kits” to students, apparently not realizing it was a satirical ploy by James O’Keefe. The emotional first-aid kits contain a baby blanket, chocolates, a plush kitten, a bag containing the smell of lavender, ear plugs, a genderless pastel teddy bear, hand written notes, and a pacifier. Prof. Schindler did, however, express reservations about the pacifiers, which she feared might be taken the wrong way, and suggested advising students to suck their thumbs instead. An assistant professor at the University of Houston recently agreed to distribute “emotional first-aid kits” to students, apparently not realizing it was a satirical ploy by James O’Keefe. O’Keefe, who is undercover in the Project Veritas video, claims he is a member of the “99.9 percent,” a group created for students who are “emotionally disturbed by opinions which differ from their own.” His correspondent, Philosophy department advisor Bobbie Sue Schindler, agreed without hesitation to the idea of “emotional first-aid kits,” even offering her assistance to help assemble them. “The stress of school gets to them,” Schindler observed to O’Keefe regarding the emotional distress that students face, “like a bad grade, a missed class, being late, a microaggression, uh whatever…” To help students deal with such burdens, the emotional first-aid kits contain a baby blanket, chocolates, a plush kitten, a bag containing the smell of lavender, ear plugs, a genderless pastel teddy bear, hand written notes, and a pacifier. Only the pacifier gave Schindler any pause, though only out of concern that students might take them the wrong way. Instead, she suggested that the kit just contain a note encouraging students to suck their thumbs… Read the rest of the story and watch the hidden cam VIDEO at Campus Reform  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.
Here we go again. Cop shoots thug, Black Lives Matter morons riot, cause mass destruction, and cause harm to businesses and people. This is the world we live in, folks,and it’s happening in front of our very eyes…again. And nowhere to be found is our do-nothing president who consistently sides with all the rioters. He couldn’t care less as his racially charged agenda is to divide the US so much that we’re sent back to the civil right movement. Or so it would seem. New Gingrich just called out BLM and Obama for this decay of race relations. It’s put square on their shoulders and we agree with him! Watch below.  “Fifty-three years after Martin Luther King’s ‘I Have A Dream’ speech; eight years after the election of an African-American president…race relations are decaying in this country.” “Schools that don’t work, neighborhoods with no jobs, random violence, a sense of being powerless even though there is an African-American president,” Gingrich said. But there’s another problem here. Whenever there is a riot, Obama speaks out in favor of BLM saying that we need to reform our police and they need to take more responsibility for their actions. However, when countless thousands are killed in inner city black on black crime across the country, specifically in Chicago, Obama’s hometown, he doesn’t bat an eye. Because it doesn’t fit his agenda. He lamented the fact that major Democratic leaders have not intently reacted to repeated events of anti-police protests and urban violence. “Over 3,000 people shot in Chicago…but no national reaction: Obama doesn’t notice it, Clinton doesn’t notice it.” “The country at large will not tolerate this kind of random violence. People will not tolerate looting…closing Interstate 85– burning things.” What we need is someone who can restore order to things. This must end. Police must be vigilant and arrest anyone who riots. We need a president who can stop all this, not Obama who only ads fuel to the quite literal fires. Read more here… 
Voters want to know what happened with Hillary Clinton and her e-mails. And the issue won’t go away… partly because officials keep doing all they can to cover for Hillary and make sure she avoids prosecution. They’re dragging it out and trying to block people from seeing her e-mails. They want to make sure that people vote before they can see them… and thanks to one judge, that effort is now a success.   A federal judge just ruled that her e-mails won’t be released to the public until after election day. The FBI recovered a number of e-mails during their investigation into her server scandal, but the majority of them will remain secret for the time being. Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton is pointing the finger squarely at the Obama administration, blaming them for the delay in releasing the content of the e-mails. “This is an absolutely corrupt process the State Department has come up with,” he said. So, what is in these e-mails that is making so many people in the Obama administration work so hard to keep them hidden? She must have some pretty scandalous and controversial stuff in there that could ruin her chances of winning. And Obama has already declared Hillary as his successor, so he is clearly not going to let her campaign go down in flames.   Hillary Clinton is one of the most corrupt politicians in existence. Most people know that already. But what is so worrying here is that she is evidently able to control both the FBI and the Department of Justice to keep herself out of jail, along with God knows how many federal judges. At this point, why even bother pretending that she’s held to the same laws as the rest of us puny citizens? And as if this all wasn’t bad enough, there are people who want to vote for her… so that she can become president and have even more power and influence than she already does. How crooked and criminal does Hillary need to be before these people wake up and realize what a catastrophe she is?   
Trump repeated tonight one of his favorite fear-mongering lies: that crime is dangerously out of control in American cities. Specifically, he cited Chicago – which he emphasized is “Obama’s hometown” – as an example of a place plagued by out of control crime. In reality, however, crime rates in all categories have been consistently declining over the past decade and a half – albeit with a recent almost statistically insignificant spike in murder in some select cities. As for Chicago, crime – both violent and otherwise – has been consistently declining since about 2001. There has indeed been a spike in homicides over the past few years, but even this year’s exceptional murder count will not exceed the almost 700 murders tallied in the early Bush years, much less the almost one thousand annual murders in the 1990s. In fact, the annual murder and violent crime rate in Chicago under President Obama has been lower than any other time in decades.  The decrease in crime in Chicago corresponds with nationwide trends. Since the 1990s violent crime in all areas and all categories has declined tremendously. There has indeed been a recent uptick in murders in a few cities but the overall trend remains incontrovertible downward. That’s just the facts. These facts, however, don’t sit well with a demagogic fearmonger like Donald Trump, who relies on fear and hatred to mobilize his support. In the midst of tonight’s debate Trump even deployed the archetypal line of the dictator-to-be: “we need law and order.” And Trump is not going to let the facts get in the way of his delusional plots. 
All the excitement about the 2016 presidential election isnât limited to the U.S. alone. Media from around the globe are covering this race, too. And just like U.S. media, so too is foreign press particularly keeping a watchful eye on â you guessed it â Republican frontrunner Donald Trump. Heâs been a hot topic in international articles, editorials and broadcasts, and which pertain to everything from his bizarre and xenophobic statements to the violence at his campaign events. One particularly effective way that foreign media have been able to express their opinions on The Donald is through political cartoons. Those editorials of art can capture a lot more public attention, and often with a lot more punch. Like these 12 in particular (first collected byÂ Politico): By Christo Komarnitski  byÂ Petar Pismestrovic ofÂ Kleine Zeitung Â   ByÂ Micheal De Adder of the Halifax Chronicle Herald By Paresh Nath of The Khaleej Times This one isnât against Trump alone, though. See what appears to be Hillary Clinton on the left? The cartoon insinuates that Trump is in the race just to make sure Clinton has an easy win in November. The phraseÂ translates word-for-word to âToward an eclipse of the moonâ â or âToward a lunar eclipse.â It seems to refer toÂ legends about lunar eclipsesÂ (or âblood moonsâ) being bad luck, and how (at least) one culture would try to avoid that bad luck. In ancient Mesopotamia, a lunar eclipse was believed to indicate seven demons were coming to Earth to attack a king. In response, one commoner would falsely pose as the king â a body double who would take the harm in case the demons attacked. (And when the lunar eclipse was over, the pretend king would be killed.) In other words, then, this one implies that Trump is in the race only as a pretend candidate who could get Republican Party nomination, but who will only fall to Clinton in the general election.

While most assuredly Obama, Hillary and other Democrat politicians struggle to find a “motive” for a man to stab eight people in a Minnesota shopping mall on Saturday evening, the Associated Press (AP) is reporting that ISIS-linked media is claiming that the evil animal doing the stabbing was a “soldier of the Islamic State.” So, they’re saying that it wasn’t “workplace violence?” BREAKING: IS-linked media claims Minnesota mall stabber was 'soldier of the Islamic State.' — The Associated Press (@AP) September 18, 2016  In other words, “RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM.” Say it Hillary! Say it Obama! Say it! Moreover, the knife attacker referenced “Allah” during the attack and asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before assaulting, via a report from KSTP, the local ABC affiliate in the Twin Cities.

Things got very rowdy on CNN, with the guests unable to control their passions for the subject at hand. It got so out of control that it forced host Alisyn Camerota to pull the plug on her guests. Somehow, to no one’s surprise, Donald Trump’s name got dragged into the argument. See the video and read the article.  As Written By Christian Daytok for Daily Caller: Cleveland’s Pastor James Davis and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed yelled at each other for more than a minute straight on CNN’s Thursday broadcast of “New Day,” forcing host Alisyn Camerota to pull the plug on the segment. The two guests had been brought on the panel to discuss ways to fix problems in the black community and how those goals would be achieved through the respective presidential candidates. “The bottom line is, we need school choice,” stated Davis. “We have to pull the education system and put it back in the neighborhood and get it out of these unions’ hands, and the rest of it, because at the end of the day, irrespective of the numbers, it’s too slow. It’s not enough. It’s too little, too late.” “You finally get the down trend and then the president goes out and has his victory, takes this victory lap over $250 increase in monthly income for the last eight years when inflation pretty much ate that in full, and so now we sit here with saying that mediocrity is wonderful,” he added. “We can’t bring this administration into…… Full Story Here: CNN New Day Panel Turns Into Verbal Pissing-Contest, Video | The Daily Caller
A powerful exchange between a veteran and a police officer in riot gear at the scene of the Charlotte riots is spreading like wildfire on social media. In the video, the veteran, whose name has not been revealed as of this writing, is seen talking directly to an officer with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department (CMPD) policing the ongoing protests at the scene of Keith Lamont Scott’s death. The officer, who is clad in body armor and wearing a face shield, is refusing to look the veteran in the eyes. Throughout the video, the veteran emotionally conveys his love for his country, emphasizes his lack of hatred for police officers, and pleads with the officer to give him an answer as to how many times he’s supposed to ignore repeated instances of police killing black people. “I’m a veteran, bro. I love my country. I wouldn’t have it any other way,” the man is seen saying to the officer. “When I look at you, I don’t hate you, man! But how many times do you expect me to look the other way?” WHO IS THIS?? Raw emotion from Charlotte.#KeithLamontScott#TerenceCrutcher#BlackLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/6srQkT8W0e — Unstripped Voice (@UnstrippedVoice) September 21, 2016  Early Wednesday morning, riots broke out on Old Concord Road in Charlotte, North Carolina, as protests escalated into confrontations with police. Anger over the fatal shooting of 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott has reached a boiling point, with the CMPD reporting 12 officers injured as a result of the riots, and police firing tear gas on protesters.

They stress that the police’s account of events alleging Scott having a gun are patently false.

After Scott exited the vehicle with an object in his hand, Trietley said officers perceived the situation as life-threatening and opened fire. “The subject got back out of the vehicle armed with a firearm and posed an imminent deadly threat to the officers who subsequently fired their weapon striking the subject,” Trietley said. According to MappingPoliceViolence.org, Keith Lamont Scott is the 214th black person to be killed by police in 2016. Officer Brentley Vinson, the officer who killed Scott, has been placed on paid administrative leave in the wake of the shooting.        
via Allen West: When tragic mass attacks occur, the media generally focuses on the attacker, making the victims anonymous factors in the body count. Can you name one victim of the Orlando Pulse Nightclub attack? No of course not, but you surely know the killer. The attacker in the St. Cloud Mall this weekend has been identified as a 22-year-old Somali man and “solider of ISIS.” But let’s ignore him for a moment and focus on the hero who brought him down – because you can be quite certain the liberal media doesn’t want you to know ANYthing about him. His name is Jason Falconer, an off-duty police officer and firearms instructor who owns a gun range. Falconer happened to be at the mall when the terrorist began carrying out his attack. The Sun says, Falconer opened fire as the suspect lunged towards him. He got up and continued his terrifying assault each time he was shot until he was eventually fatally wounded. Morning News USA reports, “His (Falconer’s) goal is to teach individuals the mindset, knowledge and skills needed to be successful with firearms in order to secure their personal safety or that of their family, at home or in public,” said Tactical Advantage, the off-duty police officer’s company website.  Falconer told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that he’s “been trying to stay away from it all, for the time being.” He told the newspaper he wasn’t hurt and declined to talk further, citing the ongoing investigation for not saying more. Well, we’d like to give Officer Falconer a really big shout-out and thanks. He’s once again proven the best way to stop a bad guy with a knife is a good guy with a GUN. This isn’t the ending liberals want to the story. They also don’t want you to know the attacker was asking victims if they were Muslims before stabbing them. And they certainly don’t want to know an armed citizen was the one who stopped further horror. Facts are nasty things. [Note: This article was written by Michele Hickford] 
What a racist asshat this president is. He just came out and spoke on the Charlotte riots and it was exactly what I expected… lame and in support of violent radicals. He says the majority of people protesting are doing it the right way, if you can believe it. Is the right way killing fellow protesters? Is the right way looting and burning? Is the right way killing police officers across the nation? What a reprehensible statement and by the way, the exact opposite of what he said over the Baltimore riots. You don’t see these people doing the ‘wrong thing’ every once in a while. It’s rampant and getting increasingly worse, which is exactly what Obama wants. He’s now pandering to the Black Lives Matter, New Black Panthers, Nation of Islam devotees for Hillary Clinton. If he seems to condone their barbaric actions, he might win their votes… or so his twisted logic goes.  From Breitbart: President Barack Obama dismissed the recent violence and destruction in Charlotte, North Carolina by rioters reacting to the shooting of an armed African-American man by an African-American police officer. “The overwhelming majority of people who have been concerned about police-community relations [are] doing it the right way,” Obama said. “Every once in a while you see folks doing it the wrong way. Looting, breaking glass, those things are not going to advance the cause.” Obama made his comments during an interview with Good Morning America’s Robin Roberts at the brand new Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. He argued that Americans should recognize that there was a real problem in the justice system that the protestors in Charlotte were reacting to. “I think it’s important to separate out the pervasive sense of frustration among a lot of African Americans about shootings of people and the sense that justice is not always color blind,” he said. Obama didn’t condemn the violence or the murder at all. He didn’t support the police either. Big shocker there. He’s an absolute disgrace to the black community. He always has been. We were well on our way to being a colorblind society until Obama started dividing us. He’s a stone cold racist. It was a black cop who shot a black man there in North Carolina, but Obama managed to make it all about race in the end. Typical. He paid weak homage to being peaceful… but that is not what he means and he knows that is not what has and will happen in the streets of America. I guess the difference in North Carolina was that the area wasn’t ‘black’ enough and by wording things the way Obama did, he greenlighted further violence by Black Lives Matter and other radicals. But hey… vote for Hillary!  
It would not surprise me in the least if the moderators in tonight’s debate help Hillary Clinton. In fact, I would bet on it. However… Trump is no wallflower or wilting lily. If the moderators are unfair to him, he’s going to come out and challenge them. There won’t be political niceties here. He’s a scrapper. I may not support the man, but trust me, I think he will mop the stage with these limp Marxists. That’s his brand. Hillary may think she has it in the bag and that the moderators will protect her and correct Trump at every turn, but not so fast. Trump has an unsettling effect on people. He’s known for throwing them off balance. And he loves the limelight… you don’t think for a moment that he will let someone like Clinton upstage him, do you? Don’t be silly.  From Rasmussen Reports: Voters are pretty convinced the moderators at the presidential debates scheduled to begin tonight will be helping Hillary Clinton more than Donald Trump. A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that a plurality (46%) of Likely U.S. Voters believes most moderators will try to help Clinton in the upcoming debates. Only six percent (6%) think they will try to help Trump instead. Just 32% say most of the moderators will try to be unbiased, while 15% are undecided. (To see survey question wording, click here.) Seventy-eight percent (78%) of voters who support Trump think the moderators will try to help Clinton. Most Clinton supporters (56%) say the moderators will try to be unbiased, but 20% say they’ll try to help their candidate. Twelve percent (12%) of Clinton voters think the moderators will try to help Trump, compared to just two percent (2%) of Trump supporters who feel that way. Four years ago before the first debate between President Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney, 71% of Republicans and 56% of unaffiliated voters said debate moderators are biased, but Democrats by a 47% to 30% margin felt they were not biased. In 2008 before the first debate, 22% felt the first moderator, veteran PBS newsman Jim Lehrer, would try to help Obama, while six percent (6%) expected him to help GOP nominee John McCain. Forty-three percent (43%) though Lehrer would play a neutral role. This year’s debates are potentially a breakaway moment for either Clinton or Trump who have been running neck-and-neck for weeks in Rasmussen Reports’ White House Watch survey. Trump is ahead by five points in the latest survey, but it’s too early to say if he is gaining any traction over his rival. I consider everything out of both of their pieholes to be a lie, so I have no horse in this race. But, I am in it for the entertainment factor… sort of like eating popcorn during an apocalypse. Frankly, I think this is Trump’s to lose and I highly doubt he will. But I’m sure there are bookies out there laying odds on something going amiss with Clinton: a potty emergency, fainting spell, seizure, brain freeze, coughing fit… any of those and she is toast. Trump looks hale and hearty in comparison. This is the ultimate bread and circuses in America. Behold an election as reality TV. And Trump is known for saying, “You’re fired!” Clinton may very well exit the show stage left tonight.  
There is no law against burning the American flag. There is no law against stomping upon it either. However, that doesn’t mean that parents should have to accept a teacher teaching their kids to hate America.   Hatred for America and her history and values is all the rage these days amongst the left. Believing it to be chic and edgy, many liberals are apt to stomp upon the flag that greater Americans than they fought and died to defend. One history teacher at a public school stomped on the American flag to prove some kind of point and now, unsurprisingly, people are upset. A teacher on Monday at Massey Hill Classical High School in Fayetteville, North Carolina – home of Fort Bragg and America’s Special Forces – stomped on the flag to prove a point about the value of the First Amendment. The school district claims that they are investigating the incident. However, with teachers being fiercely guarded by union extortionists, it’s doubtful that this man will see any repercussions unless he dares to mention Christ. “What that teacher did was a gut punch to all the military kids at that school,” one parent said. “More so to the ones with deployed parents and unforgivably so to Gold Star kids who lost a parent who fought under that flag. It is indefensible.” “Clearly there are other ways to teach First Amendment rights without desecrating a flag,” the superintendent said. Students reported that the teacher had attempted to burn and tear the flag before stomping on it. Several students were upset and some walked out in protest of the disgrace. This man should not be thrown into a gulag, but let’s not pretend that teaching kids to hate America and her symbols of freedom is some kind of educational opportunity. Just another day in the far-left educational system…   
Donald Trump thinks African-Americans are worse off now than they have ever been, and President Obama just took him to the woodshed for it. During a rally, Trump declared that “African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape than they’ve ever been in before.” The assertion suggests that slavery was a picnic for black people and that Jim Crow was heaven on earth. But President Obama set Trump straight during an interview with Good Morning America at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. “You know, I think even most 8-year-olds’ll tell you that whole slavery thing wasn’t very good for black people,” Obama told Robin Roberts. “Jim Crow wasn’t very good for black people. What we have to do is use our history to propel us to make more progress in the future.” Here’s the video via ABC.  President Obama also slammed those who think racism no longer exists in this country simply because he was elected to the presidency or because some black people make a lot of money. “It’s unrealistic to think that somehow that all just completely went away, because the Civil Rights Act was passed or because Oprah’s making a lot of money or because I was elected president. You know, that’s not how society works. And if you have hundreds of years of racial discrimination it’s likely that the vestiges of that discrimination linger on. And we should acknowledge that and own that.” As President Obama said, Donald Trump could learn a lot from a visit to this museum. To think that black people had it easy as slaves is offensive and it’s almost as if Trump thinks they would be better off going back to being slaves. So he’s definitely on a slippery slope, and while that may get his white supremacist supporters frothing at the mouth, it does nothing to help him get black people to vote for him. 
Trey Gowdy really gets it on the refugee resettlement crisis in this country. And he’s not buying Obama’s lame excuse of protecting widows and orphans. He’s more concerned with the American widows and orphans that will result because of terrorists being imported among these refugees. With no real vetting going on, it is a certainty. Obama is deliberately and willfully bringing in Jihadists to this country and seeding them all over the nation… especially in conservative strongholds. It is not Islamophobic to point out bringing in an Islamic invasion force per the Hijrah Migration is deadly to the US. The Refugee Act of 1980 requires a hearing in both the House and Senate Judiciary Committees on the Presidential ‘determination’ on the number of refugees the President is proposing for the upcoming fiscal year — in advance of the fiscal year. That hearing is due in one week and is extremely unlikely to take place. Obama is making an absolute joke of our laws and Constitution. He started out saying there would be 10,000 refugees. At the time I said it would be 250,000. Now he says it will be 110,000 and last week his minions claimed it would go to 217,000. I hate it when I’m right. From TellMeNow: Trey Gowdy is a champion for everyday Americans. While speaking about the Syrian refugee crisis, Gowdy offered a prosecutorial assessment of President Obama’s mishandling of the situation. Gowdy pointed out that the president shuts down any debate about this topic by slandering those concerned about national security. He likes to paint us as Islamophobic, but it is the president’s own staff that has raised red flags on this topic. This isn’t just about saving widows and orphans as Obama states. There are terrorists hiding among those widows and orphans. Gowdy summed up my position perfectly when he said, “What I’m really afraid of is a foreign policy that creates more widows and orphans.” Senator Jeff Sessions scheduled a hearing that the Obama State Department refused to attend over the refugee crisis. Gowdy is ringing some alarm bells here, but he has so far not scheduled any meetings to tackle the issue. Just a meeting to discuss how New Orleans became a Sanctuary City. 20,000 to 30,000 Syrian refugees are slated to arrive in the US next weekend… I think that matter is a bit more pressing at the moment. So, by all means… shred Obama on the refugee nightmare. But Gowdy should carry through and address the issue for real in the House. The only real thing on the calendar before these guys leave for the holidays is the budget continuation. Gowdy is exactly right that the refugees from Syria (and other Islamic countries) pose a horrific national security threat. But for God’s sake, let’s go after it for real before we truly do become an Islamic nation. This is why so many are turning to Donald Trump and voting for him. The more of this that goes down, the more likely Trump is to be the next Commander-in-Chief.

With this presidential election being as absolutely bizarre as it is, sometimes itâs incredibly important to keep our sense of humor about us. One person who seems to being doing this very well is none other than Dixie Chicksâ Natalie Maines. As a woman whoâs never shied away from letting her opinion be known about politicians, Maines began by taking to Twitter to make a joke about her apparent issues with airline travel saying that sheâll vote for whoever makes the airline industry decent again. Although, she had one quick addendum to that statement: âBut only if itâs a Clinton.â At this point I might vote for whichever candidate promises to make the airline industry decent again. But only if it's Clintonð. â Natalie Maines (@1NatalieMaines) September 22, 2016  Then Maines went on to joke about the fact that not even George H.W. Bush can vote for Trump for president. Which for a Bush not to vote for a bad president to be in office is just utter irony. Even Bush won't vote for Trump! Which honestly has kind of turned my world around and forced me to rethink everything.#skiddin â Natalie Maines (@1NatalieMaines) September 22, 2016  She didnât stop there, however, in reply after reply, the jokes kept coming: @giannaL Oh no! Not at all! It's totally natural. For an Umpa Lumpa. â Natalie Maines (@1NatalieMaines) September 22, 2016  @DCXn24Fan OMG! That's even a better visual than him in a tanning bed. So presidential! â Natalie Maines (@1NatalieMaines) September 22, 2016  @mysheltieestate @hochalicious Actually it's also hands. And he has little ones. â Natalie Maines (@1NatalieMaines) September 22, 2016  @DarthPug Let's hope they forget to register. â Natalie Maines (@1NatalieMaines) September 22, 2016  And those are just a few of the replies. Maines was clearly on Twitter and ready to strike back at anyone or anything (if weâre talking about Trump supporters) that decided to reply to her tweets against him. And honestly, weâre all a little better for her wit and wisdom during this most troubling time. 
First a pipe bomb exploded on the Jersey Shore, then New York was next. Now, pipe bombs have been found in a New Jersey train station. According to the New York Daily News, “authorities discovered three pipe bombs and two smaller devices at a train station in Elizabeth.”   NEW JERSEY: Elizabeth Mayor says a bag with wires and pipes was found in a trash can near NJT Station, FBI on scene. https://t.co/q60LGGS52o — KolHaolam (@KolHaolam) September 19, 2016   Since all of these bombs have been found in a relatively small area, it seems likely that a small team or even a single individual is behind it. Although Islamic terrorism would seem to be the most likely explanation, there have been “mad bombers” who’ve done this sort of thing before (See Ted Kaczynski & George Metesky). Is their motive simply to cause terror? Are they trying to create mass casualties, but failing to do so? We don’t know yet. However, the FBI has arrested 5 people they believe may be connected to the Chelsea bombing investigation. That being said, none of these people have been charged, which could mean they’re collecting evidence or alternately, these people may end up having nothing to do with the case.  Goodnight!

While Donald Trump Jr., Executive Vice President of the Trump Organization, compares refugees to poisoned skittles, the CEOs, Presidents and other executives of 51 companies are coming together to pledge hundreds of millions of dollars to aid refugees all across the world, the White House has announced. Coming together to show solidarity and compassion while world leaders meet for the U.N. General Assembly session, the companies â which include Matercard, Facebook, Twitter, Johnson & Johnson, and yogurt maker Chobani â will use the money to promote, sustain and continue education, employment and financial services all across the world, and alleviate suffering to over 6 million refugees: Today, 51 U.S. companies â whichÂ representÂ more than 2.5 million employees, more than $775 billion in annual revenue, and more than $3.2 trillion in market capitalization âÂ have stepped up andÂ are standing with the Administration to demonstrate that private sector innovation and resources can make a difference andÂ catalyze real solutions. Together,Â they have committed toÂ investing, donating, andÂ raising more than $650 million. The hefty pledge is just part of the White Houseâs goal of $3 billion in humanitarian aid, and the announcement was made just as President Obama hosted a refugee summitÂ with the leaders of Jordan, Mexico, Sweden, Germany, Canada and Ethiopia, countries that have taken in thousands of refugees from Syria and other war-torn states. While meeting with the company CEOs and George Clooney, President Obama thanked them for their âextraordinary gesture of compassion,â saying: âI want to emphasize that from their perspective this isnât charity. This is part of their overall mission. It makes good business sense.â Unlike Trumpâs businesses â in which hotel stays have plummeted â people like to be compassionate, see compassion, and act on it. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told world leaders and the company leaders, âYour compassion will really help these helpless people. If not us, who can do it?â Certainly not Donald J. Trump, nor his spawn of selfish fear-mongers. The companies took to social media to express their support for President Obamaâs call to action: We believe in a world where you can #BelongAnywhere. Today there are millions of displaced refugees in need of belonging somewhere. â Airbnb (@Airbnb) September 19, 2016  #Citi is proud to support President Obamaâs Call for Action to help solve the global #refugee crisis. https://t.co/nFRqb9SZor â Citi (@Citi) September 20, 2016  Mastercard & @mercycorps partner to provide #refugee aid at the most critical times https://t.co/rkpkO68T5V #UNGA pic.twitter.com/GdvPp10CvH â Mastercard News (@MastercardNews) September 15, 2016  Weâre proud our little start up is standing w/ @facebook @LinkedIn @Citi & other businesses in support of #refugees https://t.co/GjN6RkTamK â Alight Fund (@alightfund) September 20, 2016  If there is anything President Obama and these companies have shown, itâs that compassion will always win, and love always trumps hate. 
Donald Trump has again made a huge mistake while referring to life experienced by many black Americans every day. The screw-up in question came as Trump seriously argued that the lives of blacks today are worse than they were during slavery and in the Jim Crow segregation era.  Speaking at a rally in Kenansville, North Carolina, Trump again stumbled in an apparent attempt to endear himself to black voters. âWeâre going to make our country safe again. Weâre going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape that theyâve ever been in before,â he said. âEver, ever, ever.â The comment, made in a city named for a slave owner, is objectively untrue, and completely ignores that black people were once subjected to slavery and Jim Crow laws. While the media has largely viewed Trumpâs weird racial comments as a sign that he is âreaching outâ to black voters, polls have actually shown that he is poised to do worse with that group than Mitt Romney or John McCain. Black voters have had an inherent distrust of Trump, which has been amplified thanks to his promotion of the racist âbirtherâ conspiracy there for years.Trump also called for the death penalty for the Central Park 5, long after it had been proven that the young black men involved with the case had been proven innocent. Lately, Trump has argued that the black community in America is a desperate, infantile mess, relying on government welfare in order to simply get by. The image Trump has been spreading has not been for black audiences, but instead have been targeted to a conservative base, high on the idea that ethnic minorities always have their hands out. Black voters have found Trumpâs description of them insulting, particularly coming as the community has made huge strides forward. 
I love Texas! I mean I really love their attitude. They are like the honey badger, they just don’t give a damn about what everyone else thinks. Governor Abbott is the quintessential Texan because he stands up and defends the citizens of his state EVEN if it means spitting in the face of Barack Obama.   Governor Abbott told Obama on Wednesday that Texas would no longer participate in his current refugee program because of the massive security concerns. Abbott has a right to be concerned since we had 4+ terrorist attacks over the weekend in the United States. Abbott doesn’t want to take chances that the hardly screened refugees settling in his state would have terroristic ideals. The Texas State Refugee Coordinator gave their 120 days notice of their intention to withdraw. The Office of Refugee Resettlement said in a statement its services to help integrate newcomers into U.S. society are only provided after they complete stringent US security screenings. Currently the US Refugee Settlement Processing protocol is riddled with security holes and has already let dozens of extremist refugees into the US. “The federal government’s refugee settlement program is riddled with serious problems that pose a threat to our nation,” the governor said in a statement. “The director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the director of national intelligence have repeatedly declared their inability to fully screen refugees from terrorist-based nations. Even with the inability to properly vet refugees from Syria and countries known to be supporters or propagators of terrorism, President Obama is now ineptly proposing a dramatic increase in the number of refugees to be resettled in the U.S.” “While many refugees pose no danger, some pose grave danger, like the Iraqi refugee with ties to ISIS who was arrested earlier this year after he plotted to set off bombs at two malls in Houston,” Abbott said. “Despite multiple requests by the state of Texas, the federal government lacks the capability or the will to distinguish the dangerous from the harmless, and Texas will not be an accomplice to such dereliction of duty to the American people,” he added. “Therefore, Texas will withdraw from the refugee resettlement program. I strongly urge the federal government to completely overhaul a broken and flawed refugee program that increasingly risks American lives.” So take THAT Mr. President!   
It’s true that conservatives have a tendency to take the opinions of reality stars with many grains of salt, especially because they have a tendency to be mindlessly liberal and ill-informed. Brody Jenner, however, has said something worth sharing. Brody is the son of Caitlyn (then Bruce) Jenner and actress Linda Thompson, and stars in “The Hills,” a show that I’ve never seen and for which I can give you no description.   Twitter exploded after Brody Jenner posted a comment on Instagram claiming that not everything is about race. Of course, adding “All Lives Matter” was pretty much the end of it. The perpetually-offended crowd took to their keyboards to let him know that he’s a terrible person because he’s white and a man, and straight and “cis-gender.” Below is the offending post: “I normally don’t speak about this type of stuff, but this is just ridiculous. I can’t even watch the news anymore without getting pissed off. This has nothing to do with race. White, black, brown, any color…if you have an officer of the law telling you to exit your vehicle (or do anything for that matter)…you comply. And not only do you comply, but you do so willingly and follow directions completely. And why in the world would you exit that vehicle with a weapon in hand (allegedly?!) That makes no sense! And if, let’s just say, you DON’T have a gun, why would you not put your hands up in the air and state “I do not have a gun” so that the officers can clearly see that you don’t??” After receiving backlash, he posted another photo on Instagram, salting the wounds of the whining babies on the left.  Predictably, liberals lost their ever-loving minds over this, but it’s honestly just par for the course with these people. They are always looking for something by which they can be offended. 
Donald Trump spent Monday night making a total ass out of himself in the first presidential debate. We were all waiting to see just what would happen tonight, and it was quite the spectacle. From lies to self-incrimination, watching the GOP nomineeâs performance was the equivalentÂ of one facepalm after another. So here you go, aÂ complete listÂ of every batshit crazy thing that came out of Donald Trumpâs mouth during the first presidential debate: âThereâs nobody in our government to fight them [China], and we have a very good fight, and we have a winning fight.â Â  âTheyâre using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China and many other countries are doing the same thing.â Â  âWe have to stop these countries from stealing our companies.â Â  âOur countryâs in deep trouble. Â We donât know what weâre doing with devaluationsâ¦ Especially when it comes to China, theyâre the best. Â Theyâre the best ever at it. What theyâre doing to us is a very very sad thing.â Â  âThatâs called business, by the way.â (referring to making money off of the 2007 financial collapse) Â  âIâm a great believer in all forms of energyâ¦ Our country is losing a so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt.â Â  âI will bring back jobs. Â You canât bring back jobs.â Â  âThatâs about all youâve got.â (referring to Clintonâs book We Are Stronger Together) Â  âYou are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history. Â You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. Â You are going to drive businesses out.â Â  âIâm going to cut taxes, big-league. Â You are going to raise taxes, big-league.â Â  âAnd take a look at mine also.â (referring to his campaign website) Â  âShe tells us how to fight ISIS on her website. Â I donât think Douglas MacArthur would like that too muchâ¦ Youâre telling the enemy everything you want to do. Â No wonder youâve been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.â Â  âWell, Iâm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going to create tremendous jobs. Â Theyâre going to expand their companies. Â Theyâre going to do a tremendous job.â (hahahaha) Â  âIâm getting rid of the carried interest provision, and if you really look, itâs really not a great thing for the wealthy, itâs really a great thing for middle class.â (methinks thou dost protest too much) Â  âThese people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies. Â And when theyâre going to bring 2.5 trillion dollars back from overseas, where they canât bring the money back because politicians like Secretary Clinton wonât allow them to bring the money back because the taxes are so onerous and the bureaucratic red tape is so bad.â (or because those companies are greedy and un-American, just saying) Â  âSo, what theyâre doing is leaving our country, and believe it or not, theyâre leaving our country because the taxes are too high. Â Because some of them companies have lots of money outside our country, and instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work because they canât work out a deal. Â And everybody agrees it should be brought back, instead of that theyâre leaving our country to get their money because they canât bring their money back into our country, because of bureacratic red tape. Â Because they canât get together, because we have a President that canât sit them around a table, and get them to approve something.â Â (maybe companies should just pay their taxes so we donât need to cut valuable public services) Â  âWe have no leadership, and honestly, that starts with Secretary Clintonâ¦ Why not [blame Clinton for everything]?â Â  âWeâre in a bubble right now, and the only thing that looks good is the stock market.â Â  âWe have a FED that is doing political thingsâ¦ the FED is being more political than Secretary Clintonâ Â  âWhen we have a country thatâs doing so badly, thatâs being ripped off by every single country in the world, itâs the kind of thinking that our country needs.â Â  âWe have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.â (in response to a question about his taxes) Â  âIâve been under audit for almost 15 years. Â I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited. Â I say, âHave you been audited?â Â I get audited almost every year, and in a way I should be complaining. Â Iâm not even complaining. Â I donât mind it. Â Itâs almost become a way of life. Â I get audited by the IRS, but other people donât.â Â  âWe have a situation in this country that needs to be taken care of. Â I will release my tax returns against my lawyers wishesâ¦â Â  âThat makes me smart.â (in response to paying zero dollars in federal income taxes) Â  âI could give you a list of banks, if that would help you. Â I would give you a list of banks. Â These are very fine institutions, very fine banks. Â I could do that very quickly.â Â  âI have a tremendous income. Â The reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way.â Â  âItâs about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.â Â  âOur airports are like from a third world countryâ¦ Weâve become a third world country. Â The worst of all things has happened.â Â  âAnd itâs really a shame. And itâs politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. Weâre a debtor nation. Weâre a serious debtor nation. And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we donât have the money, because itâs been squandered on so many of your ideas.â Â  âIt would be squandered, too, believe me.â (in response to not paying any federal income taxes) Â  âMaybe he didnât do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his workâ¦ Which our country should do, too.â (referring to not paying people who worked for him) âBut on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didnât get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation. Â Now, if you want to change the laws, youâve been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because Iâm running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And thatâs what I do.â (referring to bankrupting four companies and not paying his business debts) âBut what she doesnât say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me. Iâll give you an example. Weâre just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I donât get there one way, Iâm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.â Â  âWhen we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy.â Â  âWell, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesnât want to use a couple of words, and thatâs law and order. And we need law and order. If we donât have it, weâre not going to have a country.â Â  âNow, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York.â Â  âWe have to be â we have to know what weâre doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything.â Â  âNo, youâre wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where itâs allowed.â (referring to racial profiling becoming outlawed as unconstitutional) Â  âWe need law and order. And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by whatâs happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And itâs very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.â Â  âI have the endorsement of the NRA, which Iâm very proud of. These are very, very good people.â Â  âBut I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldnât be on there, weâll help them, weâll help them legally, weâll help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.â Â  âBut stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact.â Â  âTheyâve been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because thatâs what it is. Theyâve controlled these communities for up to 100 years.â Â  âYou know, youâve seen me, Iâve been all over the place. You decided to stay home, and thatâs OK. But I will tell you, Iâve been all over. And Iâve met some of the greatest people Iâll ever meet within these communities.â Â  âWhen I got involved, I didnât fail. I got him to give the birth certificate. So Iâm satisfied with it. And Iâll tell you why Iâm satisfied with itâ¦Â But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. And I think I did a good jobâ¦Â Well, it was very â I say nothing. I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing.â Â  âBut let me just tell you. When you talk about healing, I think that Iâve developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community. I think you can see that. Â And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusionâ Â  âAnd I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.â Â  âFirst of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect. Â And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. It doesnât work that way. You were after him.â Â  âNow, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my fatherâs company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country â it was a federal lawsuit â were sued. We settled the suit with zero â with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do.â Â  âAnd, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I donât do on you. Maybe Iâm trying to save the money.â Â  âBut, frankly, I look â I look at that, and I say, isnât that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and itâs just one of those things.â Â  âIâll go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And itâs a tremendously successful club. And Iâm so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did. And Iâm very, very proud of it. And thatâs the way I feel. That is the true way I feel.â Â  âIn addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. Theyâve never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE.â Â  âAs far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps weâre not. I donât think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. Sheâs saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I donât â maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?â Â  âNow, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we donât know, because the truth is, under President Obama weâve lost control of things that we used to have control over.â Â  âWe came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, theyâre beating us at our own game. ISIS.â Â  âSo we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is â it is a huge problem. I have a son. Heâs 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, itâs unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe itâs hardly doable.â Â  âBut I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But thatâs true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do betterâ¦Â and certainly cyber is one of them.â Â  âSo she talks about taking them out. Sheâs been doing it a long time. Sheâs been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldnât have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldnât have had them.â (speaking about the creation of ISIS) Â  âOr, as Iâve been saying for a long time, and I think youâll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil â and we should have taken the oil â ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil â a lot of the oil in Libya.â Â  âWrongâ¦ Wrong. Â Wrong.â Â  âThe secretary said very strongly about working with â weâve been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyoneâs ever seen.â Â  âBut you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, thatâs another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly. They were choking on the sanctions. And now theyâre going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way theyâre going.â Â  âNumber one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them arenât paying their fair share. Number two â and that bothers me, because we should be asking â weâre defending them, and they should at least be paying us what theyâre supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.â Â  âAnd, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because â and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest â but I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times.â Â  âAnd about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think thatâs great. And I think we should get â because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. Itâs a lot of money to protect other people. But Iâm all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also. Â And theyâre going to do that. And that was â believe me â Iâm sure Iâm not going to get credit for it â but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.â Â  âAnd believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. Not only that, you named the day. They couldnât believe it. They sat back probably and said, I canât believe it.â Â  âBut you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant. Now itâs in over 30 countries. And youâre going to stop them? I donât think so.â Â  âThat is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she â frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.â Â  âWell, I have much better judgment than she does. Thereâs no question about that. I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?â Â  âI have a much better â she spent â let me tell you â she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising â you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names â oh, temperament, letâs go after â I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament. I have a winning temperament. I know how to win. She does not have aâ¦â Â  âWait. The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I donât know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control. I said, thereâs a person with a temperament thatâs got a problem.â Â  âWrongâ¦ Itâs liesâ¦Â That lineâs getting a little bit old, I must say. I would like toâ¦Â Itâs not an accurate one at all. Itâs not an accurate one. So I just want to give a lot of things â and just to respond.â Â  âI agree with her on one thing. The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your â your president thinks. Â Nuclear is the single greatest threat.â Â  âJust to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries. They do not pay us. But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and weâre losing a fortune. Thatâs why weâre losing â weâre losing â we lose on everything. I say, who makes these â we lose on everything.â Â  âAll I said, that itâs very possible that if they donât pay a fair share, because this isnât 40 years ago where we could do what weâre doing. We canât defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million.â Â  âAll I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out. Weâre a country that owes $20 trillion. They have to help us out.â Â  âWell, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, sheâs very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding their â they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint.â Â  âWe are not â we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike.â Â  âI think that once the nuclear alternative happens, itâs over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I canât take anything off the table.â Â  âBecause you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, weâre doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.â Â  âWhy didnât you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobodyâs ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way. Â So you say to yourself, why didnât they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.â Â  âAnd theyâre going to end up getting nuclear. I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day. Believe me, heâs not a happy camper.â Â  âBut I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place. Right now, itâs getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because theyâre in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.â Â  âAnd she doesnât say that, because sheâs got no business ability. We need heart. We need a lot of things. But you have to have some basic ability. And sadly, she doesnât have that.â Â  âAll you have to do is speak to them. Wait. You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I donât believe that Hillary has the stamina.â Â  âThe world â let me tell you. Let me tell you. Hillary has experience, but itâs bad experience. We have made so many bad deals during the last â so sheâs got experience, that I agree. Â But itâs bad, bad experience.â Â  âI never said thatâ¦ I didnât say thatâ¦ Where did you find this?â¦ Oh, really?â Â  âYou know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. Some of itâs said in entertainment. Some of itâs said â somebody whoâs been very vicious to me, Rosie OâDonnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.â Â  âBut you want to know the truth? Â IÂ was going to say somethingâ¦Â extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, âI canât do it. I just canât do it. Itâs inappropriate. Itâs not nice.â Wow. In hindsight, it would have probably been easier to list the things Trump said that completely and utterly ridiculous. When it finally came time to face off with Hillary Clinton on the debate stage, Trump failed miserably and totally embarrassedÂ himself. As Hillary said Monday night, Donald âlives in his own reality,â presumably a reality where he thinks he actually makes sense. 
Drugs can be a hell of a way to ruin your life. It takes a hold of your life, turns it upside down and very rarely ever lets you go.  Another drug that has taken the streets by storm is the drug SPICE…otherwise known as K2. Its toted as giving the same effects that marijuana does, but it’s synthetically made, so it doesn’t occur naturally. Also, a small detail to this drug is that it completely drives the user batshit crazy! There have been multiple reports of the drug being used on the streets, with the results being bodies of people completely strung out, laying around on the roads and sidewalks. Now of course there are a plethora of different types of the drug, all ranging in different highs. The user themselves matter as well, with some claiming that the high is just as good as marijuana, without any real adverse effects…then there are others, like this guy, who have complete nightmares…   In the case of this man, he believed he was receiving cannabis straight out…no doubt he was familiar with it as he stated: ‘Don’t tell me how to smoke weed, man’. He had no idea what he was actually smoking was indeed spice. This led to his elevated mood at first, relaxation and then ultimately an altered perception of reality…this was supposed to be a joke…I’m sure everyone that cares about him is just laughing their heads off about it. The mean was seen stumbling and falling all around, while the wastes of life were laughing and taking their sick advantage of the situation. The video ends with him completely laid out on the ground, with the idiots around him mumbling and walking off. Drugs are a hell of a freak show when someone is under their influence. Best to take this video as a reminder to stay away from this particular one…if you don’t want to see your skin melt right off of you. 
It used to be in ancient times that soldiers that fought for their nations were respected. History doesn’t remember ancient hippies, or archaic anti-war activist groups…probably because they were all killed…anyways, today this kind of despicable behavior is the norm. It’s not uncommon to encounter these kinds of people in your everyday life. They saturate the planet. Of course none of them have ever served their country and most likely would rather sacrifice the life of a human being (not their own) over an animal (Harambe). Not to say that bad soldiers don’t exit. They do. There’s bad guys in every walk of life and that should be expected.  But what happens when you have a memorial monument dedicated to a major battle in your country’s history totally desecrated by a disgusting excuse for a human being? Kelly Martin, 42, incensed public decency when she desecrated, and that’s exactly the word needed here, the monument in broad daylight in Grays, Essex… first in April when there were still Remembrance wreaths that were set upon it. If that wasn’t bad enough, this beastly woman did it again back in June – the day before the 100th anniversary of the start of the Battle of the Somme. Martin, who looked as disheveled as ever, shouted ‘f*** this’ as she was led down to the cells at Basildon Crown Court, on her way to receive her sentence.  Judge John Lodge, the lucky duck that had the privilege of passing sentencing, said: ‘Each of these offences is so serious that only a custodial sentence is appropriate. The two cases of outraging public decency involve urinating on a war memorial…Inevitably war memorials were constructed at the center of towns and villages so on a daily basis people could be reminded of the sacrifices made by people who died…People use them as a place around which they congregate and that’s not wrong, but when people take that step further and abuse them by urinating on them that’s a matter the court needs to take very seriously indeed.’ Speaking to the piss monster herself, Judge Lodge said this: ‘What makes your case particularly bad is having been caught doing it one time, when the nation was commemorating the worst battle of the First World War you were caught doing it again in the middle of the day.’ Throw the book at her Judge. She obviously hasn’t learned to be a human being. 
Montel Williams isnât afraid to express his absolute disgust and disdain for Republican nominee Donald Trump â heâs made it perfectly clear in the past that he would never support or vote for him, and continuously speaks out against the business mogul. Thatâs why there was nothing unusual about what Williams did over the weekend, when the radio talk show host called out one of Trumpâs biggest supporters â Pastor Mark Burns. When Williams saw Burns complaining about the mediaâs hesitance to call the weekend explosions in New York City a terror attack, he couldnât just let it slide. Twitter Burns was merelyÂ echoing what Trump himself had said, when the GOP presidential candidate jumped to conclusions and immediately called the explosion a âbombâ even before officials could investigate or confirm it. Fed up with the baseless fear mongering the Trump campaign has been become infamous for doing,Â Williams flat-out told Burns heâd had âenough of your crap.â Twitter Little did Burns know when he responded to Williams, that heâd just started a Twitter fight that he had no chance of winning: Twitter Williams was not going to back down, and as the day continued the men continued to take shots at each other, with Williams continuously calling the Trump-loving pastor out forÂ falsifying details of his past and stating that Burns wasÂ ânot even a real pastor.â What resulted was a seemingly never-ending stream of back and forth tweets, in which Burns was clearly on the losing side: Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Williams had ripped Burns a new one and exposed all of his flaws for all of social media to see. Several hours later, Williams ended his feud with Burns on a high note, reminding his followers that Burns had gotten himself into this mess: Twitter Twitter 
What you are about to see is disturbing. Keith Lamont Scott, the man killed by police in Charlotte, North Carolina had an awesome wife of 20 years who narrated and recorded the final tragic moments of his life. Mr. Scott suffered from a traumatic brain injury, and his wife repeatedly told the police this information in the minutes prior to the shooting. She also told them that he had no weapon, and that he had just taken his medication. Of course, the cops just kept shouting at the man to drop the gun that he didn’t have, before taking his life for no reason. Well, the cat’s out of the bag now. NBC News has the video, so, despite the fact that the cops and the City of Charlotte have been refusing to take the public’s demands for transparency seriously, the information is now out there thanks to the bravery of Mrs. Scott. Here is the news report, via NBC:  These cops have a whole hell of a lot of explaining to do on this one. They better release whatever information they have, and they better not try any funny business with cover-ups. This is a damning, disturbing, and heartbreaking video of yet another senseless death of a black man in America at the hands of the system that is supposed to serve and protect. At this point, there is just absolutely no reason to trust the police, period. They are clearly killing people with impunity and without consequence. The public is aware now, so somebody better be held accountable, or there will continue to be unrest, and more matches thrown on a powder keg that is surely soon to blow sky high. 
If thereâs anyone in this day and age who most definitely doesnât mince words, and will say what needs to be said, itâs Vice President Joe Biden. While speaking in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on a campaign stop for Hillary Clinton, Biden tore into some of the remarks from Mondayâs debate. Especially when Donald Trump seemed to think itâs perfectly fine to screw over the American people, or benefit from their sorrow. Biden said: âThis is a guy who said â and wants to be president â that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about?â Adding: âEvery president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what weâre supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are.â Then really getting to the core of it, he said: âHe does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have. They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they donât take pleasure from âYouâre fired.â They donât take pleasure knowing that they will benefit.â Biden also talked about how Trump seems proud of not paying taxes. Taxes that all of us have to pay and donât have the luxury of manipulating the tax code to our advantage. âHe acknowledged that he didnât pay taxes because, he said, heâs smart. Makes him smart. Tell that to the janitor in here whoâs paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me.â Biden knows, as we should all know by this point in the election, who the better choice is for Commander-in-Chief. He reiterates: âIf this choice isnât clear, I donât know â- my lordâ¦ What bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people.â And itâs true, the choice is abundantly clear â Hillary Rodham Clinton should and be our next president. Watch Biden lay into Trump here: WATCH: VP Biden goes off on Trump over Trumpâs comments about not paying taxes: âIt angers me! â¦ What in the hell is he talking about!?â pic.twitter.com/Qg5L5HcnvL â NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) September 27, 2016  
Newly released footage has shed a troubling new light on a 2011 police shooting in St. Louis, showing an officer gun down a black suspect and then planting a gun on the crime scene. Officer Jason Stockley and his partner Brian Bianchi had engaged drug suspect Anthony Lamar Smith in a high speed chase. Stockley can be heard saying “I’m going to kill this motherfucker.” The police rammed Smith off the road, and camera footage shows Stockley shooting five shots into the driver’s seat of Smith’s disabled car. New footage now reveals Stockley taking a gun out of a duffel back from the back of his own cruiser and planting it on Smith’s body. Stockley claimed in his report that Smith had pointed the weapon at him, justifying the use of lethal force. Subsequent DNA evidence on the gun, however, did not contain any DNA or fingerprints from Smith. Stockley will be tried for first degree murder. One of his initial hearings takes place on Oct. 3rd. Footage of the killing can be found here:             
By now we’ve all heard the new reports of Pokemon GO players wandering around at night, getting their jollies off fictitiously catching fictitious monster animals. Alright, maybe ‘jollies’ is a little over the line and I am being inconsiderate to feelings…but this is the real world, not a made up one, and if you want to walk round at night with your eyes glued to your cell phone, not taking into consideration what or who is around you, then by all that is good and decent, you leave yourself open for an attack… NO! Not by Pokemon! By REAL people who want your cell phone, your wallet and anything else of value that they can find! …Think of it as a ‘Got to catch em all!’ for muggers… except you’re the Pokemon.  Well, in this case I’m going to share with you right now, Pokemon GO Twitch user Rickeybot was brutally socked in the face by a mugger who walked up behind him and robbed him. What makes this violent outbreak a perfect example to share with other GO players is that it was all caught live on the very stream Rickeybot was using Sunday in New York City’s Central Park. Judging by the background, it seemed as if the Grand Army Plaza, a designated Pokestop, was the site of the mugging, according to the map he was using at the time.   Rickeybot was keeping his fans up to date using Twitter, like most millennials do these days. Turns out the Twitch user was socked straight in the jaw, which he had scanned at the hospital. Amazingly, it was only swollen without major damage, although judging by the video, it would seem as if he smacked his head on the ground or something because of the blood seen on his forehead. So, what’s the lesson we learn from Rickeybot, hmmm? Well, I could say stop playing a child’s game and grow up, but I realize the world we live in and I would be considered a dreaded, villainous ‘hater’ by the lot of Pokemon GO adult children…so instead, I say play on, my Pokemon GO brothers and sisters! Muggers need to make a living too. 
How can you tell when a man is so far gone that he’s obviously not fit to stand on a stage for 90 minutes? That opinion would likely differ from psychologist to psychologist, but certainly there are warning signs. Donald Trump has been running full-steam now for months. He’s constantly on the campaign trail, under the hot lights of the cameras with little time for rest. He’s a 70-year-old man and he refuses to let up. He’s been not only preparing for a debate with a world-class politician (no matter how much he denies it he knows the truth) and to “relax” he flies to Roanoke last-minute to hold a rally. It’s obviously catching up to him. Sunday night, less than 24 hours before he’s set to walk into the hall to get ready for the most important night of his life, Donald Trump is showing signs that he’s simply taken this thing too far and gone off the deep end. This incoherent tweet covers three topics that are completely unrelated. It shows that Trump’s mind is prone to wandering and while each topic by itself may have been a talking point used to pander to somebody, together it’s just gibberish: Five people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N.C. riots! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2016  Just…what is he talking about? If you’re trying to court the people you want to scare into voting for you, you talk about terrorism. If you want to court moderates concerned that drugs are seeping into the middle-class like never before you talk about opioid deaths. If you want to pander to your low-hanging fruit and court the racists you talk about riots in North Carolina. Talking about them together shows just one thing: Trump is coming unhinged. He’s obviously not ready and maybe even unfit to debate Hillary Clinton. This could be the end of the line for the Trump train. Featured image from file
On Wednesday, talk show legend Montel Williams posed a very simple question for conservatives: when are you going to take responsibility for their role in helping to create the violent situation in Charlotte, North Carolina? Just hours after Donald Trump proposed nationwide “Stop and Frisk” — a policy that was declared unconstitutional in New York. Responding to a question about “black-on-black crime,” Trump said he would “do stop-and-frisk” to solve the problem. “We did it in New York,” he said. “It worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive.” Stop-and-frisk did not, in fact, “work incredibly well.” In 2011, for example, black and Latino residents made up about 90 percent of people stopped, and 88 percent of those were innocent. Even in predominantly white neighborhoods, blacks and Latinos were stopped more than whites. “Donald Trump is having trouble with the facts,” New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark Viverito said in a statement regarding Trump’s remarks. “Stop and frisk as it was applied in New York City was unconstitutional, it didn’t reduce crime and it severely corroded the relationship between the police and the communities they serve.” Yes, “stop-and-frisk” is a racist practice, but his suggestion that it should be implemented nationwide really resonates with some of Trump’s die-hard supporters — namely white supremacists. “When are conservatives going to own their damn part in this? That asshole Trump just proposed national stop and frisk?” Williams, who has also been critical of protesters who have chosen to become violent, asked on Twitter. “WTF?” One of Trump’s “deplorables” calling himself “Big Daddy” climbed out of his basket and once again proved Hillary Clinton’s assessment of The Donald’s meth-fueled legion of ignoramuses correct. “He will control n*ggers unlike you cucks,” Big Daddy informed Williams. Naturally, more of Trump’s “deplorables” came out to play:  But Trump’s acolyte apparently did not know to whom he was speaking. “And now we know why these white supremacist bumpkins with no teeth married to their cousins love Trump,” Williams shot back:  “Big Daddy” has since slithered back into the basket and closed it, changing his name and protecting his tweets presumably because he realized that when you say racist things on the internet, people notice.  It’s interesting how “brave” Trump’s paper tigers are until someone puts them in their place. Featured image via screengrab  
Dang… and I thought our Social Justice Zealots were insane (I mean, they are. But this is NUTS). In this video, a Muslim woman from Perth, Australia, is having an unholy fit when she sees someone wearing a Pauline Hanson shirt. If you don’t know, Pauline Hanson is a right-wing senator in Australia who has proposed a ban on Muslim immigration in her country. Oh, and this confrontation took place on a university campus, which doesn’t surprise me – Well, she’s got the special snowflake screeching down. I’ll give her that much. According to this, the man with the shirt said he was a former student coming to meet with someone on campus and he has every right to be there, even though the Muslim woman demanded he leave. Just because he was wearing a shirt. Listen lady – maybe that’s how they do things in Islamic countries where you aren’t even allowed to THINK anything that goes against Muslim beliefs, but in first-world civilizations, we welcome ALL KINDS of opinions. Well, that’s the theory, at least. Maybe not much longer if the Cult of Social Justice gets their way.
The stated reason the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department didn’t release their body cam and dash cam footage of the shooting was that by doing so, it might interfere with the investigation. Amid calls from the public and Keith Scott’s family to release the footage of the shooting, the police have now decided to comply with those demands. Police chief Kerr Putney had been saying that the video footage didn’t show conclusive evidence that Scott was holding a gun. Neither footage from the dash cam and one of the officers body cams showed it, and the officer who fatally shot Scott – Brentley Vinson, a black man – wasn’t wearing a body camera. GRAPHIC VIDEO: part of the dash-cam video released by @CMPD #KeithScott @TWCNewsCLT pic.twitter.com/fGAYdQpiAs — Christina Watkins (@CWatkinsTV) September 24, 2016   So, the footage has now been released, but it doesn’t make the incident any clearer. Scott is seen very briefly and from no angles that show whether or not he was holding a weapon. What is seen in the video, however, is Scott inching backwards right before he got shot. He didn’t appear to be pointing anything at anyone. So, if he had a gun in his hand, he wasn’t aiming at any of the cops. Marijuana joint Was it necessary for the police to shoot Scott? It’s hard to say at this point, since all we have are bits and pieces, and the police report. According to an eyewitness account, Scott didn’t have anything in his hand, and he was reading a book. That we know probably wasn’t the case, since the police didn’t recover a book from the scene. And they did recover a handgun and an ankle holster. And a marijuana joint. Probably not a book. I’m usually torn with these kinds of shootings. On one hand, I understand that police are on edge when a civilian has a gun. But too often – not necessarily in this case – police overreact and shoot when there really wasn’t a threat. When police do overreact, I don’t think it’s evidence of “racism.” I think it’s evidence that our society is on edge. Civilians are afraid that the police will abuse their authority, and the police are afraid that civilians will shoot at them. Both sides have issues that need to be resolved, and until that happens, officer-involved shootings will continue.

Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke — one of Donald Trump’s loudest surrogates — is even crueler than previously thought. The April 24, 2016 death of 38-year-old Terrill Thomas has been officially ruled as a homicide, with the cause of Thomas’ death being attributed to “profound dehydration,” after an autopsy by the Milwaukee County medical examiner. According to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, inmates heard Thomas plead with jail guards for water while being held in connection with a shooting. Marcus Berry, who occupied the cell across from Thomas for the last six days of his life, said guards were purposefully denying him water due to Thomas’ erratic behavior in his previous cell. However, the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office declined to comment on whether or not inmates were denied water due to disciplinary reasons. “I could tell he was getting weaker,” Berry said. “One day he just lay down, dehydrated and hungry.” When Berry asked if Thomas needed water, he said it sounded like Thomas tried to say “yeah” but couldn’t fully speak. Berry said he urged a correctional officer to bring Thomas water, but said he was told it would have to wait until another officer was on duty. “You can’t punish someone by depriving them of the nourishment they need to survive,” said Erik Heipt, an attorney specializing in wrongful death lawsuits for inmates, in an interview with the . Thomas isn’t the only inmate to die of thirst in Sheriff Clarke’s custody. The reported that between 2010 and 2014, ten people died while being held by the Milwaukee Sheriff’s Office. Antonio Cowser, who died in 2010, had water shut off in his cell after going on a hunger strike. In an official press release, the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office said it would refuse to comment on Thomas’ death until all investigations have concluded.          
How mad do you have to be to be able to break a knife blade a girls neck when you stab her over 100 times? Apparently as mad as a Muslim man on Monday! This unemployed, 32-year-old Muslim bag of sh*t named Jamiv Usman got dumped by his then teenage girlfriend, Shannon Reynolds, and couldn’t handle it like a man. I believe she was 19 and he was 30 at the time. That’s perfectly within the legal limits if you’re at a strip club, but I don’t think a 30-year-old should be predatory towards a relationship with a 19-year-old. Especially if he’s unemployed and can’t even provide for a family because he’s a loser. She wanted the lazy jobless Muslim OUT of their apartment. She wanted him away from her child. She wanted NOTHING to do with this Muslim man who would soon turn violent. Jamiv Usman didn’t respond well to this. He was boiling over like a pot of hot water ready to soften egg noodles for dinner. Get the knife ready for the steak, because what happens next is absolute HORROR. After all her requests and demands for the psychopath Muslim to leave, he had the nerve to ask her for a drink of water. Sounds reasonable if you’re an employed Muslim providing for his woman, but that wasn’t the case with this Allahu Akbar creep. She said no and he literally tipped over like that pot of boiling water and BRUTALLY stabbed her over 100 times with a knife. He stabbed so hard that he BROKE THE KNIFE IN HER NECK!  Rightwing News – She wanted him out of her apartment and she told him to get out. Tensions were brewing and it eventually led Usman to stab Reynold’s over 100 times. The last straw for Usman was when he asked her to get him a drink of water and she said no. That’s when he grabbed a big kitchen knife and plunged it into her body over 100 times in front of the toddler. He stabbed her so hard that he broke the tip of the knife in her neck. Amazingly, she survived. She played dead. He left. She crawled to a bus stop and got help. Eventually she healed and was able to identify her stabber and watch a judge order Usman to serve up to 20 years in prison.   The good news is that this strong woman survived and recovered to see her Muslim attacker thrown to the wolves in prison. Hopefully the violent Muslim will serve his full 20 year sentence and learn his lesson in prison. Will he be shanked 100 times in the neck? Probably not. Those guys in prison know how to shank you once and make it count. The other 99 slashes would be for fun. I bet Shannon Reynolds also got sick of him being unable to be a responsible adult who is an equal force in a relationship. What did he do for her? Nothing, it seems. Muslim men are suppressors and oppressors. They’re like a woman’s worst nightmare. Why would any woman date a Muslim man? Don’t they know by now that Muslim men treat women worse than anything. I’m sure he could’ve found another gullible girl to date on a dating site. In fact, here’s a few ideas for dating sites specifically for Muslims! If these ever become a thing, then women can sign up to be abused, stabbed, and forced to drape themselves in a black 84-inch table cloth in 95 degree weather. Dating site ideas for Muslims PlentyofBurkas.com – who needs fish when you can have a barrel of burkas. ForcedMatch.com – because what girl really signs up for this? MuslimMingle.com – let the sparks fly…into a building of course! TNTHarmony.com – go through 48 pages of questions to meet your perfect suicide partner. TanPeopleMeet.com – Because SandPeopleMeet was already taken. DynamiteTinder.com – swipe left to explode. MuslimWifeFinder – no girls, goats, and boys over 12 – lifetime guarantee. Bomble – explosive dating for Muslim clock builders. OKVest – strictly for suicide vests enthusiasts. FarmersOnly – where else can we find a hefty supply of goats? Oh look, I think we found a match! Sorry underage girls, boys, and goats – this one is taken for the next 20 years. Search again.  And if anyone is wondering about calculating the force of stabbing hard enough to break the tip off in a woman’s neck, then read this. And when you know the answer to “what the f*ck is wrong with people” then please tell us. We’re still searching for an answer. 
Hillary Clinton has taken her illegal actions to a new level with a new move that involves enlisting the help of illegal immigrants to help her beat Donald Trump in November. Once again, Hillary is in violation of 8 U.S. Code § 1324, which makes it a felony to ‘conceal’ or ‘harbor’ any ‘alien’ ‘including any means of transportation.’ The penalty is five years in prison (ten years if it was done for “commercial advantage or private financial gain,” could be made for that). Hillary and the DNC also violated this law a few weeks back at the Democratic National Convention when they paraded two illegal immigrants across the stage to give an anti-Trump speech. From Fox News: Hillary Clinton is enlisting undocumented “Dreamers” into a new voter registration drive aimed at signing up sympathetic voters with warnings that Donald Trump’s immigration plans could result in their deportation – though the Dreamers themselves cannot legally vote.   Clinton’s national voter registration program, called “Mi Sueño, Tu Voto/My Dream, Your Vote,” was announced Sunday, on the four-year anniversary of the 2012 order that temporarily shielded from deportation some young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. The 730,000 young people known as Dreamers are prohibited from voting. However, they remain a powerful political organizing force, and the Clinton campaign hopes to use them to convince Latino and other households to go to the polls for the Democratic nominee.  
The cornerstone of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign can be summed up in just a few words: Things suck and it’s all Obama’s fault. For Trump, this tweet pretty much optimizes his take on poverty: Our country does not feel ‘great already’ to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty, violence and despair. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2016  This was in response to President Obama saying during the Democratic National Convention that “America is already great.” So, who is correct? Are Americans trapped in a socioeconomic hell hole or are things far more optimistic? According to a study published by the , things are vastly better for Americans than they were when Obama took office in 2009. The article began by profiling Alex Caicedo of Gaithersburg, MD. A few years ago, Caicedo was struggling with odd and part time jobs. He and his family were forced to live with his mother-in-law. Today, he has a steady middle class job with benefits and the family is ready to move out of his mother-in-law’s home. They are far from alone. The Caicedos are among the 3.5 million Americans who were able to raise their chins above the poverty line last year, according to census data released this month. More than seven years after the recession ended, employers are finally being compelled to reach deeper into the pools of untapped labor, creating more jobs, especially among retailers, restaurants and hotels, and paying higher wages to attract workers and meet new minimum wage requirements. What about the minorities, who, according to Trump, have never had it worse? Well, that’s another Trump lie. Not only have minorities suffered much, much worse throughout history (slavery, Jim Crow), but they too have it dramatically better since Obama took office. Poverty declined among every group. But African-Americans and Hispanics — who account for more than 45 percent of those below the poverty line of $24,300 for a family of four in most states — experienced the largest improvement. Sorry, Republicans, but you don’t get an ounce of credit for the improvements. If anything, things would be much better if Republicans weren’t in office. The Times credits social programs like Social Security and food stamps for keeping people out of poverty. They also credit the fall in oil prices for people being able to commute to their jobs. One major factor, and Republicans will hate this, is that the increases in minimum wage are also taking people out of poverty. After a long period of rising inequality, Elise Gould, an economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute in Washington, added, the benefits of the improving economy finally began to seep downward. Wage increases were “even stronger at the bottom than in the middle,” she said. Still, it’s not enough. 43 million Americans still live in poverty. Republicans have successfully blocked poor people from acquiring college degrees or job training that might help raise people out of poverty. For those without access to computers or the internet, finding a job can be burdensome. For those who can’t afford cars, a job search can be impossible. If this proves anything, it should be that it’s time to continue successful Democratic policies, not cut them off at the knees, as Republicans would do. 
Donald Trump got off to a great start during Monday night’s debate, his first presidential debate with Hillary Clinton. But his performance wasn’t without bumps. So, did Trump appear like a legitimate candidate tonight? And did Hillary maintain her status as a policy wonk who knows her stuff ? Was she able to fend off claims that she is shrill? And what of the moderator? Was Lester Holt a moderator, or was he a third debater and on Hilary’s side, at that? This was a very historic debate, certainly. Hillary Clinton, the first female candidate from a major party, met Donald Trump, one of the first political neophytes and businessmen to gain the nomination of a major party, are engaged in an election that for many is about all the marbles. Many, both left and right, feel that if their candidate doesn’t win it will be a catastrophe for the nation. While Democrats feel that if Trump wins they may end up in the political wilderness for decades, Republicans are equally sure that if Hillary wins she will finish the destruction of the nation started by Barack Obama. What ever might happen in the months to come, this, the first of three debates, did not end Trump’s campaign. He held his own well enough against Hillary’s wonky demeanor, and was able to stand toe-to-toe with her for the entire 90-minute debate. He also didn’t commit any major gaffes and pulled the reins back on the sort of extreme combativeness we saw from him during his primary debates. But Trump missed a lot of opportunities and seemed on the defensive throughout. While he was still forceful and in places combative, Trump was able to successfully slam home one message. His main line of attack during the night was that Hillary has spent 30 years in government leading this nation with the polices she advocated tonight, yet this nation is failing and our world is more dangerous than ever. Donald Trump wondered aloud how all her wonderful plans would change anything that she hasn’t been able to change in her 20 years in power? In the end, though, Trump did not hurt himself in this debate, something that will surely discourage liberals supporting Hillary. It is doubtful that Trump lost any supporters even as he may not have picked up any new acolytes. As to Hillary, she didn’t get shrill and even once or twice seemed to respond like a real human might. She seemed in command of her ideas and generally kept an even tone. In the final analysis, though, this outing should likely be scored as something of a tie and in that case the challenger might be awarded a bit of a win. After all, this was Trump’s first one-on-one presidential debate against a candidate who has been in a dozen of them over two presidential campaigns yet he was able to keep he head about him and say mostly on track with only a few instances where he got bogged down. He’ll likely get even better at this over the next two outings. As to moderator Holt, it was clear he bowed to pressure from his pals on the left to become the third candidate on the stage. He constantly interrupted Trump and was clearly on Hillary’s side throughout the night. By contrast he almost never interrupted Hillary. The night started with moderator Lester Holt opening the debate with questions on the economy. Like a Democrat does, Hillary essentially answered to the question of how she would fix this nation’s faltering economy by unloading yet another laundry list of big government programs. In fact, her entire appeal seemed to be fully centered on Democrat tactics of the 1990s. Hillary insisted that her tax plan would help small businesses create jobs. And yet, she made this claim only days after releasing her confiscatory estate tax plan that critics say would make sure no family farm or small business could ever be passed down from parent to child because her tax rate is so high that families would have to sell those businesses and farms to pay her 65 percent taxes hit. This sort of uncertainty is not a builder of small business. It is a destroyer of them. When Holt turned to Trump, the GOP candidate went into his familiar “America doesn’t win any more” talking points and added that his tax cut plan would be the biggest since Ronald Reagan’s and would send the economy booming again. Incidentally, this is precisely what Hillary’s husband, Bill Clinton, did in the mid 1990s to reverse the economic disaster he set in motion with his own disastrous tax hike. When he first came to office, Bill bowed to the left of his party and raised taxes but after his party was wiped out in the 1994 midterm elections because the economy was sinking under his policies he abruptly changed direction, lowered taxes, and helped bring back national prosperity. This is a lesson Hillary obviously has not learned if her high tax policy is any indication. In any case, Trump hit over and over on his claim that we need to stop American jobs and businesses from fleeing the country and noted that Hillary’s policies are little different than Obama’s and that she would not be able to stop jobs from leaving America. Incidentally, the segment was another example of Lester Holt joining team Hillary as he insisted calling Trump’s tax plan “tax cuts for the wealthy” when in fact his plan would cut taxes for 60 percent of U.S. households. In response, Hillary threw out one of her catch phrases calling Trump’s policy “Trumped up trickle down,” in a tactic again reminiscent of tired old 1990s liberal talking points. The Democrat nominee also claimed that her massive tax hike would create 10 million jobs, a claim that is hard to fathom. Sadly Trump missed the opportunity to note that this is the same lie Obama used when he took office and his reputation as a jobs creator is dismal, indeed. Trump could have pointed out how Hillary’s nonsense is just like Obama’s and we have a sluggish economy with millions out of work as a result. Another tactic Hillary employed early and often throughout the debate was to urge the media to “fact check” Trump. This is just a continuation of her coordination with the same media that put out a slew of Trump hit pieces three days before the debate. Trump went on to hit Hillary on the NAFTA and TPP trade polices as he has been doing for months, now. What ever you feel about NAFTA, Hillary did not mount a very effective response to Trump’s accusation and indeed she used a false claim against Trump as she did so. Hillary insisted that Trump cheered the housing crisis when people were losing their homes late in the 2000s. Hillary has uttered this lie many times, but even CNN noted that the claim is not true. Trump did not celebrate people losing their homes. The issue of Trump’s tax returns next came up but Trump got the better of Hillary with the question and got the crowd to break its pledge of silence at the same time. When the partisan Holt asked Trump if he’ll release his tax returns, he replied, “I’ll release my tax returns when she releases her 33,000 emails that she deleted.” The crowd erupted in cheers but were then scolded by Holt for breaking the silence pledge. Hillary’s only real response was to Harry Reid-like claim that Trump doesn’t want to release his taxes because he has never paid any federal taxes at all. However her attack line on Trump has been proven incorrect even by the so-called “fact checkers” she kept trying to press into service to go after Trump. Fact check site Politifact has said Hillary’s claim that Trump paid no taxes is “mostly false.” Trump also made some great points when he noted that the U.S.A. is a “serious debtor nation” with an infrastructure that is falling apart and the nation needs a new leader who “has an idea about money.” Moderator Holt then moved onto the the racial divide and in her answer Hillary insisted that America’s police are racists who need re-education. In her opinion, our police are “implicitly biased” against blacks. Trump then reminded America that it was Hillary who said that blacks were “super predators,” a statement she later had to apologize for. But Trump hit a bad spot when asked to once again respond to his former birtherism. Trump rambled and was not able to successfully reply to the issue on stage. Hillary made herself look petty, though. when she called Trump’s birtherism a “racist lie.” Whatever you believe about where Obama was born, the issue has nothing to do with his race. It has to do with his citizenship. That wasn’t the end of Hillary’s name calling. She later directly called Trump a racist, as well, for his words against the importation of Muslim terrorists. Hillary also said Trump is anti-woman despite the fact that Trump employs more women in high positions than most big New York companies. The attacks gave Trump a good opening to reiterate that Hillary has spend hundreds of millions of campaign dollars on vicious attack ads on TV, yet despite the expenditure, the two candidates are virtually tied in the polls. The lie about Trump being a racist was far from the only lie Clinton told this night. Clinton also disgorged a series of other lies during the debate. In one case Hillary insisted that when she became Obama’s Secretary of State Iran was “weeks away” from having a nuclear bomb. But in truth there is no intelligence estimate from any country that supports her claim. Clinton also insisted she was against the Trans Pacific Trade agreement in its early stages. But in fact, Hillary called the TPP scheme the “gold standard” of trade agreements and was a major supporter of the plan. So, what did we end up with last night? As noted above, the night was more or less a tie. No one who supports either candidate would have been swayed to abandon their support. Neither came away with any knock out blows and both held their own. We move on to round two wondering if we may yet see something that might become a game changer. But the immediate post debate period was interesting in that it showed what sort of candidate Trump really is. As is usual for a presidential candidate after a debate, Hillary Clinton disappeared after waving to supporters. But Trump made himself available to the media right away. Trump’s talking to Sean Hannity and other members of the media as he exited the stage marks a first for a presidential candidate and it only goes to highlight the fact that Hillary went well over 200 days before speaking to the media while Trump has made himself available the whole campaign. So, what did you think of the debate? Tell us in the comments below. 
Americanism vs. Globalism – Democrats think we’re in a war of words with radicals who are “hijacking” Islam, while Republicans understand that this is a real war against savages who are killing any who oppose them. America is more at war with itself than with the external enemies that are working at destroying us.  Trump and Hillary are now leading the opposing factions in America who see the country from opposite points of view. To the Right, the nation is being destroyed by foreigners who are immigrating to America who don’t want to assimilate to become Americans, but make Americans to assimilate and become like them, and corrupt criminals in Washington are assisting them. To the Left, America is a nation of greedy, racist haters who have imposed themselves on other nations to steal resources from them, and Americans are fearful of progress, fearful of other people, and selfishly refuse to become a nation of the world’s global culture. The problem with America, leftists believe, is that self-righteous, hateful Christians are resistant to the good sense of atheists and the peaceful religion of Islam. They label terrorists conducting mass shootings, bombings, and genocides as Islamist jihadis. Obama and Hillary say they are not Islamists, but atheists who are trying to incite a war by duping Christians into condemning good Muslims.  Moslems who want to impose Sharia law on the world are good people they say.

There’s a reason that it’s called terrorism. It’s because ISIS, and terrorist groups like them, use fear and propaganda as a means to intimidate people into getting what they want. With ISIS and other Islamic terrorists, what they want is to force people to convert to Islam and live their lives subservient to their Muslim rulers. Anyone who refuses is branded an infidel and faces death. ISIS even puts out hit lists of those who they want to target for their non-belief.   While the notion of being put on a terrorist hit list may strike fear into most people’s hearts, Marines aren’t bothered in the slightest. They welcome it, actually, because if the terrorists try to attack the Marines, then they don’t have to worry about hunting them down. Not only are they not intimidated, they’re rubbing their lack of intimidation in the terrorists’ faces. A series of billboards have been erected across the nation to let terrorists know that Marines are ready for them. And it surely will make terrorists think twice before taking on the United States Marine Corps:   Considering how many terrorist attacks the United States has seen over the past year, there couldn’t be a better time for the Marine Corps to send this message to the terrorists. Liberals were furious over it naturally, but they will bend over backwards to placate terrorists and will do everything they can to prevent Americans from being able to defend themselves. Who cares what they think? And this message drives a stake right through the heart of the terrorist agenda. Remember, what they want is to make people afraid. These billboards show that not only are the Marines not afraid, they’re ready to take the fight to the terrorists. If we’re not afraid, then the terrorists lose.   Sorry, ISIS. Game over. Share this on Facebook if you agree with this badass statement! 
Join the Citizen Journalist Revolution at www.iPatriot.com Terrorism is terrorism, regardless of the source, and two American cities felt the sting of it over the weekend. Is it really that hard to say? Apparently. And if someone on the left does summon up the word, it must always be supplemented with a descriptor. One of two terrorist attacks, a bombing, occurred this weekend in Manhattan, N.Y. “No-one has come forward to admit to planting the device, which exploded in a dumpster,” Cuomo said, but citizens should make no mistake: “a bomb exploding in New York is an act of terrorism.” Got that. At the time he stated (Sunday morning), that no one, or group, had claimed responsibility. Yet he was quick to insist it was not the work of ISIS, or any specific group. However, he also added that, “We’re not going to let them win. They want to make you afraid. We’re not going to let them instill fear.” Okay – so Cuomo admitted he/we don’t know who the bomber is, yet he knows for a fact it is definitely not ISIS, but we can’t let THEM win. If he/we don’t know who the bomber is – may I ask who THEM is? Knowing that even in the face of tragedy, democrats consider everything through a political lens – is the definitely “not ISIS” exclamation by Governor Cuomo a veiled attempt not to tie Obama’s mass immigration of Muslims to the U.S.? I don’t know, but I wouldn’t doubt it. The Manhattan bomber may not be the work of an Islamist, but the attack at a Minnesota mall on Saturday sure was. As I stated, regardless of the source, the two acts were terrorism none the less. It is not hard to say – terrorism, unless you’re NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, who, like many apologists on the left, just couldn’t bring himself to utter the word. When pressed, he merely stated… Read the rest of the story at www.iPatriot.com  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.
Please disable your Ad Blocker in order to interact with the site. Well THAT’S Weird. If the Birther movement is racist… does that mean that the person who wrote this had it in for Obama? What if that person is … Obama? Breitbart put this out, taken from the AP, entitled ““Kenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate” That was June 2004. Kenyan-born US Senate hopeful, Barrack Obama, appeared set to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his main rival, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race on Friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations. The allegations that horrified fellow Republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given Obama a clear lead as Republicans struggled to fetch an alternative. As far as we know, Barack Obama never refuted this article. It’s still out there on the internet. Here’s a screen capture:  Here’s the bottom half of the same article with AP attribution.  And the link to the original. That’s not actually as weird as the one all the way back in 1991. That was Obama’s publicist. Here’s the quote: Breitbart News has obtained a promotional booklet produced in 1991 by Barack Obama’s then-literary agency, Acton & Dystel, which touts Obama as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” The booklet, which was distributed to “business colleagues” in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of Obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by Acton & Dystel. It also promotes Obama’s anticipated first book, Journeys in Black and White–which Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead. If Obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain? If his birth in America is valid — as we are led to believe? Why lie about it? Unless playing the ‘foreigner’ card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of … whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly. Because if That WASN’T a lie… then something else MUST be. That ‘something else’ being his American birth and Citizenship. Which are prerequisites to his presidency. The quote can be read in context at Breitbart. 
Like father like daughter. Just sayin’. On the day that Al Sharpton is due here in Tulsa to try and gin up riots, I read that his daughter has run into a snag on her $5 million lawsuit against New York City. You see, once upon a time, two years ago, Dominique Sharpton decided to cross the street in the Big Apple. She claims she stepped into a pothole and heard a loud snap. And so commenced Sharpton Jr’s lawfare. There seems to be a number of problems with Dominique’s lawsuit and her attempt at becoming an instant millionaire. First off, when she went to the emergency room, nothing was broken. Drat! But she sued anyway citing physical therapy and emotional distress. She had to exist in a therapeutic boot and have ligament surgery… allegedly. But of course, that’s not the end of the story by a long shot.  From the Independent Review Journal: Nearly two years ago, on October 2nd, 2014, Sharpton said that she suffered an injury while crossing the street in New York City. She says that she stepped into a pothole in the street at the intersection of Broome St. and Broadway, at which point she heard “a snap.” Soon afterward, Sharpton pursued a lawsuit against the city, citing continued pain and suffering. Her medical records showed a visit to the emergency room (nothing was broken), physical therapy, some time in a therapeutic boot, and ligament surgery. But as the details of her $5 million lawsuit came out, people began to notice that she wasn’t exactly behaving like someone who was in constant pain: Sharpton was dancing at her father’s 60th birthday celebration just hours after her horrific accident… in high heels. She’s made constant trips to Miami to be with her love interest and best of all… she went hiking in Bali. A judge has now ordered she cannot delete the photos that she stupidly posted to Instagram. Double drat!! It’s getting harder and harder for a budding shyster to make a living these days. Dominique claimed that she could only wear heels for a very short period of time. On her hike in Bali, she claims you couldn’t see that she was helped constantly by comrades and had to take frequent breaks. My heart breaks, I tell ya. She also lamented her inability to “dive off a diving board, go skiing, or go run marathons.” Now comes the hysterical part… When city attorney Michelle Fox asked Sharpton if she had been a marathon runner prior to her accident, Sharpton replied: “Not necessarily. But if I, you know, if I needed to do it and I was exercising or something like that, I was capable of it. Now, I can’t.” It sounds like a very bad joke, but unfortunately it is not. The judge should dismiss this frivolous lawsuit and send Sharpton a bill. Tell her daddy he can pay for it… he won’t. He never does pay his bills and corruption is a family pastime.   
Hillary Clinton says that Christians are bigoted and deplorable. They are discriminator using ‘code talk’ in her opinion. You know how liberals decry stereotyping of groups? That does not seem to slow them down in their treatment of conservatives and Christians. Oh, and they are homophobic and Islamophobic as well. Geez. Read more below!  As Written By Ken Klukowski for Breitbart: Hillary Clinton: Christians are Bigoted and Deplorable, ‘Religious Liberty’ Code for Discrimination. Christians across America should be terrified by Hillary Clinton’s denouncing of Trump supporters as “bigoted” people who are so “deplorable” that they are “irredeemable,” because she was primarily talking about people of faith, as reflected by one of her top Democratic supporters just one day before Clinton’s infamous speech. While many commentators were stunned by Clinton’s comments, most have overlooked the setting and context. Clinton was speaking in New York City at an LGBT event. And she specified that the “bigoted” and “irredeemable” people she was denouncing are both homophobic and Islamophobic. Observant Christians in 2016 are repeatedly called bigoted and homophobic for holding to biblical teaching and church doctrine that marriage is between a man and a woman, that sexuality should be expressed only between married couples, and that a person’s sex is part of how God deliberately made them, and is something they should embrace. These leftists also say that these observant Christians are anti-woman because believing in protecting the life of the unborn is a form of “discrimination.” Clinton’s charge of Islamophobia was broadly cast against Americans who raise concerns regarding what certain segments within Islam—not all Muslims, but rather those who adhere the versions that embrace violence and jihad—believe and whether this should…..

Please disable your Ad Blocker in order to interact with the site. The establishment and complicit media is already in full cover-up mode to save Hillary in the polls. Here is the full cover up as it has already begun. Hillary Clinton calling the explosions in Chelsea, New York a bombing and then directly after making that statements a press correspondent asked her how she felt about Donald Trump taking the stage and calling it a bombing. To which of course she made the statement “it’s wiser to wait” – watch and be disgusted with the complicit media and the democrat nominee for president of the United States not even remember what they said moments before. 
The Clintons understand the average American. They know what it’s like to be dead broke. Hillary Clinton is so a woman of the people. She’s just like you. (Except for making millions of dollars off the backs of the taxpayers and suffering from Disingenuous Lying Seahag Syndrome). Bill Clinton is just like you! (Minus being an unapologetic rapist, of course.) Chelsea Clinton is just like you! (Except for getting paid $600,000 a year by NBC to basically do nothing.) Bill and Hillary are notorious for charging a sinful amount of money to speak at events. We’re talking $250,000+. Luckily, their daughter Chelsea is a lot more affordable. She’ll speak and take some photos for a measly $65,000. That’s it. Talk about a bargain. But wait– it gets BETTER! The Hillary Clinton campaign held a super fun “Conversation with Chelsea” event at Penn State University Wednesday. And look. The Clintons understand that college students aren’t made of money, so they decided to charge students $500 to attend the event. A student could also get a picture with Chelsea for a small donation of $1,000 and could get access to the reception for $2,700. Talk about a deal! So $500 bare minimum. I mean, $500 is nothing to a broke college student, amirite? Just kidding. Even college students– individuals famous for being progressive Clinton worshipping robots– thought it was ridiculous that Hillary would charge students hundreds of dollars to have a “conversation” with Chelsea. “Although we certainly support Chelsea’s right to campaign on her mother’s behalf, we do not agree with Mrs. Clinton choosing to make this ‘conversation’ available exclusively to individuals who can afford or are willing to pay at least $500,” said Ethan Paul, vice president of College Progressives of Penn State, the newspaper reported Wednesday. “It is particularly deplorable that a $2,700 donation—the legal limit—gets a personal conversation with Mrs. Clinton.”   “Putting such an expensive price on involvement in elections really hurts college students who already feel there is no point to politics,” added College Progressive Secretary Kathryn Van Develde. But listen, kids. Hillary understands you. She really does. And she thinks it’s ridiculous that you have to go into debt to just obtain a degree. Please pay $2,700 to talk to her about it. h/t Washington Times
Liberals are not known for their rationality and logic. The entire liberal movement revolves around emotion and assuaging their poor, hurt feelings while telling people whatever they want to hear. On top of that, they’re hyper-sensitive, shrieking in outrage and demanding safe spaces whenever they’re confronted with anything that doesn’t fit into their narrow liberal worldview. One liberal learned the hard way that the rest of the world doesn’t always play along.   Some crazy liberal girl was driving along to pick up her son from school when she was confronted with the worst thing she could possibly come across: a homeowner with Trump signs on his lawn. She said that she drives past his house occasionally and it makes her absolutely enraged, having to see a private citizen expressing his own First Amendment rights. So when she saw him in his driveway, she flipped him off and then called the police when he started following her. Unfortunately, things didn’t quite go as planned.   The “mother f***er”, as she described him, got in his car and photographed her car and license plate. So. she reacted exactly as expected, with maturity and wisdom. Ha! Not exactly. Instead, she yelled, “Back off, you f***ing racist!” and began honking her horn and flashing her lights at him. This drew the attention of a police officer, who informed her that she was now a public disturbance, as she was carrying on like a lunatic in a school zone. She explained to the officer that she was recording him, for all of her social media “followers” and told the officer that she flipped off the man for having Trump signs displayed. “My question is, why would you even go out of your way to do that?” the officer, very reasonably, asked. Her answer? Because she’s angry about the election, which evidently gives her the right to do whatever the heck she wants. The officer, however, told her that she was letting her emotions get the best of her and to just move on. And then she really lost it. “Move on? There is a racist, xenophobic maniac running for president and that guy is supporting him and if I give him the finger, that’s a peaceful… ” she ranted. “My point is that I silently protested something I don’t agree with.” So she can give someone the finger because she has First Amendment rights, but this man — who she disagrees with — evidently should not be allowed to express his own opinions and beliefs, all because she doesn’t like them. And Miss Crazy Pants learned the hard way that she can’t do whatever she wants without consequences. “What you need to do is stay away from him,” he said. “Don’t drive by his residence.” She responded that she has to drive by his house, so the officer warned her that he has cameras outside recording her actions. “I would recommend that you just drive on next time,” he said. “Don’t start fights.” Ouch. 
While giving a speech at a church rally in Cleveland, Donald Trump confused everyone by actually siding with a victim of police brutality instead of law enforcement â and itâs gotten him in trouble with Americaâs largest police union. In speaking to the rally goers in Cleveland, Trump strayed from his normal, pro-cop rhetoric to say a few unflattering words about Betty Shelby, the Tulsa police officer who shot an unarmed black man. Clearly worried about how horrendously his attempts to reach black voters have failed, Trump gave an unusually thoughtful response to a group of African American pastors, in which he suggested that Shelby had âchokedâ: âNow, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they canât be doing what theyâre doing, okay? They canât be doing what theyâre doing. I watched the shooting in particular in Tulsa. And that man was hands up.Â That man went to the car, hands up, put his hand on the car. I mean, to me, it looked like he did everything youâre supposed to do, and he looked like a really good man.â Trump made these comments just five days after theÂ Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), which has 330,000 members, endorsed him. But after hearing Trump criticize the Tulsa police officer, FOP executive director Jim Pasco is livid and thinks Trumpâs comments were inappropriate. Pasco said that TrumpÂ âmust be mindful of the due process rights and presumption of innocence accorded to all, including police officers.â Now, no one should be proud or relieved that Trump finally decided to acknowledge police brutality victims â heâs been known to pander to whatever audience he is in front of at any given moment, and is notorious for flip-flopping almost instantly. This speech was easy for Trump to say in front of black pastors â I doubt he would have dared to say this in front of a predominately white audience. Trump also knows he is struggling tremendously with the minority vote, which may very well determine this election. Trump will say whatever he needs to win â but this time, he lost a major support group. Hereâs the clip that got Trump in trouble with the police union:  
Scroll down for video It’s often been said with some humor,that behind every conservative lies a liberal who was once mugged, and perhaps black activist Jerry Ford Jr. will become the latest robbery victim to join the ever-growing ranks. This latest incident took place on the campus at the University of Houston when grad student Ford a ‘Black Lives Matter” member and group leader was robbed at gun point, as he was about to enter his apartment. He describes walking by a young man apparently loitering next to his apartment complex, and thought nothing of it until he unlocked his door, and then the young thug sprung into action, pulling out a hand gun and demanding Ford’s wallet and cell phone, which of course Ford surrendered. Ironically Ford is running for Texas State Representative, while also a vocal activist and head of Houston Chapter of “Black Lives Matter”, which of course promotes the de-funding of many police programs around the country. And which of course made his comments after being robbed all the more ludicrous stating: “I hope they (the police), would take a bigger stance and put more security over here because you have a lot of people walking back and forth to class.” Ford also added that because the housing is off campus, it isn’t patrolled by university police security, which he would like to see it changed for the protection of the students…it would seem that a conservative by any other name, is a liberal once mugged. Then after this BLM "activist" actually had the nerve to actually ask for more protection from the police he comically had this to say about the thief, "I would've gave him money," he said. "I would've talked to him because the real crime is why is he in that position that he feels the need to come and hang out at a college campus and rob people of stuff they worked for." Right. Good idea Jerry. That will solve the problem. Check out Ford's call for MORE police presence here: Source: ABC 13 
CNN news has claimed through polling that Hillary Clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate. But others indicate otherwise. Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner. Talking points included the Birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and Trump’s tax returns as well as other things. Look at some of the snap polls below. They include TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville among many others.  Donald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it. The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent. Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. Thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll. Or the pool of people polled is off. 521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat. Which would explain the results. Despite Clinton’s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her. Regardless of these apparent “winning” results, as Donald Trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. That he should have brought up Bill Clinton’s infidelity. Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. Which is odd considering he apparently won. With the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds. Let’s not forget that Julian Assange promised a few months back an October surprise release on Wikileaks that would destroy Hillary Clinton’s campaign. We all must wait and see. 
Anyone who has ever struggled with some kind of addiction knows that it is not easy to break the habit. Whether you’re addicted to nicotine, alcohol, meth or crack, even being 24-hours sober seems like a monumental achievement. One woman, an ex-heroin addict, showed Reddit what happens when you decide to turn your life around and free yourself from the clutches of addiction. You can’t argue with the results, either.  Addiction is a mental, physical, emotional and spiritual event, for want of a better term. Getting sober is tough for that very reason, but it’s necessary for the well-being of everyone involved, meaning the family and friends of the addict, as well as the addict themselves. The woman in question began a downward spiral into heroin addiction after her abusive boyfriend convinced her that it would make her feel better about the problems in her life, including losing custody of her daughter. She says that after 8 months of daily use and several failed attempts at getting sober, she finally told the judge in the case that she wanted to get clean. She was found in contempt of court and went to jail for 36 days before heading to rehab. As you can see in her mugshot, this woman – who is unnamed – was feeling the physical and emotional affects of her disease. When she finally became dedicated to getting clean, her whole life changed, as is evidenced in this “after” picture, where she is 826 days sober, and counting.  She added the following to the end of her Reddit post: ‘There are other addicts out there who are in the same circle of hell that I was in in that mug shot. So even if one of those people see this and get their sh*t together, then it was worth it.’ If you or someone you know is struggling with any kind of addiction, please know that it is okay to seek out help for them. You’re not intruding on their lives and while they may be furious with you for a period of time, they will come to see that you did what you had to do to make their lives better. There is no reason that someone should have to suffer from addiction for one more day. 
This is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Anything with ‘Clinton’ in it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many Africans. They distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this… the question is, did the Clintons know about it. I’m betting that they did. Ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The DOJ also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. So, one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this. “This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.  From The Daily Caller: Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. “The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF. This could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves. Right when they need it least. A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC. What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundation’s aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs. But that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. All for money. ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the US Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.” “Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the DCNF. Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are banned in the US, but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide. The Clinton Foundation and Clinton’s charity have not severed ties with them either. Companies that partner with The Clinton Foundation and charities make a ton of money. Corruption is rampant. Bill and Hillary Clinton obviously care nothing about black people or humans in general… their primary interest is monetary.  
If you want to watch a conservative throw a temper tantrum just mention slavery and grab your popcorn. Because when First Lady Michelle Obama talked about slavery and the great progress our country has made since the Civil War during an interview at the new Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of African American History and Culture, conservatives took to Twitter to whine. Mrs. Obama told host Robin Roberts about how she feels about visiting the museum, which opens this weekend. And one of the things that struck her the most is the fact that a lot of the history the museum presents happened during the lives of the three generations of her family who visited the museum that day. And she expressed astonishment at how fast progress has been made. “When you think about the fact that my great-great grandfather was a slave and today I live in the White House, that progress is huge and it’s fast,” the First Lady said. Here’s the video via Twitter. FLOTUS: “My great-great grandfather was a slave and today I live in the White House. That progress is huge.” https://t.co/A4RwUHYR5z pic.twitter.com/vvhgrtxoYu — ABC News (@ABC) September 23, 2016  But, of course, conservatives lost their shit and displayed their hatred in the comments. @ABC And the sooner that Mooch and Obummer get out of the White house and Trump gets in, the better! #TrumpPence16 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain — Chantie Huffines (@LadyChantie) September 23, 2016  @ABC But, you keep the narrative going that all white people, except Clintons, are racist. — Deporable & watsit2u (@thumbug) September 23, 2016  @ABC The country is more racist than ever since The Obamas entered the White House. They have a bitter resentment for White People — Mike Van Patten (@MikeVanPatten4) September 23, 2016  @ABC So why are the democrats trying to send race relations back to the sixties? — Deplorable Voter (@Antone18) September 23, 2016  @ABC Keep driving racial segregation down our throats, ABC.

The two parties have flipped since then. Democrats have since become the defenders of Civil Rights who continue to fight for racial equality and social justice while Republicans pandered to white racists in the South and have become dominated by white supremacists who desperately want to roll back any and all progress African-Americans have made in this country. If Republicans have to go back 150 years to find one good thing the party did for African-Americans that’s really embarrassing and says a lot about what the party has become. 
From the Daily Caller News Foundation: A total of 205 Clinton Foundation donors whose corporations and foundations collectively contributed $216 million since 2009, were awarded the most coveted invitations in the nation’s capital: prestigious seats at one or more White House State Dinners, according to a Daily Caller News Foundation investigation. At least 15 of the Clinton Foundation’s corporate donors — representing $47 million in contributions — were able to win invitations to two or more official state dinners. Significantly, the decision makers who authorized the special invitations were not at the White House at all, but were ensconced in the Department State’s Office of Protocol. The protocol office, chosen by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, are filled solely with long-time Clinton loyalists. Despite the Democratic presidential nominee’s departure from the Department of State in 2013, all of the top officeholders in the protocol office throughout Obama’s two terms have been senior staffers who served in either former President Bill Clinton’s White House or in Hillary’s Senate and 2008 presidential campaigns. Critics of the foundation worry Dennis Cheng — who served as Clinton’s protocol deputy chief and later went directly to the Clinton Foundation as its chief fundraiser — could have “walked away” with valuable donor lists compiled by the office. After Cheng left the Department of State, he raised a record quarter billion dollars while at the foundation. He is now Hillary’s national fundraiser, leading her presidential bid to raise $2 billion. As a result, The Daily Beast once called him, “Hillary Clinton’s $2 billion money man.” If Cheng shared confidential information with the foundation, he may have violated a special “Memorandum of Understanding” (MOU) signed by the foundation and the Obama transition team in November 2008. The MOU warned of avoiding “potential or actual conflict of interest.” Cheng also could run afoul of a 18 USC 208, a federal statute that “prohibits an executive branch employee from participating personally and substantially in a particular Government matter that will affect his own financial interests,” including those of a prospective employer or a family member. “How much of the mailing list and contact information Cheng got at Protocol, migrated over to the Clinton Foundation,” asked Charles Ortel a Wall Street investor and an outspoken critic of the Clinton Foundation. “We don’t yet how much of this extraordinarily valuable contact information as it walked out the front door either in Dennis Cheng’s personal cell phone, or on a contact list that might have been emailed.” he said in an interview with TheDCNF. Neither the foundation nor Hillary’s presidential campaign responded to inquiries about potential conflicts of interest surrounding Cheng. Bill boasted in a Tuesday CNN interview that foundation donors never benefited from any Department of State action, asserting, “to the best of my knowledge, nobody ever got anything from the State Department because they supported the Clinton Foundation.” Yet, official White House dinners are among the most glamorous and exclusive venues in Washington, D.C., and the competition to secure an invitation is fierce. Guests not only can mingle with a head of state and their closest advisors, but they also offer privileged access to the president, top White House staff and many cabinet members. Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova, who prosecuted corruption cases in Washington, D.C., told TheDCNF the White House dinners weren’t only benefits, but amounted to the “selling of access.” “The obvious connection between donations and access to big, White House state dinners is very important,” he said in an interview with TheDCNF.  “It was clearly a reward to donors, something they got as a result of giving money to the Clinton Foundation,” he stated. DiGenova was U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia and was appointed an Independent Counsel concerning the Clinton passport disclosure case. “We are looking into Cheng’s relationship between the State Department and the foundation and the political donor class,” former U.S. Attorney Matthew Whitaker told TheDCNF. Whitaker is the executive director of the ethics watchdog group, the Foundation for Accountability & Civic Trust (FACT). “Cheng is the person in the middle of this situation. He had substantial input as to who was invited, who got seated where,” he said. “I would say Cheng’s a key figure — really a shadowy figure — in this whole thing,” Whitaker added. “It’s very obvious to me that people were giving to the foundation, not only because they perceived they could get access to the State Department, but it now appears they were giving in order to get access to State Dinners at the White House,” he told TheDCNF. FACT has been trying to obtain the email traffic between Cheng and the Clinton Foundation under the Freedom of Information Act. The group initially filed an FOIA request in February 2015, but Department of State officials are refusing to release any of the emails before the presidential election. “They have been stonewalling us and not responsive and now they’re telling us that we probably won’t get it until mid-to-late November,” Whitaker said. He served as the US Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa from 2004-2009. The protocol office has been stacked from the very beginning with Clinton veterans. When Cheng served as deputy chief of the protocol office, his boss was Chief Capricia Marshall who, at age 32, served as the White House social secretary for Hillary when Bill was president. After Cheng left in 2011, his replacement was Natalie Jones, who was Hillary’s Mid-Atlantic finance director for her 2008 presidential bid. Jones was joined by Mark Walsh, Hillary’s LGBT “outreach director” from her 2008 campaign. Peter Selfridge succeeded Marshall in June 2014 as the chief of protocol and is the current head of the office. He served in the scheduling and advance office at former President Bill Clinton’s White House. One of the most revealing illustration of Cheng’s continuing contact with the the protocol office after he joined the Clinton Foundation is in email exchanges. In a March 8, 2012 email from Marshall to Jones, Cheng and Hillary’s deputy chief of staff, Huma Abedin, the chief happily identifies foundation donors who were to attend the March 14, 2012 state dinner for British Prime Minister David Cameron. “Invited to state dinner,” Marshall informed the group. Two of those invited included Clinton Democratic fundraiser Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who gave between $100,000 to $250,000, and Fred Eychaner, who committed $25 million to the foundation. “Nice,” replies Abedin. Although the 2008 MOU explicitly sought to build a wall between the foundation and Clinton’s official business, Cheng felt it was appropriate to later invite Abedin to a Clinton Foundation dinner that included foreign nationals. In a June 11, 2012 email, he urges Abedin to come to Little Rock for the dinner. “Attached is list of attendees for tomorrow night’s Clinton Foundation dinner,” he wrote Abedin. Among those attending was Recep Ozkan, a Turkish national who donated between $500,000 to $1 million to the Clinton Foundation. Ozkan was the liaison for Fethullah Gulen, a secretive Turkish cleric who allegedly was behind the failed July 15 coup attempt against the Turkish government of President Recep Erdogan. Erdogan filed papers with the U.S. government seeking the extradition of Gulen, according to Tuesday reports. Also attending the dinner was Victor Pinchuk, the Ukrainian tycoon who married the daughter of Ukrainian strongman Leonid Kuchma, who was considered a corrupt leader during his years in office. The email was obtained by Citizens United, a conservative group, under the Freedom of Information Act. One of the most notorious Clinton Foundation donors to attend a White House dinner was Rajat Gupta, a long-time personal friend of Bill’s who was convicted of insider trading. He served two years in a federal penitentiary. Gupta was the first foreign-born managing director at McKinsey & Company and reportedly hired Chelsea Clinton for her first job. Without any experience, he paid her a six figure salary. Gupta attended the dinner for the Indian Prime Minister in 2009. Ortel claims the pattern of awarding government perks to donors began in the 1990s during Bill’s first term at the White House.  At the time, Clinton and his aides rented out the Lincoln Bedroom to 66 campaign contributors and offered seats on Air Force One to 56 contributors. “To see the pattern, you really have to go back to when they were in control of the White House, the first time and they clearly demonstrated the propensity to rent out the Lincoln bedroom, to sell seats on Air Force One,” Ortel told TheDCNF. “So this was an old game.” Rep. Marsha Blackburn, the Tennessee Republican congresswoman who is vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and leading a congressional investigation into the Clinton Foundation, told TheDCNF, “This is further evidence of the Clinton’s ‘Pay to Play’ mentality. The State Dinners provide incredible opportunities to meet our government’s highest ranking officials and Clinton Foundation donors were able to get special access simply because they stroked a check.” “The quid pro quo is astonishing and it begs the question of whether the Clintons are beneath selling anything,” Blackburn charged. Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs’ chairman and CEO, attended one of the hottest state dinners — a January 19, 2011 White House State Dinner for former Chinese President Hu Jintao. His company donated $1 to $5 million to the foundation, and its Goldman Philanthropy Fund gave an additional $250,000 to $500,000, according to the Clinton Foundation website. But that wasn’t the only contributions to Bill and Hillary. The company also gave the couple $2.25 million for 12 speeches before Goldman Sachs venues. Brian Moynihan, Bank of America’s CEO and chairman, attended the May 19, 2010 state dinner toasting Felipe Calderon, Mexico’s former president. The Bank of America Foundation donated between $500,000 to $1 million to the Clinton Foundation, and the Bank of America Corporation contributed between $100,000 to $250,000. But Bank of America also paid more than $1 million for four speeches to both Bill and Hillary. The Clinton Foundation donors invited to more than one state dinner were: Honeywell, GE, Dreamworks, PepsiCo, Morgan Stanley, Coca Cola, Dow, Boeing, Intel, UPS, Comcast, IBM and the Blackstone Group. Microsoft and the Ford Foundation were invited to three state dinners. J.T. Mastranadi, political director of the Citizens United, said his organization’s conclusion was, “regardless of where you happened to be employed at any given time – the Clinton State Department or the Clinton Foundation – the top priority was always donor maintenance.” TheDCNF contacted the Clinton Foundation and Hillary’s presidential campaign about a wide range of questions regarding the state dinners and the foundation. Neither responded. To see the full list of Clinton Foundation Donor attendees to all 12 White House State Dinners, click here.

The mainstream media got played today and it was wonderful. The Trump campaign released a statement last night saying their candidate believed Barack Obama was born in the United States, but they didn’t believe it. This morning the campaign announced that Trump will make a statement about the birther issue and they all rushed to his new DC hotel for the press conference. But Trump didn’t come out right away. First the press had to listen to (and in some cases televise) a series of Medal of Honor winners praising the GOP candidate.  And when they were all done Trump came out and said: “Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.” With that it was over. The press didn’t get to ask about Trump’s claims that Hillary’s campaign started it and he finished it…Trump was gone and it was great! Let’s get to the real issues. Did Hillary Clinton and/or her 2008 campaign start the birtherism and did Trump end it? The story is too long to complete in one post, therefore consider this Part 1, Birtherism’s Roots in Clinton Campaign There is no evidence that Hillary Clinton ever said publicly that she believes Barack Obama wasn’t a natural born citizen. But there is plenty of evidence that the birther hoax… Read the rest of the story at Jeff Dunetz’s blog The Lid  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.
What would you do if you were faced with an angry mob shutting down the stretch of road that you’re on? You approach the group and apply the brakes, wondering if they’ll move for you, but not only do they not make any effort to get out of your way, they start coming toward you. Remembering the Reginald Denny affair, you realize that you’re faced with two options: floor it and risk hurting one of the protesters, or stop and risk them hurting you, or worse.  What do you do? Maybe it was the way I was raised, but I learned that if you feel threatened and you feel as if it ultimately comes down to you or the person who you believe is planning to do you harm, the answer is absolutely, 100% self-preservation. Apparently, I’m not the only one with this set of beliefs. An incident took place on the campus of the Eastern Michigan University that proves that if you try to shut down a road in protest, you do so at your own risk. Watching the video below, you can see that black protesters have completely taken over the street. One small jeep, however, clearly has places to be that aren’t right there at that moment. The driver hits the gas pedal and speeds forward, bumping over a protester. Watch the video below:   In case you were wondering if they were upset about the Charlotte shooting, the answer is “no.” Instead, they were upset about the words “KKK” and “Leave N*****s” painted on the side of the school. The words were removed and the school issued an apology, but it was too late, BLM was outraged. Make no mistake, it’s better to be arrested for running over a protester than to be killed and/or have your property stolen by them because they think they’re entitled to it due to someone painting some mean words on the side of a building. “Better to be judged by 12 than carried by 6,” doesn’t only apply to protecting your home and family, but yourself as well. There is no good reason to stop while surrounded by irrationally angry people who just want violence to come to you and anyone else they deem “guilty” of whatever crime they’ve made up today. What would you do if you were in this situation? Would you stop, or would you put the pedal to the floor? 
Hillary Clinton just called out the fact that Donald Trump cheered for the housing crisis in anticipation of its collapse – which is absolutely true. Trump told The Globe and Mail in March of 2007: “People have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I’m excited if it is. I’ve always made more money in bad markets than in good markets.” In fact, Trump thought the housing crisis was much-ado-do about nothing for high-end investments, and told investors: “I don’t see the subprime problems affecting the higher-end stuff…In fact, he is advising investors that there are now great deals in buying subprime mortgages at a discount and repossessed houses at low prices.” Of course, on one level, Trump wasn’t wrong­­—in that the subprime crisis affected mostly poorer Americans who lost their homes and jobs and the ability to support their families. The collapse of home prices caused by the housing bubble cost roughly seven million Americans more than $7 trillion in equity during the Great Recession. This recession most severely impacted low-income folks – people who are burdened with payments in excess of 50 percent of their income – Trump’s response is just “That’s called business.”
Itâs no secret that Bill Maher, comedian extraordinaire and host of HBOâsÂ is no fan of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. So, of course he couldnât resist live tweeting the entire first general election presidential debate between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The whole thing was one brilliant insult against Trump after another. Here are a few of the better tweets: GOP won expectations game when it nominated an orangutan. As long as he doesn't fling his poop, "Surprisingly dignified Trump last night" â Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016  Want to see Hillary come out and say "The Russians just handed me your tax returns" just to see if Trump bolts â Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016  Trump adjusting his Spanx right now, and one final pass with the can of Final Netâ¦ â Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016  Trump proud of himself that he called her "Secretary Clinton" â as opposed to what, Bitchula? â Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016  Trump. Wearing a tie made in China, just sayin' â Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016  OK,I hope she's playing rope-a-dope, and I do mean dope, because I'm getting tired of this vile nincompoop bullying and lieing and its early â Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016  Trump: "Being in Iraq was a disaster, but we shld take the oil"WE WLD HAVE TO BE BACK IN IRAQ TO TAKE THE OIL! They won't give it to a drone â Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016  btw, you know a charge agst Trump is 100% provably true when he interrupts with "Wrong!" #debates â Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016  And, of course, for his closers, Maher had to do what heâs been doing on his show ever since it became clear who the nominees would be, and hit those who refuse to vote for Hillary: However this comes out, I have so little respect for the electorate just that its this close. She's right, she shld be 50 points ahead. â Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016  But he definitely saved his best line for last, as he called Trump his favorite phrase: Negative ads in a political race are "not nice?" There's no crying in politics, you #WhinyLittleBitch! â Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016  Letâs face it, no matter how Trumpâs surrogates try to spin this â and they are already out in force doing their damndest â he lost this thing tonight, badly. He made an absolute fool of himself. Thereâs just no way around it. Of course, his uneducated core supporters will still vote for him, but thereâs no way this one got the undecided voters into Trumpâs corner. The one thing tonight did do, though, is give us plenty of entertainment. 
There’s a lot being said about football players across the NFL standing together in unity against police brutality. This is even more pertinent now, as even more black men have been gunned down in the street just this week by police. Using his press conference to bring further awareness to this topic was none other than Seattle Seahawks’ star cornerback Richard Sherman. He said: “I’m not going to answer any questions today, and it’s no offense to you guys, but the state of things in the world today is very interesting. I think you have players that are trying to take a stand and be aware of social issues and try to make a stand and increase people’s awareness and put a spotlight on it and they’re being ignored. Whether they’re taking a knee or whether they’re locking arms, you know, they’re trying to bring people together and united them for a cause. And I think that the last couple days a couple more guys have gotten shot and killed in the middle of the street and more videos have come out of guys getting killed, and I think people are still missing the point. The reason these guys are kneeling. The reason we’re locking arms is to bring people together. To make people aware that this is not right. You know, it’s not right for people to get killed in the street.” Sherman then explains how he’s been proactive in the community and even needing to go so far as to train young people of color on how to behave with the police, but still being fearful that they might get shot. He says, “that’s an unfortunate time to be living.” Especially when people are being killed for no reason. He then has some choice words by those who are supposedly offended by those standing up against police brutality by quietly using their First Amendment right of dissent and protest to bring awareness to the plight. Sherman says: “When a guy takes a knee, you can ignore it. You can say he’s not being patriotic. He’s not honoring the flag. I’m doing none of those things. I’m saying straight up, this is wrong and we need to do something.” And something most certainly needs to be done, and done now. Watch Sherman speak here: Wow— this is a must-watch.

The story of how a group of black clubgoers were turned away at the door of a club is going viral. Ashley Ellis Sisco and a group of friends attempted to visit the Kandy Bar in Charlotte, North Carolina. They were turned away at the door and told they needed a membership to get in, but a group of white girls behind them told them that wasn’t the case. The bouncers, clearly racially profiling, allowed the white girls to enter while Sisco filmed them turning away a black man with dreads. Sisco later posted in the comments that “the sad thing is that we all work in public service. It was a group of nurses, teachers, bankers people who serve the community and work with every race and ethnicity without judgement….and we have to go back into the community we serve and be treated like trash.” It is clear that in North Carolina, a state where support for the Confederacy still is very strong, racism is still a major part of their identity, and this kind of display of casual racism makes it clear how Donald Trump is so popular in this country. 
Legendary singer Barbara Streisand penned an op-ed for the Huffington Post today in which she paints a distinct portrait between Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, disparaging the mandarin mogul for his cowardice and bigotry while praising the former Secretary of State for her strength and resolve. He’s basically a bully, but like all bullies, he’s a coward at heart. He skipped out on a debate because he didn’t like the moderator. He can’t handle the tough questions. He’s so thin-skinned that as soon as anyone challenges him, he sues them. Hillary has been attacked right and left for decades and is still standing. She has negotiated with leaders around the world to keep us safe from nuclear threat because it would destroy the planet… while he shockingly said, “If we have nuclear weapons, why can’t we use them?” And he has the nerve to call her “trigger-happy”? “Unstable”? His ignorance is astounding. Streisand then touches on the undercurrent of sexism that has dogged the Clinton campaign and her entire political career, rightfully pointing out that old white men are deeply suspicious of powerful women, afraid they will be treated the way that they treat women. So how come Hillary is not getting credit for all her accomplishments? It goes back to something I’ve felt for many years…strong women, powerful women have always been suspect. Some men are challenged by strong women… afraid of them… and some women are jealous of them. Strong women have too many opinions for some people… they prefer women who are quiet. They want us to speak less and smile more. After Hillary answered questions on national security, Reince Priebus complained that she didn’t smile enough. Well, guess what… there was nothing to smile about. As she said, this is serious business. And Trump says Hillary doesn’t look presidential? What does that mean… coming from a guy who looks like a raccoon in a tanning bed… with a flying squirrel on his head? That’s what a president is supposed to look like? A wrestler who dies his hair blonde? Republicans play dirty and their smear tactics unfortunately work. As they say, “If you repeat a lie long enough and loud enough, people will believe it.” And that’s what’s happening and it’s terrifying. We can’t allow ourselves to be swiftboated again. We can’t let that happen to Hillary… a woman who has the temperament and the experience to be president… unlike Donald Trump, whose idea of foreign policy was bringing the Miss Universe pageant to Russia. How can you support a man who says, “Women… you have to treat them like sh—“ and believes such hateful things about 51 percent of the American population? We cannot allow America to fall into the hands of a narcissist who has shown no regard for anyone but himself… a bigoted and misogynist reality-TV character with no political experience and no qualms about lying loudly and often. There is NO equivalency between these two candidates. Only Hillary Clinton has the skills, the knowledge, the temperament and the compassion to lead this nation. She’s absolutely right. Donald Trump is the complete opposite of everything our nation stands for, while Hillary Clinton embodies leadership and strength in an obvious way that must make Trump feel like a chump with tiny hands.
Reince Priebus openly threatened Kasich and other Republicans that they better blindly support Donald Trump or face the end of their careers. John Kasich doesnât give a shit about Priebusâ pathetic threats. On Sunday, the GOP Chair suggested that Republicans who donât fall in line behind Trump could be severely punished in their endeavors to seek election or re-election. âThose people need to get on board,â Priebus told : âAnd if theyâre thinking theyâre going to run again someday, I think that weâre going to evaluate the process â of the nomination process and I donât think itâs going to be that easy for them. In order to be on the ballot in South Carolina, you actually have to pledge your support to the nominee, no matter who that person is. So whatâs the penalty for that? Itâs not a threat, but thatâs just the question that we have a process in place.â Kasich has repeatedly refused to endorse Donald Trump and did not take kindly to Priebusâ threat, issuing a brutal response through his spokesman John Weaver. âThankfully, there are still leaders in this country who put principles before politics. The idea of a greater purpose beyond oneself may be alien to political party bosses like Reince Priebus, but it is at the center of everything Governor Kasich doesâ¦The Governor is traveling the nation supporting down ballot Republicans and preventing a potential national wipeout from occurring on Reinceâs watch.â Weaver also added that Priebus should be thanking Kasich. So the next time John Kasich seeks re-election or high office itâs going to be interesting to watch how Priebus responds. Will he follow through on his threat or will he do an about-face and all of a sudden support Kasich? Threatening someone with political ruin just because they donât support the terrible choice of nominee your party made sounds more like what dictators or fascists do. Itâs definitely not the hallmark of a party that supposedly supports our democracy. Because by trying to force Republicans to vote a certain way, they are undermining democracy and all the values this country was founded upon. If anyone deserves political backlash, itâs Reince Priebus. He created a political atmosphere so toxic that they now have Trump as their leader. The Republicans standing against Trump are the sane ones. 
Hillary Clinton was almost universally declared the winner of tonight’s debate by the mainstream media, but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise. The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States. The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon – thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016  What’s curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from – which will come as quite a surprise:  Data is from Trendsmap.com That’s right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advance Putin’s agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya. It’s a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putin’s trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences. Putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe. The Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: “humourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.” So remember – don’t trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. It might be a Russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.   
Elizabeth Warren’s epic takedown of Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf may be her finest moment yet. Stumpf, who is being pressured to resign from his post in the wake of a massive scandal involving the bank’s intentional fleecing of millions of customers, was just thoroughly embarrassed during a senate hearing. Every time Stumpf tried to deflect Warren’s questions, she interjected and refused to let him off the hook. Throughout her line of questioning, she used the Wells Fargo mission statement and Stumpf’s own words to shame him.  WARREN: “Since this massive, years-long scam came to light, you have said, repeatedly, ‘I am accountable.’ But what have you actually done to hold yourself accountable? Have you resigned as CEO or chairman of Wells Fargo? STUMPF: “The board I serve– WARREN: “Have you resigned?” STUMPF: “No, I have not.” WARREN: “Alright. Have you returned one nickel of the millions of dollars you were paid while this scam was going on?” STUMPF: “Well, first of all, this was by one percent of our people, and–” WARREN: “That’s not my question. It’s about responsibility. Have you returned one nickel of the millions of dollars that you were paid while this scam was going on?” STUMPF: “The, the board will take care of that.” WARREN: “Have you returned one nickel of the money you earned while this scam was going on?” STUMPF: “And, and the board will do–” WARREN: “I’ll take that as a no, then. And have you fired a single senior executive, and by that, I don’t mean a regional manager or branch manager. I’m asking about the people who actually led your community banking division or your compliance division.” STUMPF: “We’ve made a change in our regional, to lead our regional bank.” WARREN: “I just said I’m not talking about regional managers, I’m not asking about branch managers. I’m asking if you have fired senior management. The people who actually led the community banking division, who oversaw this fraud, or the compliance division who was in charge of making sure that the bank complied with the law. Did you fire any of those people?” STUMPF: “No.” WARREN: “No. OK. So you haven’t resigned. You haven’t returned a single nickel of your personal earnings. You haven’t fired a single senior executive. Instead, evidently, your definition of ‘accountable’ is to push the blame to your low-level people who don’t have the money for a fancy PR firm to defend themselves. It’s gutless leadership.” Wells Fargo was fined nearly $200 million by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau earlier this month for perpetuating an ongoing scam of opening accounts and credit cards on behalf of customers without their knowledge or consent, then proceeding to fine those customers late fees and overdraft charges in order to drive sales numbers higher. As of this writing, CEO and chairman John Stumpf has not been criminally charged for his bank’s actions.        
In the wake of the recent rioting and looting in NC, officers at one Charlotte police station were in for a heck of a shock when a little black boy came stumbling into the station totally unannounced. Even before the child had a chance to speak a word, one officer quickly called over her fellow officers in the station and rushed towards the boy. The horrifying episode for this young boy all started when he was woken up by sirens and helicopters from outside during the riots on Tuesday. The riots were happening just outside the boy's window, but naturally he was completely unaware of why any of this was happening, or even what was really happening. The next day, on the way to school, the boy's mother, Deanna Hooker was playing the radio and the two heard a news report about how several officers were injured in the rioting and attacks. Deanna had no idea how much the riots and news of the injured officers had really affected her son. After seeing so much hate in the news in and his surrounding community Deanna was rather surprised to hear her son's idea. The boy thought about the riots for days and the impact that they had on him and continued to have on him. He wanted to make an impact himself for those who risk their lives to keep him safe. "He asked me if he could bring the police donuts and give them hugs for all they do," Deanna's Facebook post read that was later shared by Love What Matters.  With a little help from his mom he was able to carry out this very kind and meaningful gesture. He wore a sign around his neck that read, "Free hugs," and carried in a big donut box. Deanna's son walked into the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department and gave the officers his two gifts. He didn't just tell one officer about how he felt, he made sure to go around to every single officer to tell them how he felt about the service they do for him and his mother. "It is amazing how much children can teach us during times like this," Deanna's post said about her amazing son. This mom should be proud of her son for having such a steady view in such a chaotic world. She deserves some credit as well for having instilled such great values in her amazing son.

Police brutality has never truly left America’s national conversation, but it had taken a back seat to the presidential election circus until video showed Tulsa police shooting and killing Terence Crutcher in cold blood. It was all too much for one small town Ohio police chief, and his moving words have started gone viral on social media according to PINAC News: But Middletown Police Chief Rodney Muterspaw said he could not remain silent after watching Tulsa police officer Betty Shelby shoot and kill Terence Crutcher, tweeting the following message Tuesday, which has been retweeted almost 6,000 times as of this writing. The video showing an Oklahoma cop shoot and kill Terence Crutcher after he had his hands in the air, only to later claim he was not complying, is so outrageous that even an Ohio police chief took to social media to voice his disgust. And that is something we never see. According to local media in his hometown of Middleton, Chief Muterspaw wrote on his Facebook page that if police officers “can’t do the job or are scared of people different than you, then get out of the job. You are making us all look bad. STOP.” “It could be us tomorrow,” Muterspaw told the Journal-News. “You have to look at it. It’s not second-guessing anybody. It’s training for us. It’s a chance to learn from it. We are not robots. We have an opinion too. If it makes our department better and keeps our officers safer, if it makes the city better we should speak out about it.” He said Middletown officers have removed 137 weapons from suspects this year without firing their guns. Then he went onto twitter and fired off a pair of tweets heard round the world. Here’s the Chief’s two public tweets, which were embedded into PINAC News’ story before he took his account private after gaining national attention:  The message isn’t resonating in Tulsa, where officers have stuck to their hokum story that Terence Crutcher tried to reach into his car window for a gun – even though a video shows clearly that the window was closed. Now officers are trying to slander Crutcher claiming that it’s all a drug related issue, an obvious attempt to discredit their dead victim – which curiously, they hadn’t tried to do until his killing gained national attention. In any case, we don’t recall drug posession carrying the death penalty in United States of America, or the suspension of his right to a fair trial. Now Department of Justice officials are going to investigate the Tulsa officer who killed Crutcher, and with any luck field criminal charges against the cop whose story has frequently changed to desperately try and justify her lethal actions. Chief Muterspaw’s impassioned call to the professionalism of police, to empathy in their daily life and his commitment to less violent policing is a lesson that one good cop won’t spoil the bunch. Sadly, this is newsworthy because he’s quite possibly the only high ranking police official in America who is (or was) openly siding with Americans, and siding with citizens right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
There’s a lot that could be discussed about last night’s debate, like the unfair debate moderator asking questions to help Hillary, but that’s not the main concern right now. There is one thing that has baffled many…. Hillary didn’t appear to be her usually stupid coughing self! She was so ready with answers and detailed facts. Almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water. This is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking! The latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear…is that an earpiece she is wearing? Or just something fashionable for old ladies? Twitter may have figured out the answer…do you see it?  It certainly wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Could it be a trick of light and shadows? A puffy zipper, perhaps? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her hideous feminist pantsuit?  Hillary Clinton’s campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece. Fox News reported that “Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said what is seen in the photo is merely a reflection of the TV lights or a flash.” While we aren’t sure what was going on inside Hillary’s little head last night, we do have a very interesting email posted by Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that the WikiLeaks archive released, “Did u take your earpiece or do I need to get it?”  Woods had a hidden sense of humor that escaped him on twitter…“She can’t even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece.”  Then Woods added: “She literally can’t help herself. She’s the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial.” Of course, we don’t have actual proof of the earpiece, it could have just been a hearing aid. Hmmm no one has talked about Hillary wearing an earpiece in the past when she fumbled through her speeches. Some claim it’s merely a reflection of studio lights. We’ll let you be the judge. 
We’ve all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. One of the most famous is probably “read my lips…no new taxes,” a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat: .@JasonMillerinDC: Statement on Last Weekend’s Terror Attacks https://t.co/DZlIvkcHmB pic.twitter.com/l3EVTvLcfO — Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 19, 2016  Take a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. He didn’t promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil. Let’s imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. “Destroy” doesn’t leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty “yeeeeehaw,” the reality is that he’s talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America. He’s talking about profiling Muslims. He’s talking about Donald Trump’s version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an American citizen with the right to due process. Just because he’s a suspect in a bombing doesn’t mean he’s guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked “kill” and not on the most wanted list. There’s nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play. What that means is that under Trump’s dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think I’m being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isn’t about the narrative. It isn’t about prevention or education. It’s about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening. The only solace we have is that what he’s promising is nothing but another “read my lips.” Terrorism isn’t something you can simply “destroy” just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn’t going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trump’s campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons. Featured image from file
While presidential nominees Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton may be neck-and-neck in poll numbers, the Republican candidate has been overwhelmingly winning in rally attendance and momentum. On Monday, Trump packed an Estero, Florida, arena with an estimated 8,000 people inside and more outside, despite the sweltering 90-degree weather, the Fort Myers News-Press reported. Meanwhile, on the same day in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Clinton’s speech at Temple University drew fewer than 200 people, according to Politico reporter Michael Grunwald. Clinton’s event was supposed to attract millennial voters — people she desperately needs if she wants to be victorious in November, according to WCAU. But photos and reports from the event showed that the few millennials who actually showed up to the event weren’t exactly enthused about it. Fox News contributor Jesse Watters posted a photo to social media that showed the true “vibe” of the Clinton event:  So this is the vibe at the Hillary Clinton "rally" right now… #imwithher #turnup A photo posted by Jesse Watters (@jessewatters) on Sep 19, 2016 at 9:11am PDT  It’s hard to tell who was more excited about hearing Clinton speak — the young woman or the fire extinguisher. The GOP candidate also noted the vast differences between his and his Democrat rival’s campaign crowds in recent weeks. “I can say this, when Hillary comes in, she has very small crowds,” Trump said. The Republican businessman, by contrast, has had no trouble packing large arenas, stadiums and other locations for his campaign events — a great sign in the weeks leading up to the November election. On Sept. 9, the Trump campaign held a rally in Pensacola that drew 12,000 people, according to WTSP. The Estero crowd was nearly as impressive with its 8,000 people, particularly when compared to Clinton’s recent South Florida event that attracted a much smaller 1,500 person crowd, the Tampa Bay Times reported.

Hillary can put a few kids in the rafters but there are still less than 200 people here. pic.twitter.com/IVXWS9dezm — Michael Grunwald (@MikeGrunwald) September 19, 2016  The turnout of supporters to these campaign events is indicative of how well Trump has been reaching and convincing voters to support his candidacy, while Clinton seems to be struggling at the worst possible time.

A 22-year-old Muslim man from Afghanistan proudly declared that he was a superstar in Afghanistan after he sodomized and orally raped a 2-year-old boy. The worst part is that he was only charged with sexual assault and only sentenced to two years in prison. The UK’s Express reports: Jama B., 22, showed no remorse as he was sentenced to just two years and four months behind bars on the milder charge of sexual abuse of the four-year-old boy at the centre in Boostedt, Schleswig-Holstein. The toddler, from Iraq, was lured into a toilet cubicle at the home in March this year. The court heard the Afghani forced his penis into the child’s mouth. Afterwards the distraught youngster was returned to his father with his trousers down around his ankles. During the trial Jama B. boasted: “I’m a superstar in Afghanistan, a singer.” … Judge Stefan Becker refused to comment on the verdict but Peter Boysen, the lawyer who represented the family of the child, said: “it was a one-off act that did not take very long and hopefully will not have harmful long-term effects on the child. “Therefore there is no reason to complain, even if the sentence could have been maybe half a year longer. I have not therefore advised the parents to appeal against the verdict. He’s better again, the boy, but is still in therapeutic treatment of a child and adolescent psychiatrist. Jama showed absolutely no remorse for his crime. A second man, Sohrab S., 29, allegedly stood guard outside the toilet during the assault, which was really rape. He was acquitted for lack of evidence. Prosecutor Axel Bieler said, “Rape charges are brought only if it was enforced with violence or the threat of violence. We do not assume this was the case. “Therefore he was indicted on a charge of serious sexual abuse. The penalty doesn’t matter – it is between two and 15 years in jail for rape or for serious sexual abuse.” Say what? How about the fact that it was forced and that it was upon a child? What kind of mind does Axel Bieler have? I can tell you it is not a critically thinking judicial mind for sure. Karin Witt is not better. The spokeswoman of the Kiel court said, “The court found no reasons for an increased penalty, such as for example a criminal record for the accused. “The fact that he was under the influence of alcohol and the high sensitivity towards detention of the offender were both factors in the sentence,” she added. “He is young, knows no German and has already been attacked in pre-trial detention. The victim has also dealt well with the experience of what happened to him and there are no serious consequences to be expected.” What’s even worse is the comments by the family’s attorney. “It was a one-off act that did not take very long and hopefully will not have harmful long-term effects on the child,” Peter Boysen said. “Therefore there is no reason to complain, even if the sentence could have been maybe half a year longer. I have not therefore advised the parents to appeal against the verdict. He’s better again, the boy, but is still in therapeutic treatment of a child and adolescent psychiatrist. Really, Mr. Boysen? How about if this was your little boy? Would you still have the same cold-hearted response at this crime? I think not. Germans were outraged at the charges and the sentencing. “The incredible verdict of the prosecutor and the court,” wrote the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.  “This is the verdict that shames you all.” People continuing to make excuses for criminal sexual crimes, especially for those who are most innocent among us are a part of the larger problem. Allowing the foreign god of Islam in what was once a Christian country is problematic enough. Excusing the pagans that practice the ideology of Muhammad and engaging in these kinds of crimes is just adding fuel to the fire. Don’t think it won’t be happening in the united States either. Our own military kicked out Sgt. Charles Martlandfor defending a boy that was raped in Afghanistan and told other members of our military to keep silent about such abuses. Do you really think our representatives are going to stand up for the children when they’ve allowed them to be slaughtered by the millions? I think not. In a biblical society, this man would have been put to death, and rightly so.

This is a true story.  General Stanley McChrystal was the Commander of US Forces in Afghanistan and he had frequent disagreements on the conduct of the war with his Commander-in-Chief. At one point McChrystal was called into the Oval Office and he knew his Army career was about to be over. When former U.S. Military Commander in Afghanistan, Stanley McChrystal, was called into the Oval Office by Barack Obama, he knew things weren’t going to go well when the President accused him of not supporting him in his political role as President. “It’s not my job to support you as a politician, Mr. President, it’s my job to support you as Commander-in-Chief,” McChrystal replied, and he handed Obama his resignation.  Barack Obama has a long history of hating the US military and men and women who serve.  He is never one to let someone have the last word but he failed in this instance. Not satisfied with accepting McChrystal’s resignation the President made a cheap parting shot. “I bet when I die you’ll be happy to pee on my grave.” The General saluted. “Mr. President, I always told myself after leaving the Army I’d never stand in line again. Good job General McChrystal.  I’m pretty sure that after five or six years of being in the ground the line will have diminished enough so that you won’t have to stand in line.  You’re an honorable man, we know you wouldn’t cut in front of others.
A racist Georgia man went completely off the deep endÂ when faced with road work on his way home, threatening the construction crew with a gun while shoutingÂ racial slurs. Construction worker Nelson King said that on Thursday morning they were working on a section of road inÂ Coweta County.Â Harold Bishop was on his way home when he came upon the portion of the road that had been closed for construction. The 72-year-old man then proceeded to completely freak theÂ f*ck out and began waving around a gun while shouting racial epithets at the crew. âHe pulled up on us and he was like, âGet these N-word off the road, I live here, Iâll kill you N-word,ââ King recalled. When Bishop pulled out his gun for the second time, King decided to start recording the incident while another man working at the scene called 911. According to the Coweta County Sheriffâs Office, Bishop then left the scene but returned before police showed up. King said he decided to record the manâs threats so that he would have proof of what was happening. âIf I can show proof that he pulled the gun out,â said King, âpolice will get him.â It was a good thing King had decided to make theÂ video of Bishop threatening them with his gun because when police showed up they saw him throw a beer out of the window and smelled alcohol on him, but they could not find the weapon. Thatâs when King whipped out the proof. âI showed police the video and they seen the gun when he pointed it at us, they were like oh heâs got to go,â said King. Bishop has been charged withÂ charged with five counts of aggravated assault with a firearm, weapon pointing a gun at another, terroristic threats, DUI, and probation violation. He is currently being held without bond and is due in court on September 22. Watch more, here:  
Silicon Valley is afraid that their worst dreams will be realized if Donald Trump defeats Hillary Clinton in November. To bolster their cause they have jumped in to the registration process with some big bucks. We are talking millions. Company’s  like Facebook and Google are among the supporters of Hillary Clinton, and are totally involved supporting these liberal registration groups.  As Written By Joel B. Pollack for Breitbart:  The popular tech blog TechCrunch reported Monday that Silicon Valley giants are so worried about the rising prospects of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump that they are scrambling to find and fund ways to encourage more people to register to vote — presumably for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. In a story titled “Tech really wants to fix this election,” TechCrunch reporter Kate Conger reports that “tech companies from Google all the way down to small startups like Sam Altman’s VotePlz, which launched a million dollar registration sweepstakes today, are trying to” boost registration. Moreover, “although most claim to be nonpartisan,” Conger notes, “it’s clear that Donald Trump’s unusual campaign has ignited investors and pushed them to act.” She adds: VotePlz lets people check their voter registration status online, helps them register by guiding them through the online registration process or printing and mailing the registration form in states that require registration-by-mail, and gamifies the entire process with a leader-board that tracks how many friends have been referred by ……   Full Story Here: Report: Silicon Valley ‘Wants to Fix This Election’ – Breitbart
What is behind the News Media’s lack of coverage of recent terror attacks in our country? I learned of the recent bombings and stabbings from the post I read on the internet. You would think that this would be covered extensively by all of the Major News Networks, wouldn’t you? Perhaps these attacks have been caused by a video. I am sure Hillary Clinton would like you to believe that Donald Trump is personally responsible for the current bout of jihad in the USA. She has come awfully close to implying it. These attacks couldn’t be caused by Obama’s failed immigration policies Oh NO NO NO; the same policies that Hillary promises to administer full speed ahead. Perhaps the Media is downplaying these tragedies in order to prevent a shadow of blame being cast on Crooked Hillary. CNN, MSN, CBS, ABC, NBC, and even FOX would never ever be used as a propaganda machine to prop up Crooked Hillary, would they? What kind of DEPLORABLE person could doubt the credibility of today’s American Media? What happened to America? The news I watch today is twisted into propaganda resembling the propaganda that was dished out to citizens of the Soviet Union; they tell us twisted versions of the news containing enough grain of truth to fool the sheep. Bold faced lies. Anyone with half a brain should see right through it. 
Democratic President Barack Obama pulled off a historic diplomatic coup when he engineered an accord with Iran to freeze their nuclear program for ten years in exchange for lifting the sanctions that had been strangling their economy. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton engineered the tough economic sanctions that dragged Iran to the negotiating table after ex-Vice President Dick Cheney rebuffed their efforts at negotiation, convincing countries like China and Russia to act in unison with the United States and against their own short term business interests. It was a major diplomatic accomplishment and made our world safer. Did Trump just say US gave Iran $150 billion? Did I really hear that? — Arash Karami (@thekarami) September 27, 2016  Republican nominee Donald Trump keeps spewing complete fabrications about the  Iran accords which President Obama concluded at the start of this year. He started by repeating the lie Fox News planted about America paying $400 million dollars of Iran’s own cash back to them, at the conclusion of the agreements. It was money America owed Iran under a legal agreement. The State Department returned $400 million to the Iranian government, but it was money that we owed them. We didn’t “give” them anything. In the 1970s, the United States made a deal to sell $400 million of fighter jets to the Shah of Iran. The Shah paid upfront but was then deposed in the Iranian revolution, so the United States never delivered the jets. As part of the nuclear disarmament deal, the Iranian government simple wanted their money back if we weren’t going to cough up the jets. In Trump’s mind, that money inflated to $150 billion. Cash to paid to Iran as part of the lifting of sanctions rises from $400million to $1.5 billion to $150 billion according to Trump. #debates — Albert Rapacioli (@speedlinefoto) September 27, 2016  Bingo! Trump's Iran cash lie. Much debunked. — Sarah Reese Jones (@PoliticusSarah) September 27, 2016  Not only has the Republican nominee devoted most of his false statements about Iran to lying, he thinks it’s a great idea to start a needless war, with a country whose help we need to settle the disastrous Syrian Civil War. That’s when Hillary Clinton blew Trump out of the water for his empty threats about Iran which either look horrifically weak, or are calculated to start a war which would cost Americans dearly in blood and treasure, all to satisfy the outsize ego of a Republican that no sane voter should choose in November. #Debates2016 Clinton- Trump said he'd blow Iran boaters out of water & start another war. Trumps casual attitude about nuclear weapons. — Susan Maylone (@SusanMaylone) September 27, 2016  But Trump wasn’t content to leave a couple of lies alone, and went all the way out into his own Republican echo-chamber to land a Ben Carson sized fake zinger, claiming that North Korea is somehow controlled by Iran. Which is absurd. Trump: “Iran has power over North Korea.” What? #debates — Christina Wilkie (@christinawilkie) September 27, 2016 
The 2016 election is shaping up to be the weirdest (and nightmarish) election in decades. Up is down, night is day, and stupid is smart. Once Donald Trump became the nominee of a major party for the presidency, all existing and established norms went up in smoke. And the crazy is just getting started, so make sure you’ve got your passport handy. Politico writes that Former President George H.W. Bush is completely snubbing Donald Trump and plans to vote for Hillary Clinton in November. This revelation came from Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, the former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy. Kennedy announced the news on Facebook yesterday when she posted a picture  shaking hands next to Bush Sr with this caption: “The President told me he’s voting for Hillary!!” This is actually not very shocking when you consider how much the Bushes have shown their contempt for Trump, after ruining their chances of continuing their political dynasty with low-energy Jeb. Neither George Bush Sr. or George W. Bush showed up at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, and Jeb Bush has constantly let it be known that he has absolutely no intentions of voting for Trump. So perhaps this can be viewed as more of a repudiation of Trump than a glowing endorsement of Hillary. Former First Lady Laura Bush dropped a major bombshell in April of this year when she essentially indicated that she was supporting Hillary. Here’s what Laura Bush about the presidential race: “I want our next president – whoever he or she might be – to be somebody who is interested in women in Afghanistan and who will continue US policies… that we continue to do what we’re committed to do as a country,” she said, as she appeared on stage alongside her twin daughters Jenna and Barbara. “That’s who I want – or the kind of people that will do that and will pay attention to our history, and know what’s what’s happened before and know specifically how we can continue to do the good things that we do around the world.” Say what you will about George W. Bush–and there’s plenty–but his father was mostly a man of principle who put the country above petty politics. This is yet another reminder of how fractured the Republican Party has become.

The absolute legend and all-time great of professional basketball, Micheal Jordan, weighed in on the riots over police shootings in Charlotte. BlackLivesMatter may find it hard to see such a giant in the black community actually agree with common sense and stability, yes.  But they are especially going to have a difficult time choking down what he says and what he did to aid the police. “First, I want to express my condolences to the Scott family for their loss. I also wish for a full recovery to those who have been injured. In light of the tragic events of the past three days, it is more important than ever that we restore calm and come together, as a community, in peaceful demonstration and conversation, and in constructive and non-violent ways,” Jordan stated clearly. You see? He didn’t draw a line in the sand between points of view. He just drew a line between civil discourse and destructive anarchy, which is exactly what is going on with the George Soros funded BlackLivesMatter.  Jordan dove a little deeper into the conversation a bit early in a statement, in which he said “I was raised by parents who taught me to love and respect people regardless of their race or background, so I am saddened and frustrated by the divisive rhetoric and racial tensions that seem to be getting worse as of late. I know this country is better than that, and I can no longer stay silent. We need to find solutions that ensure people of color receive fair and equal treatment AND that police officers – who put their lives on the line every day to protect us all – are respected and supported,” Bravo! Bravo, Sir! That is the kind of wisdom that has held this society together for so long. Love one another. Serve one another. It really is that simple. It’s easy for an athlete celebrity to talk the talk…people are going to listen. But this is where Jordan really earns the respect due, “To support that effort, I am making contributions of $1 million each to two organizations, the International Association of Chiefs of Police’s newly established Institute for Community-Police Relations and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund,”   The NAACP? I could do without. They have done nothing to strengthen the black community, other than push for Marxist policies and laws. As for the other donation, well done sir. You are definitely a shining example of how these broken communities should proceed. 
The Hagerstown Police Department is under heavy fire after a video went viral of officers spraying pepper spray into the back of a police cruiser where a biracial teenage girl was handcuffed, according to Herald-Mail Media. The 15-year-old girl was struck by a car on Sunday while riding her bike, after which she hit her head and passed out for half a minute. Ambulances were called, but the girl said she didn’t want to go to a hospital. Police officers grabbed her off her bike as she tried to ride away and slammed her face into a nearby windowsill, eventually cuffing her hands. Panicked, the girl resisted officers as they attempted to push her into the back of the cruiser. She can be heard in the video repeatedly requesting for the presence of a black officer named “Zach.” “All we want to do is make sure she’s OK,” one officer tells a bystander, explaining that the girl might have lingering brain damage from the collision. Not even a minute later, an officer can be heard telling the girl to “put your feet in the car, OK, or you’re going to get sprayed.” When the frightened girl does not immediately comply, the officers close the door and then spray out their canisters into a crack in the window. The girl can then be heard shrieking in pain, saying “I can’t breathe” multiple times. Hagerstown Police Capt. Tom Langston only said on Wednesday that the department is still investigating. “We’re reviewing the body camera footage,” he said. Police have since charged the girl with failure to obey a traffic device, possession of marijuana, two counts of second-degree assault, and disorderly conduct. The girl is reportedly on the honor roll at school and before this incident has never had a criminal record. “The only treatment she got (from police) was slamming, abuse and Mace,” said the girl’s family attorney, Robin Ficker. According to Ficker, the pepper spray was not flushed out of her eyes for over three hours, and police requested that hospital staff refrain from taking pictures of her injuries during her stay. The full video of the pepper spraying incident can be found here: Posted by Robin Ficker Law Offices on Tuesday, September 20, 2016      
Soooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton. In Delaware, Ohio, Clinton was supposed to have a door-knocking event at 1 pm in the afternoon. One guy, who was documenting it for Donald Trump, showed up. He was it. No one came at all… when the staffers finally figured out who he was, they had him leave, but not before he got a gander at a whole lot of no one. I watched South Park last week and they joked that Clinton had maybe four supporters. It’s looking more and more like that is just about right. There are over 2 million people in that area and no one could be bothered to show up for the Hildabeast.  From Gateway Pundit: At Hillary Clinton’s Ohio campaign headquarters, volunteers were supposed to show up in droves to knock on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee. But, when this Donald Trump supporter showed up to the headquarters to check out the crowd, he found no one there. In fact, the only Hillary supporters at the offices were the staff running the headquarters. When the man said he was a Trump supporter and asked where all the volunteers were, they quickly showed him the door. The staffers for Hillary Clinton had expected door knockers to show up in droves. They must have been so disappointed. The Clinton campaign office was well stocked and neat. It was clearly ready to handle a large number of volunteers. The fact that no one showed indicates her ground game is in real trouble. If this is the case in all states out there, she will get clobbered by Donald Trump in the coming election. I wonder if you go to events like this in each state for Clinton what you would find. I have a feeling it will be eerily similar. This has got to have the Democrats in a panic. Hillary Clinton is supposed to be the favorite here… the one with the overwhelming advantage in the election. If that is true, where is everyone? Trump’s rallies are packed with thousands of people… he’s making her look ridiculous. There is more enthusiasm for an old shoe than for Clinton at this point. Clinton is spending millions (that she has stolen or gotten from our enemies) to staff these offices. When support is non-existent like this, you have to wonder what is the point. Between Trump leading in the polls, the enthusiasm factor, Hillary’s health, her corruption and terrorism concerns, it’s beginning to look more and more likely that the Trumpster will be the next president.   
WSOCTV is now reporting that there is dash cam footage of Keith Scott getting out of his car with a gun in his hand and approaching police officers. The police are not releasing the footage currently… they can’t. This is an internal affairs investigation and the footage will be used in court. Until the attorneys clear it, that video won’t be released. It sounds as though the guy had a thigh holster that had a gun in it that he pulled when he was approached. The excuse he didn’t know they were police officers won’t hold up either… they identified themselves as such when they commanded him to get out of his car. No book was found anywhere. The story his daughter is circulating to gin up racial animosity and riots is a lie.  From Gateway Pundit: Charlotte police reportedly have video of Keith Scott exiting his car, moving toward police officers, with a gun in his hand. And now race protesters are beating cops, tackling reporters, rioting and looting stores. Including the Hornets team store at the arena. […] The protest leaders are encouraging the community to fight back. After Keith Scott came after a cop with a gun and was shot dead. […] Keith Scott wasn’t holding a book. He was holding a gun and had a holster strapped to his leg. Currently, one protester is hanging on to life in critical condition after a second night of rioting. He was shot in the head by another protester. Cops and protesters have both been sent to hospitals and the violence is getting worse. The governor has now declared an emergency in Charlotte and the National Guard have been called in. A curfew is being considered as well. Scott charged those officers before he was shot and killed. Chief Kerr Putney told reporters on Wednesday that Officer Brentley Vinson saw Scott with a handgun and that Scott would not drop it after being ordered to do so. The officer that shot him followed procedure and did the right thing here. But it hardly matters… any excuse will do… any lie will do to start a race war and a riot. Charlotte exemplifies that. In the meantime, the riots continue and it is only a matter of time at this rate until someone is killed. Looting is rampant and the media have been attacked and brutalized. A photographer was shoved to the ground and then protesters tried to throw him into a fire. This is the chaos and violence Obama has been fomenting in our streets. It’s about to explode massively.  
Saying ‘you guys’ is one of many “microaggressions” these days. Using the incorrect pronoun to refer to someone else is also considered a microaggression, and in severe cases can carry with it criminal penalties. Now, mispronouncing a student’s name – even if it’s particularly difficult – is considered a microaggression. I’m talking about people from other countries who speak other languages and come from different cultures who have names that are difficult for us English-speaking people to pronounce. We’ve all had encounters with people from Central America, or India, or China, or somewhere in Eastern Europe, and have to have them repeat their name slowly so that we can – to the best of our abilities – pronounce it correctly. But unless you speak their native language fluently, you’re not going to get it. It doesn’t matter how close it sounds to you, inside, they’re laughing at the way you say their name. And I think most of these people understand that their names might be difficult for others – such as in America – to pronounce. But now, teachers mispronouncing their students’ names – even if they’re difficult – is a “microaggression.” And there’s a national movement to make sure teachers across the country aren’t guilty of this microaggression. CNS News reported: According to ‘My Name, My Identity: A Declaration of Self,’ a national campaign launched in 2015 by the Santa Clara County, Calif. Office of Education (SCCOE) and the National Association for Bilingual Education, a teacher who mispronounces a student’s name can cause that student “anxiety and resentment”. “Mispronouncing a student’s name truly negates his or her identity, which, in turn, can hinder academic progress,” according to Yee Wan, SCCOE’s director of multilingual education services. Rita Kohli, assistant professor of education at the University of California at Riverside, says it is a sign of “microagression” when a teacher mispronounces, disregards, or changes a child’s name, because “they are in a sense disregarding the family and culture of the student as well.” The Washoe County School District in Reno, Nevada is one of 528 school districts across the country that have recently implemented a campaign to “pronounce students’ names correctly” – including names teachers and administrators find difficult or unfamiliar – in order to be sensitive to the ancestral and historical significance of a child’s name. CNS News linked to a 2014 blog post by a former teacher Jennifer Gonzalez who argued that “mutilating someone’s name is a tiny act of bigotry.” She continued:  “Whether you intend to or not, what you’re communicating is this: Your name is different. Foreign. Weird. It’s not worth my time to get it right…. “And before you get all defensive about the bigotry thing, let’s be clear: Discovering that something you do might be construed as bigotry doesn’t mean anyone is calling you a bigot. It’s just an opportunity to grow.” What wasn’t brought up, of course, is how people from outside the U.S. pronounce Americans’ names. My name is easy for me to pronounce, but non-Americans often have a hard time pronouncing it. And guess how much it hurts my feelings when they “mispronounce” it? Not a bit.

Massive protests have broken out in Charlotte, North Carolina, after police shot and killed disabled African-American man named Keith Lamont Scott, who was apparently reading a book in his car, waiting for his son to come home from school when officers shot him dead. Details are still sketchy at the moment, but it appears the police were in search of of another armed man in the area. Scott is the sixth civilian shot by Charlotte police this year. Twelve officers have apparently been injured as tear gas canisters were fired into the crowd. Coming so soon after the shooting of Terrence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma, it is clear that all the protests and anger at the disregard for the lives of black Americans shown by our police forces have accomplished nothing. Scott is the 215th black man shot by police this year. This is an ongoing story that will be updated as new developments occur.

Turns out the online polls being re-tweeted all over Twitter by Trump supporters and the presidential candidate himself are not organic, but part of an elaborate campaign created to manipulate the polling and fool the public into thinking that the debate was a Trump victory after-the-fact. Here’s Trump’s tweet with all his fictitious accolades: Such a great honor. Final debate polls are in – and the MOVEMENT wins!#AmericaFirst #MAGA #ImWithYouhttps://t.co/3KWOl2ibaW pic.twitter.com/sfCEE3I5pF — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016 Tuesday morning after the first televised presidential debate, a mysterious #TrumpWon hashtag emerged from the Russian troll-farms in St. Petersberg that started trending along with dubious online polls saying Trump had won the debate. The hashtag ran contrary to the popular opinion reflected in every major media news network poll, which showed Hilary Clinton as the clear winner of the night. Even conservative TV network Fox News conceded this point when attracting attention to the polls saying, “if polls only included media pundits, Hillary Clinton would have won Monday’s debate by a landslide.” Thing is, Hilary did win the debate by a landslide, even if the online polls didn’t accurately reflect that. And thanks to The Daily Dot, we now know the reason why Trump won the online polls but literally lost by every other yardstick: It’s because Trump supporters cheated. The effort to create a false narrative of a Trump debate victory began by recruiting members of the pro-Trump Reddit community r/The_Donald and 4chan message boards, affecting somewhere around 70 polls, including polls by Time, Fortune, and CNBC. The r/The_Donald community has over 200,000 subscribers, and with its numbers it made short work of online polls susceptible to bots, vote brigading, and other forms of manipulation that make these online survey results extremely dubious.  This latest instance of foul play from the Trump campaign tells us the length to which Trump supporters will go to get their candidate elected, especially if they see it as their only recourse. Luckily nothing could be done for Donald, because his loss was so dramatically obvious, that tampering with the polls wasn’t enough to hide the glaring fact that he lost. Let’s hope that next November, manipulating online polls won’t be enough to stop the critical mass of reasonable voters who don’t want to elect a megalomaniac.
President Obama just made his last address as a sitting President to the United Nations General Assembly. In his speech he stressed about the necessity of international law and order. He told the assembly of 140 different countries that the United States would have to give up some of our freedoms. Yup, you read that right. He passive aggressively made attacks against those who oppose a lenient form of refugee resettlement. As well, he noted that one of the worlds greatest problems being dealt with is when, “powerful nations contest the constraints placed on them by international law. We can press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration, or we can retreat… along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion.” Several times he references global integration as well as noting that liberal societies show discrimination and intolerance when women choose to cover themselves. An obvious reference to the Burkini ban in France. Obama said, “And in Europe and the United States, you see people wrestle with concerns about immigration and changing demographics, and suggesting that somehow people who look different are corrupting the character of our countries.” The absolute worse part was then he said that America would likely have to accept more constraints, and deprive themselves of freedoms by binding ourselves to international rules. Specifically, he said, “We have to put our money where our mouths are. And we can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations like my own accept constraints. Sometimes I’m criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions, but I’m convinced in the long run giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests but binding ourselves to international rules, over the long-term, enhances our security.” Watch his speech here,  This progressive politicians tune has not changed one bit. When in fact all the things he is criticizing about anti refugee sentiment are things that Americans and other Europeans actually believe and feel. Yet, he dismisses it. He and his administration are the only ones who feel this way. This way being a liberal narrative. The narrative being that Islam is a peaceful religion, jihadism does not represent Islam, more refugees should be allowed into the United States with less vetting, and that incoming refugees don’t deteriorate a countries culture. These are all true yet he dismisses it like it is completely false. Just because he and his administration don’t admit the truth to themselves does not mean the rest of us have to remain in the dark. He is an embarrassment of this country and is destroying the hegemonic presence the United States has in the global arena. He’s too passive. Everyone knows they can take advantage and walk all over us. 
A pregnant southern California woman was allegedly brutally attacked by someone who responded to a fake "rape fantasy" ad on Craigslist created by her husband's ex-girlfriend.  Ontario-based Michelle Suzanne Hadley, 29, was apprehended and jailed July 18 on a $1 million bond.  Hadley dated a U.S. Marshals Service agent between 2013 and 2015. Prosecutors say Hadley placed ads posing as her ex-boyfriend’s new wife to lure men into sexually attacking the woman, who was pregnant with the couple’s first child, reports KCBS. Hadley gave the couple’s Anaheim address to men who responded to the ad on Craigslist, asking them to drop by when she knew the victim would be home alone. Numerous men showed up, one of whom assaulted the pregnant woman. Fortunately, she managed to call for assistance.  The suspect was previously accused of threatening the same woman and her unborn baby. Although the pregnant woman filed a restraining order against Hadley on June 6, Hadley violated the order by stalking the victim and was arrested June 24, according to the Daily Mail.  Hadley was released on $100,000 bail, but prosecutors say she continued sending threatening emails and responding to the "rape fantasy" ads on Craigslist. “Hadley is accused of telling the responders that the victim wanted the responders to have forcible sexual intercourse with her, even if she screamed or resisted,” the Orange County DA said in a statement. “Several of the responders showed up at Jane Doe's residence with the intention of raping the victim but did not succeed.  “One responder arrived at Jane Doe's residence and physically attacked the victim before she was able to call for help and the man fled the scene.” The jilted lover is charged with stalking, stalking despite a restraining order, assault with the intent to commit a sexual offense during a first-degree burglary, and making criminal threats, plus six counts of attempted forcible rape. Hadley’s arraignment is scheduled for August 19. If convicted, she could face seven years to life in prison.
A cop from Dallas, Texas has filed a lawsuit against a number of individuals he feels is directly responsible for inciting a number of attacks on law enforcement across the nation. He’s sick of the cops being gunned down and murdered. Targeted outright. Much like what BLM claims is happening to them, yet lacking in the proof. Speaking of Black Lives Matter, they are one of the groups being sued…and for all the right reasons.  Sgt. Demetrick Pennie, who is a 17-year veteran of the Dallas Police Department, filed a civil complaint in federal court on Friday, Sept. 16th against the Black Lives Matter movement as well as a bunch of other political figures that have taken advantage of the turmoil and escalated it. Two of these political figures include Obama and Hillary Clinton. Now that’s some high ground he’s aiming for. Rev. Al Sharpton, Louis Farrakhan and evil crony capitalist George Soros are also named as defendants in the filing. According to this Texas cop, these individuals and groups have participated in “threats and attacks” against police officers nationwide, including the murders of five Dallas officers at a Black Lives Matter protest on Jul. 7th. “…repeatedly incited their supporters and others to engage in threats of and attacks to cause serious bodily injury or death upon police officers and other law enforcement persons of all races and ethnicities.” Attorney Larry Klayman of Freedom Watch is representing Sgt. Pennie.   Will anything happen from this? I have a very hard time believing so. This feat might be too big for one person to file against. It might be a show type lawsuit and if it is, God bless the man for taking a stand against tyranny from both the government and the mobs…but I won’t hold my breath. …well, maybe just a little…a man can dream, can’t he? 
A poll of voters nationwide and focus groups in swing states show voters believe Hillary Clinton was the clear winner in Monday night’s debate. In a CNN/ORC poll of voters watching the debate live on CNN, the former Secretary of State was named the winner by an almost three to one margin. 62 percent of CNN viewers thought the Democratic nominee won the debate, while just 27 percent of viewers thought Trump prevailed in the 90-minute, commercial-free slugfest. Who won? Per CNN's poll of debate watchers: Clinton: 62% Trump: 27% pic.twitter.com/y7RCwXxrhN — Dan Diamond (@ddiamond) September 27, 2016  Public Policy Polling (PPP) also conducted its own nationwide poll of voters, and found that Hillary Clinton was again the favorite by a 51-40 margin among a survey of 1,002 debate watchers who had been pre-selected to give their thoughts immediately after the debate. Among the poll’s key findings were that 63 percent of young voters thought Clinton won, while just 24 percent named Trump as the victor. Clinton won by 54-36 among women voters, and by a whopping 77-13 margin among voters who identified as either African American or Latino. However, Trump was named the winner among white voters by a slim 47-45 margin. PPP also asked respondents if either candidate could be trusted with nuclear weapons. Those surveyed said Clinton could be trusted with the nation’s nuclear arsenal by a 56-35 margin, while voters said Donald Trump could not be trusted with nuclear weapons by a 42-51 margin. Perhaps most importantly, focus groups of voters in two key swing states overwhelmingly thought Hillary Clinton won the Hofstra debate over Trump. A CNN focus group of 20 undecided Florida voters found that 18 of the 20 voters in the sample thought Clinton won the debate. Another focus group of 22 voters in Pennsylvania, surveyed by conservative strategist Frank Luntz, found that 16 thought Clinton won the debate, while just 6 thought Trump won. 18 of 20 voters in CNN focus group in Florida say Clinton won debate tonight, @PamelaBrownCNN reports — Manu Raju (@mkraju) September 27, 2016  Who won tonite's debate?

Terrorism seems to be producing more stupidity than fear, I keep hearing the word suspect or suspected every time a bomb goes off in America or when the words Allahu Akbar is screamed out when a mass shooting takes place. I get to listen to a New York Mayor tell the nation that the bomb blast had no relation to the bomb blast in New Jersey on the same day. I guess the FBI could learn a lot from this Mayor. A reporter on Fox News says the bomb  could have been a pressure cooker that someone put in the garbage can by mistake. The media will put on experts and have many opinions to tell all about something that needs no explanation except just one. These Muslims are going to kill us unless we kill them first. When law enforcement catches or kills one I could care less about his personal history that the media always uses to make a good story to tell. The only thing I care about is punishing him without the pleasure of giving him a life sentence in a prison where he gets to choose his food from a Muslim menu, free medical service, recreation facilities,  a TV to watch his friends terrorist activities all over the world and a Quran with a prayer rug. Terrorists should be tried by law within thirty days after their capture and sentenced  in the same time frame. I am just a simple man and I would rather form my own opinion than letting the media doing it for me. After all, who wants to be stupid? 
A mother is outraged after council chiefs removed her deceased son’s star-shaped headstone following a complaint from another family who claimed it wasn’t “in keeping” with the rest of the cemetery. Max Corbett-Gardener was just 4 years old when he passed away after complications from his severe epilepsy. His mother, Jo Corbett-Weeks, 42, saved up $4,580 to design a specially-made headstone featuring a teddy bear holding a star inscribed with a tribute to her son, the Daily Mail reports.  The heartfelt memorial was erected on Max’s grave to commemorate what would have been the boy’s seventh birthday. But three days later, the headstone was removed from Great Malvern Cemetery by council chiefs in Worcestershire. “It would have been Max's seventh birthday on the Sunday, and this was like a birthday present to him from me,” Corbett-Weeks, who has two other children ages 16 and 5, told BBC. “I chose a star-shaped stone because I wanted something suitable for Max - something personal. “This stone is just so perfect for my poor little chap," she added.  A family had complained to the Malvern Town Council that the headstone was not “in keeping” with the rest of the cemetery. Corbett-Weeks says the stone was then removed without her knowledge or consent and she is demanding that it be reinstated. “I was totally unaware this was going on. The council did not contact me and it was the stonemason who told me he'd been ordered to remove it,” Corbett-Weeks explained. “I feel upset, distressed and angry. We have been through so much as a family. I could understand if the grave was uncared for or unsightly, but it isn't. “The headstone meant a lot to me and the family but now we are fighting to have it put back," she said. "It's a horrible situation. We just want to have somewhere to grieve.” The memorial was placed in the adult area of the cemetery, where Corbett-Weeks had her son buried so that he could be close to other family members.  The council said that if the application for the stone had been received within the usual time frame, they would not have given the stonemason permission to install it in the first place. They added that had the star-shaped headstone been installed at the children’s area of the cemetery, it would have been allowed. “We have a conformity of shapes in our lawn cemetery. We were contacted by people who objected to the shape,” a Malvern Town Council spokesman explained to BBC. “The longer it stayed up, the harder the process would have been. “It was a very difficult decision to remove it but one we had to make straight away," the spokesman said. The council added that the complaint was not so much about the shape of the headstone as it was about following protocol. 'It wasn't necessarily an objection to the shape but why we appeared to be applying one rule to one family and other rules to another,” the spokesman continued. “The stonemason in this situation did not have permission to put the stone up - and the stone is not in keeping with the graves in that area. “By not following the correct process he has caused considerable distress to both families," the spokesman concluded. The council is arranging a meeting with Corbett-Weeks to discuss a new design for her son’s headstone. Sources: Daily Mail, BBC Photo Credit: BBC, worcestershirenews.co.uk
You know America has gone wrong when we’re letting transgender men with a penis waltz into the women’s bathroom, black protesters turn things into a riot, and now you can’t even express anger, at your own business, with a violent, child marrying, religion like Islam without people getting mad at you. WHAT THE F*CK HAPPENED TO AMERICA? Back when I was younger no one cared about your feelings. People got things DONE. People WORKED hard. People bashed and roasted each other in good humor and we had strong families, good work ethics, and we loved throwing back a cold beer during football games and cracking stereotype jokes because those are literally the best kinds of jokes to laugh at. But not now. Rich millionaire athletes can’t celebrate a touchdown. Women have to pee next to a man who can’t figure out his f*cking gender from a hole in the wall. People are labeled as racist if they make any comment whatsoever about race, even when the stereotypical jokes are funny BECAUSE THEY ARE TRUE. And now, in America, you can’t even put up your own sign on your own business without the snowflake idiots of America crying about how offensive it is. Well screw those people. We found another hero among wimps and his name is Dan Ruedinger. He’s awesome because he’s not afraid to express his distaste for a creepy religion. He doesn’t want Muslims in his family restaurant. You know why, because the religion of Islam sucks. There’s too many terrorists, woman beaters, and child marrying sickos in that religion and it’s time to put a foot down. Dan put up a sign on his restaurant that seriously infuriated Muslims all across the planet. I bet there was at least 20 goats humiliated from the backside on the day Dan’s sign saying “MUSLIMS GET OUT” was first seen by an Islamic person. Oh well. Go bang your goats and marry the first graders while thinking about the 72 male virgins waiting to take your rear virginity when you detonate a clock bomb somewhere.  Wonder what it said? Let’s zoom in a little bit!    Madworld Media – Dan Ruedinger, owner of Treats Family Restaurant, was sickened when he heard about the recent Islamic terrorist attacks in Minnesota, New York, and New Jersey. Instead of ignoring what had happened like so many people are, Dan decided to take a bold stand by placing a sign in front of his restaurant with three bold words – “Muslims Get Out.” If I saw a family of people with their faces covered walking into a restaurant, then I’d ask them to remove the garments. I don’t know if they’re going to bomb something or order pancakes and if I made it out alive, then I’d want to identify them if I could. And since I think Dan’s sign is funny, and his right to express his distaste for a religion that’s responsible for so many sick things, then I bet that makes me a stereotypical racist Islamaphobe. Cool. Next time you hear about a terrorist attack, remember, Dan’s sign was right. And is THIS the kind of people you want in your restaurant?  
A new crime show has revealed a shocking twist in the case of JonBenet Ramsey's murder. On Sept. 19, "The Case Of: JonBenet Ramsey" aired on CBS, revealing a surprising suspect in the murder -- her brother, Burke Ramsey. In 1996, JonBenet, a child beauty queen, was found beaten and strangled to death in her family's cellar, just hours after her mother, Patsy, called 911 to report that she had been kidnapped. To this day, no charges have been filed in the case and there has been much speculation about who may be responsible. In the new two-part CBS documentary, a team of experts reviews the evidence in the case and, in the final minutes of the special, reveal that they have reason to believe Burke, who was 9 at the time, may be the suspect. The experts believe, however, that JonBenet's death could have been accidental.  It was revealed in the documentary that Burke struck his younger sister with a golf club a year before her death after "losing his temper," according to the Daily Mail. James Kolar, former chief of investigation for the District Attorney in Boulder, presented the theory that Burke may be responsible for JonBenet's death. He noted that Patsy had left a bowl of pineapple and some tea for Burke and that when Burke caught JonBenet trying to sneak some of the fruit later on, he lashed out and struck her with a flashlight, killing her. "My hypothesis was that I think the Ramseys came home around 9:30, 10 o'clock," Kolar said. "I think JonBenet was asleep. I think John did carry her upstairs, Patsy remained downstairs with Burke and served him the tea and the pineapple. I think that accounts for the physical evidence as well as the latent print. Then she got JonBenet up to make sure she used the toilet, so she didn't wet the bed that night." Kolar added, "JonBenet was up, she may or may not have brushed her teeth, that stuff was out on the counter, then I think she was up and awake enough that she was maybe still hungry and she went downstairs." "In the meantime, Patsy continued packing for the Michigan trip," he continued. "I think if Burke was upset about circumstances or Christmas presents, he probably would have been upset about her trying to snag a piece of pineapple -- out of anger he may have struck her with that flashlight." Investigators believe that there was likely no intent to kill on Burke's part, but that the Ramsey family had intended to mislead the investigation. "The Ramsey family did not want law enforcement to resolve this case and that's why it remains unresolved," former FBI profiler Jim Clemente said. Investigators added that they do not believe Burke was involved in the cover-up, but that both parents likely were, based on the conflicting motives in the ransom letter. It was also concluded that DNA on JonBenet's underwear did not match any family member and did not prove that any sexual assault had taken place, notes Us Weekly.

A local prosecutor in Tulsa, Oklahoma has brought charges against Betty Shelby, the officer who shot and killed Terence Crutcher. In a press conference Thursday afternoon, the Tulsa County District Attorney’s office announced a warrant for Officer Betty Shelby’s arrest on the charge of felony manslaughter in the first degree. Shelby fired the shot that killed 40-year-old Terence Crutcher, who was unarmed and had his hands raised throughout his fatal encounter with police last weekend. BREAKING: #Tulsa DA files 1st degree manslaughter charges #BettyShelby for #TerenceCruther shooting. pic.twitter.com/h4PC6EBWwm — Tiffany Alaniz (@TiffanyAlaniz) September 22, 2016  “I don’t know why things happen in this world the way they do,” said District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler. “We need to pray for wisdom and guidance on each of our respective paths in life. Each of us at the end of our days will have to account for our own actions. The only way I know to walk my path is to try every day to pray and to serve my fellow citizens so that he or she may be lifted up.” Tulsa’s top law enforcement officer appealed to the community to allow the judicial system to do its work. Tulsa police chief Chuck Jordan has contacted the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), asking them to conduct their own separate civil rights investigation into the shooting. “I want to assure our community and assure all of you, and people across the nation looking at this, we will achieve justice,” Jordan said. Shelby is arguing that she had a right to shoot Crutcher because he allegedly failed to obey her commands. Her attorney, Scott Wood, said Shelby was a drug recognition expert and believed Crutcher was under the influence of drugs when she encountered him. “By the end of the incident, Officer Shelby was screaming at him to stop. He did not obey one single command given to him,” Wood told local media. Newson6.com reported that Officer Shelby had two prior excessive force complaints lodged against her during the course of her career, though both were unfounded. U.S. Attorney Danny Williams said the DOJ will thoroughly investigate whether or not Crutcher’s civil rights were infringed upon. “Will devote whatever resources necessary to ensure all allegations of serious civil rights violations are fully and completely investigated,” Williams said. Crutcher, a father of four, was on his way home from a community college class when his SUV broke down. When officers responded, Crutcher, who had his hands up, was shot when he walked toward his driver side window. Officers did not find a weapon on Crutcher’s person or in his vehicle.        
On Friday morning, Donald Trump released additional names to add to his list of potential Supreme Court nominees should he win the general election for the presidency in November. One of the names on the list is Utah Senator Mike Lee, a constitutional expert who clerked under Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito. Upon learning that Trump listed him as a potential nominee, Lee immediately put any speculation as to whether he would accept such a nomination to rest. Conn Carroll, spokesman for Mike Lee’s office said, “Sen. Lee already has the job he wants which is why he is campaigning to represent the great people of Utah again this year.” Here are the new additions to Trump’s SCOTUS list.

The Republican witch hunt to make the IRS commissioner pay for…something… backfired in spectacular fashion after Democrats, insulted at having been dragged into this show trial, took the opportunity to instead flip the script. During IRS Commissioner John Koskinen’s hearing, Democrats began ignoring the “impeachment” nonsense and focused entirely on getting to the bottom of Donald Trump’s numerous tax scandals, including specific questions about his tax returns and charity fraud. Of particular interest was Trump’s stated excuse for not releasing his tax returns because he is under audit. Tax experts have long noted that this argument is complete nonsense. An audit does not preclude the ability to show the American people your finances before an election. The head of the IRS – who presumably knows a thing or two about this – agreed. “Is there anything that would prohibit someone from releasing tax returns, if they want to, because they’re under audit?” Rep. Jerry Nadler, a Democrat from New York asked. “No,” Koskinen responded simply. Another Democratic representative asked it another way. “Would releasing the person’s tax return during the audit in any way impact that pending audit of the return?” Rep. Ted Deutch asked. “The release itself wouldn’t. The concern sometimes by taxpayers is that when the information is public there may be more information that will be discovered or provided,” Koskinen said. In other words, Trump was worried that releasing his tax returns could make him look bad, or possibly allow nosy reporters to find even more criminality that the IRS missed the first time. This answer actually confirms what Trump’s son suggested to reporters in an unusual break from his dad. It wasn’t the audit that scares Trump, it’s that reporters seeing the tax returns would allow them to discover what’s in them and that would destroy his father’s chances of becoming president. It may be for this reason that Trump has hinted he will only release his tax returns after the election. It won’t matter then. The beatings continued in earnest while Republicans were forced to sit there with “What have we done?” expressions painted on their faces. Democrats then went on to highlight some of the items that could prove problematic for Trump to disclose, such as his actual income, what he pays the government in taxes, clues to his actual net worth and records of his charitable giving. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) wondered aloud if discovering payments by Russia might suggest a monetary ― or even treasonous ― motive for going soft on a U.S. rival. Several also raised the recent reports of Trump using his tax-free foundation to to buy paintings and sports memorabilia, to fund political campaigns and to pay business expenses. “Is it appropriate for a foundation to give political donations?” asked Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas). The answer was no. Rep. Luis Gutierrez smiled in the face of Republican discomfort at the questions while munching on a bag of Skittles (a not-so-subtle nod to Trump Jr.’s recent comparison of Syrian refugees to poisoned candy). He later clarified that, unlike some people, he wouldn’t stop eating Skittles if he got a bad one. It was not a good day to be a Republican lawmaker. The IRS commissioner is facing a Republican-orchestrated impeachment due to what they say was a cover up to hide IRS targeting of conservative groups. The minor detail that no evidence of the IRS head actually targeting conservative groups actually exists didn’t seem to bother them. The impeachment hearing, widely agreed to be a dog-and-pony show, came after Republican leaders managed to stop an embarrassing impeachment vote on the House floor which would have humiliated the GOP with yet another stark example for the American voters of how frivolous and dysfunctional the party has become. They settled for grandstanding. So with the knowledge that Republicans were wasting everyone’s time, Democrats decided to use those wasted hours to highlight just how corrupt Donald Trump is. Waste not, want not. Watch the IRS hearing, starting with Rep. Nadler’s investigation into Trump’s lies, here:  Featured image via YouTube  Billionaire Nick Hanauer says things need to change, but not the way we expect.
It seems as if our suspicions were correct from the onset. Hillary Clinton and her ‘physician’ are not telling the American people the truth about her health. This is the woman who claims transparency and as has never lied. In a recent report from the liberal leaning New York Times, Dr. Lawrence K. Altman M.D. brings it all out into the open. The doctor also makes sure to point out that what was released by Trump was not extensive enough too. Read the story below.  As Written By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D. for the New York Times: The disclosure last week that Hillary Clinton was beingtreated for pneumonia thrust the health of both of the major parties’ presidential candidates and their running mates to the center of the campaign, and led to the release of more detailed medical histories from the two candidates seeking what is widely regarded as the world’s most demanding job. Mrs. Clinton, 68, the Democratic presidential nominee, who has had serious medical problems in recent years, released on Wednesday an update of a July 2015 letter from her doctor attesting to her overall good health and ability to serve a full four-year term as president. However, the doctor, Dr. Lisa Bardack of Mt. Kisco, N.Y., noted that Mrs. Clinton had developed two new medical conditions in 2016: a sinus and ear infection in the winter and pneumonia this month. Dr. Bardack wrote that she had regularly examined Mrs. Clinton this year for routine care and that she had been closely monitoring her pneumonia, which is improving. But doctors not connected with the candidate’s care say that the letters omit basic information like height and weight, and that a more detailed history of her blood clots and a 2012 concussion should be disclosed. Still, the information Mrs. Clinton has made public is more extensive than the details … Full Story Here: How Healthy Is Hillary Clinton? Doctors Weigh In – The New York Times
This very week, when Americans were shaken by yet several more violent attacks across the nation by Radical Muslim terrorists, we as a nation were shocked and numbed in disbelief by plans still firmly in place by the Obama administration to bring in 110,000 Muslim refugees from the Middle East this year. Hillary Clinton, on the stump campaigning for President, vows to increase those numbers of poorly vetted Muslim immigrants to more than 620,000 her first year in office if elected. The stark raving madness of such plans is unfathomable. It is a widely known fact that there is no means of screening this huge wave of Muslim immigrants to determine which among them are radical extremists and thus potential terrorists. Nor do we have any database to screen them for potential criminals or with criminal pasts. Additionally we have no means to screen them to learn whether or not they are willing to assimilate into the mainstream culture and values of American life. Yet inexplicably, both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are deadly serious in their hardened determination to bring these 600,000-plus Muslim immigrants to America at the very time that deadly acts of terrorism are on the increase by radical Muslims on American soil. The number one job of the US President is to keep our citizens safe and secure. Yet to both American citizens in the various states and local communities, as well as among state and local elected officials it is increasingly obvious that security and safety is rapidly vanishing and that we are in “clear and present danger”. The governors of at least two dozen states have forcefully opposed the immigration and resettlement of Muslims, not only because of the “no questions asked” open door policy, but also due to proven incidents of crime and violence by Muslim immigrants who were resettled by Obama in Twin Falls, Idaho, Minneapolis, Minnesota, New England and elsewhere. This week Texas governor Greg Abbott flatly declared his firm refusal to resettle any additional Mideast Muslim immigrants in Texas, citing the potential dangers to American citizens and Texas residents for outright defiant refusal. While more than two dozen states, led again by Texas have sued the Obama administration for various and egregious abuses of power and unconstitutional executive overreaches meddling in state and local matters, the action this week by Texas governor Abbott consisted of an outright, defiant refusal. As a writer with a strong knowledge of American history, the Constitution and the workings of government, Governor Abbott’s action on behalf of Texas this week strongly suggests the invoking of the Tenth Amendment protecting states’ rights, and thus the principle of nullification of unconstitutional federal acts against states. The nullification principles have been debated in terms of scope and circumstantial legality at various times since before the Civil War. For decades after Union Victory nullification of unlawful federal action, as well as secession from the union, appeared to be settled as illegal. However, the Southern States resurrected the issues of nullification and secession during the battle over civil rights and racial integration in the 1950s and 60s. Given the “moral high ground” advantage owned by the Feds at the time the notion of nullification gained little political steam. The past eight years of the Obama administration, which has wrought untold misery to Americans though both disastrous policies and increasingly lawless and unconstitutional executive actions, has revived the Tenth Amendment, states’ rights issue and the principle of nullification of unlawful federal actions by one or more states has been resurrected with a vengeance. With radical Islamic terrorism spreading like wildfire around the world, including Europe and now in America, local officials and governors in over half the states are frantically working to find legitimate means to protect citizens and preserve the rule of law. Even the two centuries old “checks and balances” in three separate branches of government no longer apply; for two years the GOP majority in Congress utterly refused to check and limit the dangerous, lawless overreach of Obama’s executive branch, and numerous federal courts, including the Supreme Court have also failed to limit executive branch lawlessness. The astounding rise of Donald Trump, the Tea Party, the open revolt against “Washington Political Establishment, along with the widely understood tyrannical executive actions by Obama that go unchallenged, State governors are banding together to fight federal tyranny. On the “frontier strip” an organization called “Free Nebraska” has led the way in partnership with similar movements in other states, to call for the convening of a”convention of states”. It appears very likely when analyzing these related events in clear resistance to dangerously growing federal power and control over issues that are in the prerogative of individual states, that the highly unusual and noteworthy action of the governor of Texas to directly confront the federal government and Mr. Obama, that state-by-state nullification actions and declaring state government sovereignty under the “reserve clause” (powers reserved to the states)of the Tenth Amendment is a growing conflict. Knowing the tyrannical nature of the Federal Government, the growing power struggle escalating into a states’ rights nullification battle involving potentially a score or more of state governors is certain to quickly turn ugly and potentially violent. Given the precarious political situation and this Presidential election the most consequential in American history, a nullification battle involving states’ rights to limit and push back against federal tyranny, the nullification battle begun by Texas appears very likely to further divide America as some state governments rebel and other states acquiesce. Let us pray to our Lord that freedom will be restored peacefully. However an already deeply divided America is being further divided and clearly leading to open rebellion, we must also pray for avoidance of civil insurrection. The stark reality however, is that federal tyranny is clearly headed toward dictatorship, and the bitter but forced choice between liberty and tyranny will result in a ferocious struggle to restore American liberty and the outcome, while uncertain, is just as clearly leading to a historical confrontation and bitter conflict. May God bless America as we endeavor to confront and defeat the tyranny in Washington, D.C. Freedom comes with a price; to restore freedom to America that price will be high. Let us pray to Almighty God that He will empower us to overcome the monstrous evil we now face, and fight. 
Arizona's laws on child molestation are so broad that a parent changing a diaper could be prosecuted for criminal activity. That is the opinion of defense attorney Russ Richelsoph and a minority of judges on the Arizona Supreme Court, according to The Arizona Republic. Child molestation in Arizona is defined as intentionally or knowingly engaging in sexual contact with a child under the age of 15. Sexual contact is interpreted as “direct or indirect touching, fondling or manipulating” of a child’s genitals or private parts. Unlike other states, the Arizona law does not require there to be an intent to harm, violate or arouse by the alleged perpetrator. In a recent ruling, the Arizona Supreme court confirmed that proving intent was not necessary. As a result, it ruled that a parent changing a diaper or a physician conducting an examination could be charged with molestation under the current interpretation of the law. “When you have a statute that criminalizes such a broad set of behaviors that everybody’s a criminal, everybody who has changed a diaper, every physician or nurse who has examined the genitals of a child, that’s a huge problem,” defense attorney Russ Richelsoph told The Republic. Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery disagreed and believes some common sense has to be observed. “I’m a parent. I have prosecutors who are parents,” Montgomery said. “We know the difference between diapering and molesting a child.” Montgomery said prosecutors handle such cases carefully. “If a defendant is going to bring that up in trial and we don’t have any evidence to show that there was sexual motivation, then juries are not going to convict, grand jurors are not going to indict,” he told KPNX. The court ruling said that changing the law was the responsibility of politicians. “We agree that the criminal code should clearly differentiate between unlawful conduct and innocent, acceptable behavior without unnecessarily broadly sweeping the latter into the former,” the court opinion stated, The Republic reported. Two judges authored a dissenting opinion. “Parents and other caregivers who have changed an infant’s soiled diaper or bathed a toddler will be surprised to learn that they have committed a class 2 or 3 felony,” the dissenting judges argued. Richelsoph described scenarios in which the legislation could be abused. “Physicians get accused of molesting children. Parents, especially in divorce situations, get accused of molesting children,” Richelsoph added. “And then you have someone spending a lot of money on a private defense attorney or having to get a public defender.” Sources: The Arizona Republic, KPNX / Photo credit: The Arizona Republic
The protests that shook the city of Charlotte last night and injured sixteen police officers have continued into a second night. One person has been shot dead; it is still unclear whether or not the police or a civilian was the shooter. The public displays of frustration over the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott have mostly been peaceful but certain agitators have been escalating the situation with rocks and looting. The police, in their imposing riot gear and hurling tear gas into the crowds, are not de-escalating matters. The protesters are demanding that the police release the video of the killing of Keith Lamont Scott; the state is responding the only way it knows how – with violence. We hope that protesters will remain peaceful and understand their frustration with the reckless enthusiasm with which American police officers seem to be killing African-American citizens. UPDATE: It appears the National Guard is on the way. Reporter @JoeBrunoWSOC9 says "help is coming from Washington" per #Charlotte mayor.#CharlotteProtest #CharlotteUprising #KeithScott — Andrew Westmoreland (@drewwest_press) September 22, 2016  Here is a livestream of the incident, courtesy of RT.

Mohamed Hamada’s book The Trump Revolution is available for FREE here until the election.  Read Introduction and Chapter I here.  The Dishonorable Businessmen! The Elite! Before I start whipping the corrupt, dishonorable businessmen, I want to note two points: The first point, this book is written from the point of view of a Capitalist who believes in honorable businessmen who, in turn, are responsible for building the country, and employing its people. With the “country,” I mean America not China or Mexico. The second point, I can hear someone saying Trump is a businessman and he is from the elite. Let me say something, when you play a sport and you want to be successful you follow the rules that are set for the game even if you don’t like them. However, if you head the federation of that sport you would have a chance to change the rules that you do not believe in. Now we are ready for the whipping. The elite of this country, a group of very rich businessmen. They own almost everything including the media and the politicians. You can even call them the neo-lords. Let’s tell an old story that we all know to see where the neo-lords emerged from. America is the land of the free. The peasants fled Europe from the oppression of their lords, the hunger, the illness, etc. They fled to America to live as free farmers, until the neo-lords grew again in the land of the free. At the old time the lord was the owner and the ruler. Now, the neo-lords, who are the elite businessmen, are the owners and they own the rulers, the politicians shall we say. They even went further, and decided to own the minds and hearts of the people, so they decided to own the media and they even penetrated the churches. The lord-peasant system found its way again to the land of the free. The system developed. After a struggle, the American People adapted to the new system and forced their elite businessmen to adapt to the idea that they are dealing with free people. The elite businessmen uncomfortable with the idea that the American People are not peasants enough, they decided to leave to where they can find real peasants. They got their bought-off politicians to sign a couple of regional and international free trade agreements. The factories moved to China, Mexico and other countries as a consequence. Apparently, the elite-businessmen found that their multi-billion dollars are not big enough fortune, so they moved to China to make an extra couple of billions of dollars on cheap labor. Probably, they were afraid that their children might starve and they need an extra couple of billions to make sure they are full. In the transition, they are using America as a market, a dwindling market. It shrinks as more and more factories are closing and moving abroad. Consequently, more and more workers are laid off. And so, less shoppers and buyers. An economy cannot be sustained by the people selling services to each other and producing nothing. The elite-businessmen are milking the cows to the last drop and slaughtering them one after one. Quite like the lords in the earlier history, when they are fed-up with a town and the people are harder to rule; they pillage it, burn it and move to another town to start again. That is what the corrupt elite of the United States’ businessmen are doing. They use their politicians and their media to get the job done. The corruption prevailed, but the free Americans figured out that there is something wrong and they started to revolt. They did not know where to start and what to do, so Donald Trump jumped in and decided to lead them. Stand Up America, The Leader Is Here. So how should an honorable businessman be? The businessman is a career. Like any career, it has its duties and its ethics. So what are the duties? The businessman’s job is building the elements of the economy of the country using his special abilities; like his skills, knowledge, personal character etc. He has to take part in building the country. He has to be involved in forming and executing plans to develop the country. Before and after these, he is responsible for employing the people of his country and getting the best out of them. To accomplish that, he has to socially secure the lives of the workers to make them feel that the time and effort are worth giving. For the businessman to achieve this goal, he has to watch for the health of his workers, physical, mental and psychological. What I mentioned are not newly innovated ideas. Many companies are famous for their “good benefits and pay.” That’s what a businessman is supposed to do. What are our elite-businessmen doing? They are shutting factories’ doors, they lay off workers and they move the factories to other countries. Then, they force the people of the United States to buy the products of the factories they moved to the other countries!!! I hate to be sarcastic, but “what a patriotic and responsible action.” I can hear them murmuring: “hmm……. The workers have to help themselves, to stand for themselves hmm…..” Congratulations for increasing your profits greedy Blood Suckers. Imagine that all the American medical doctors decided to close the hospitals and to move them to another countries. So, to make more money, they leave the American patients to stand for themselves. Imagine if a man decided to abandon his family for a rich woman leaving his wife and children to stand for themselves. What are the nationalities of these gluttonous misers? Could they have closed the factories without buying the politicians? The answer is no. Could they have done this without a cover-up from their media? The answer is no. Selfishness, greed, I would say treason. The elite-businessmen formed an alliance against Donald Trump, why? He is the only politician who stood up and spoke out about getting the factories back to America. Don’t believe those who started to hijack his ideas after almost a year of campaigning, they found themselves loosing. They will not touch this subject when they get the presidency. They are just elite-businessmen’s pawns. If they believe in getting the factories back, they would not have waited that long to mention it during their campaigns. They just found themselves loosing. The elite-businessmen’s media: Here we are talking about all of what is called the mainstream media. Most all the news channels owned by the elite-businessmen. Trump should be proud they are all against him. Have you ever seen any other candidate being grilled by them like they grill Trump? They pressure Trump as hard as they can then they catch any of his tongue-slips. They make stories and they keep wailing and screaming about these tongue-slips non-stop!!! They ignore the real issues like jobs and economy and they look for personal issues about Trump and they talk about his personal issues nostop. While on the other hand, they avoid Hillary’s scandals. Best case scenario, they hardly mention it briefly, then they try to cast doubts on these scandals. What should the job of the media be? Showing the people the truth about what is happening. Displaying the real problems facing the people according to the people’s priorities. Explaining what is being plotted against them. That is what they are supposed to do. But, what are they really doing? Tranquilizing the people by dragging their attention to anything other than their real life problems. Entertaining the people and making them laugh and enjoy their life while the country is being set on fire. WAKE UP AMERICA!!! Have you ever seen CNN and her sister channels going with their cameras to show the closed, abandoned factories? Have you ever seen them roaming with their cameras in the streets of abandoned ghost towns? Did they interview laid off workers or the abused Walmart workers who are even being replaced by machines. Have they shown all of that on their screens? But you know what? We are on the move, and we found a father, a leader who is listening to us, and speaks and acts on our behalf. Stand Up America, The Leader Is Here. The elite-businessmen’s politicians: Welcome to the employees of the elite- businessmen. They call them Senators, Representatives and even Presidents. They belong to two owned companies that are called political parties: Republicans and Democrats. Most of these politicians in the last 50 years are bought and sold. They are playing a game they call an election. The rule of the game; let the people get indulged in ideological battles, conservatives against liberals but make sure they don’t break free from the exploitation of the elite-businessmen. It does not matter who wins, the factories were sent and being sent abroad by Republican presidents, Democratic presidents, Republican Congress, Democratic Congress etc. Were the people asked to approve or disapprove the free trade agreements? I mean were these agreements among the issues the candidates were talking about in their election campaigns before they signed them? The people are only allowed to make the country 5% more conservative or 5% more liberal. It looks like Trump is taking it far away, beyond what the people are allowed to change. Let me recite a scenario that would show how a catastrophic decision would be taken behind the people’s backs: The elite-businessmen speaking to a to-be president: You look like you can make a good president… You are smart or else we wouldn’t have approached you… We will make you president in return for a favor……. We want you to do so and so…. If you don’t follow, we will destroy you….No second term…..and/ or big scandal…. You get us angry and you are a dead dog…. End of the scenario. It is literally a deal with the devil. They ask the politician for a catastrophic decision that feeds their greed and harm the people. Listen Greedy-Hearts, no more of these dirty tricks.

“We love you, buddy, but what are you here for, if you can’t answer basic questions?” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook, was destroyed on Morning Joe Wednesday morning because he tried to tap-dance around the most basic questions about his candidate’s stands on issues. Things started to go downhill about two and a half minutes into the interview when Willie Geist asked Mook if Clinton had regrets about the way Syria was handled. Completely ignoring the question, Mook’s response was that Hillary left the State Dept. with a 70% approval rating. GEIST: What’s her biggest regret about the way Syria’s been handled? MOOK: Well, obviously, she’s been out of office for some time now. GEIST: But she was there when it started. MOOK: Well, right, but, but, uh, you know, she, I, I think she’s well regarded for her leadership as secretary of state. She came out of that office with a 70 percent approval rating. In contrast to Donald Trump, she has released a clear and decisive plan to defeat ISIS. Donald Trump has said that he thinks he knows more about it than the generals and refuses to tell us what his secret plan is. GEIST: I understand, Robby. What about in Syria, though? She supported the drawing of the red line. Obviously, she was out of office when Assad used chemical weapons. Was it a mistake to draw the red line if the president was not willing to go — to do something about it when it was crossed? MOOK: Well, as you pointed out, the decision regarding that was made after she was out of office, so I think you’d have to ask President Obama — GEIST: Was she disappointed that the president didn’t act when the line was crossed?

I can’t wait for “Weekend at Chelsea’s” to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton’s slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups – these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low – would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a “minor setback” to her “inevitable” victory. The American people aren’t buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more “conspiracy theory” dismissals. Mrs. Clinton’s “mild cold,” er, “seasonal allergies,” I mean “heat exhaustion,” that is to say “minor case of pneumonia” is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a “mystery man” who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable “episodes” (or otherwise freezes up with a brain “short-circuit” during a speech). This guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures. Blue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson’s disease – a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has “pneumonia” required a neurological squeeze test?). The Clinton campaign needs to come clean. They won’t, but they should. I wonder what official “diagnosis” we’ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they’ve been there a hundred times before. “Nothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clinton’s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ‘powered through’ yesterday going door-to-door.” The point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. She’s proven, yet again, that she can’t be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. She’s a liar. That’s her default mode. She’s corrupt. And she’s sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else – including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life. Do I take joy in Mrs. Clinton’s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. “Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice” (Proverbs 24:17). Indeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump’s supporters as a “racist” and “irredeemable” “basket of deplorables,” has only served to accelerate the plunge. Perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement – especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her “friend and mentor.” Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags – the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them. Who’s the racist? I’m praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. You can’t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be. It’s almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everything she’s ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she’s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, “Many are the plans in a person’s heart, but it is the LORD’s purpose that prevails.” Am I saying there’s no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, there’s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory. Still, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton’s political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector – a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee. When they visit her in prison.

Legendary Washington Post journalist Carl Bernstein went on CNN with Brian Stelter in the aptly named “Reliable Sources” program, when the host asked one of the least important questions on the campaign trail today – yet another inquiry into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s health. Bernstein’s response was perfect: There is a much larger question about the overall coverage of this campaign by the electronic media, by cable and network news. We’ve been terrific at interpretation at giving equal time to debate panels, but we’ve been positively awful in terms of reporting in a coherent way the biggest story of this campaign: the real existing life and records of Donald Trump. The New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal have done fabulous reporting on this and we give snippets of it.We need to be doing an hour, two hours a night of real biography, running it over and over of what Trump’s life and record have been about because they’re at absolute odds with the mythical and lying story that he has told us. He’s a con man. It’s been established. And also he has presided over a cover up of his own life. And we have allowed it in cable news and network news particularly. Few journalists in America today are more respected than Carl Bernstein and his colleague Bob Woodward, whose doggedly persistent journalism uncovered the last time Republicans broke into the Democratic National Committee for political reasons, and ultimately forced President Richard Nixon to resign from office in 1974 amidst the Watergate affair. Unlike the 1970s, this time we found out the results of the Russian invasion into DNC email servers almost immediately. Then the Republican candidate departed from all norms of political behavior by any party in America to ask his patron,Russian strongman Vladimir Putin to hack Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign servers, leading almost immediately to another electronic strike. The real question is: why hasn’t the cable television media noticed any of this and taken the time to dig further into the detailed reports, like proof that the Republican candidate faces serious racketeering charges related to Trump University, that long before the suspected labor and immigration violating Trump Models lawsuit, we found evidence of human trafficking practices in the nominee’s reality TV show productions for MTV? Every major newspaper in Florida is calling for a federal investigation of Trump University, but thus far CNN and FOX are more interested in Hillary Clinton’s health and ignoring the actual facts that Donald Trump is 70 years old, lied about his height to hide his obesity, and says that making hand gestures during rallies is “exercise.” CNN’s Stelter replied to Carl Bernstein’s sincere comment with the kind of misguided mainstream media groupthink talking points which might’ve come straight out of a campaign’s deflection and spin files, blaming the reality of Trump’s lifelong con job being under reported on “liberals” wanting to discuss facts. Bernstein shut him down without question: It’s not just liberals, I think it’s conservatives, too, there is realization that trump is a con man. And that that is a big part of the story. Look, we have reported and nobody has been tougher on Hillary Clinton especially on the server question than I, I’ve said it’s indefensible what she did with it, and we have reported on her whole life. She has been around for 25, 30 years in public on the public stage. And we know her every position and record and her life. Trump is different. We haven’t — it’s not equal. It’s disequal that we have allowed Donald Trump to play us like this and we focus on his outrageous statements which we do every day and we give equal time to those on his side and Hillary’s side debating these crazy statements and positions that he changes every day. And we analyze that, but do we go back and look at his whole business record? No. We don’t. It’s sad to watch CNN drown in the effluvia of it’s own conflicted interests, while broadcasting a Trump hotel infomercial live, and without during the hourlong advertisement for the Republican bigot mention that all of its contents were not made in the USA by the xenophobic candidate who advocates protectionism and charges $805 a night to stay in half-finished digs a few blocks from the White House, nor did CNN mention that Trump’s hotel chain is wallowing in vacancy because of the stigma attached to its name. Since when did providing actual facts become just a liberal idea in the media, rather than the purpose of America’s free press? We scratch our heads along with Carl Bernstein. Watch it here:
A man wearing a security uniform entered a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday night. He began shouting Allahu Akbar as he stabbed 9 shoppers. The attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing the person. The attacker has now been identified as Somali immigrant, Dahir Adan, a Muslim. St. Cloud Somali-American community members are the ones who identified Adan as the terrorist, reported SC Times. On Sunday ISIS claimed that Adan was one of their own. Adan’s terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey, a Muslim man attacking New York police with a meat cleaver, and a bomb exploding in Chelsea, Manhattan that injured 29 civilians on Saturday. Members and officials of the St. Cloud Somali community made a statement expressing support for the terrorist’s family. The Somali officials said that Adan was a good man as far as they knew, and that he was an “accomplished student” in high school (but of course).  St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis reported to the media that Adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer, Jason Falconer. Kleis called Falconer a hero who “happened to be in the right place at the right time.” Falconer approached Adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law. That’s when Adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him. Officer Falconer then proceeded to send Adan to Allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs. Last year the Washington Times reported that Obama’s administration had relocated almost 10-thousand Somali refugees to Minnesota. The Times went on to say that Somalis are targeted by terror groups such as ISIS for recruitment, and that one organization warned of attacks on American malls. “This population is also being targeted by Islamist terror organizations like the Islamic State and al-Shabab, a Somalia-based group with links to al Qaeda, according to U.S. officials.” “Among Minnesota-based Somali-Americans, American converts to Islam or Somali refugees, there have been numerous convictions for various levels of collaboration with Islamist terror groups, plus reports of fighting with al-Shabab or other Islamist groups.” “Al-Shabab made a propaganda video warning of an attack on shopping malls around the world, including the Mall of America in Minnesota. Al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the terror attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya two years ago, which left 67 dead.” In July of this year, World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape. In May, Voice of America News reported that ISIS has steadily grown stronger in Somalia, and that the terror organization is now a major threat. “Pro-Islamic State Somali militants have grown in numbers and are receiving financial and military support from Yemen, a top intelligence official told the VOA Somali Service.” “He said Islamic State has welcomed its Somalia branch and has started delivering supplies through their affiliate faction in Yemen.” “They received military supplies from Yemen – weapons, uniform, ISIS sent trainers who inspected their bases, and they have started sending financial support,” he said. In June, three Somalians living in Minnesota were convicted of trying to join ISIS. In July, the Somali terror group al-Shabab was approached by ISIS officials in an attempt to join forces to attack America. Department of Homeland Security documents show that while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated to the United States.  If Hillary is elected, she plans on increasing the number of Muslim refugees from Syria alone by over 500%. Breitbart News reported that under a Clinton administration, the total number of Muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone. It’s clear that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by ISIS and other terror groups. It’s clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in Minnesota. Men & women, minding their own business, had their faces slashed open, and were stabbed repeatedly by a single ISIS convert. And Hillary Clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum. Hillary cannot be allowed to become president. Under her rule, terror attacks on U.S. citizens will increase exponentially. All because she and the DNC want to pander to Islamists in the hope that they will vote Democratic, and that their party will continue to rule. A vote for Hillary is a vote for ISIS and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing American men, women, and children. Don’t vote for ISIS Hillary on November 8th. Vote Trump to Keep America Safe, and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to Allah where they belong. Selah. By Jeff Rainforth Like Jeff on Facebook Follow Jeff on Twitter 
In a day and age when government and media are larger than ever, an America-loving citizen has discovered what the Department of Justice and mainstream media have been unable (or unwillingly) to un-earth: Proof that Hillary  Clinton conspired to cover up her “un-wise” use of a private server and email scandal. Through the power of social media, a Twitter user @GOPPollAnalyst has pieced together compelling evidence that has reached the House Oversight Committee who have begun a new investigation. Paul Combetta, the IT specialist hired by Hillary Clinton during her time as Secretary of State, allegedly solicited advice on how to remove Hillary’s name from classified emails. He made his requests from the public at large through the popular message board Reddit under the screen name “stonetear” throughout the summer and fall of 2014 and left more than a few definitive breadcrumbs. In his requests for help from the public at large, Combetta asked for technical advice on how to save or delete old emails as well as how to remove email addresses of an “Unamed VIP Client” from email servers and archives. “Hello all,” one of the posts begins. “I may be facing a very interesting situation where I need to strip out a VIP’s (VERY VIP) email address from a bunch of archived email that I have both in a live Exchange mailbox, as well as a PST file. Basically, they don’t want the VIP’s email address exposed to anyone. … Does anyone have experience with something like this, and/or suggestions on how this might be accomplished?” The House Oversight Committee has begun an investigation and has asked Reddit to save all relevant posts and data. Where that investigation goes is unclear but what is clear is that the American citizenry has uncovered what the crooked media and politicians have attempted to cover-up and have been unwilling to publish: proof of Hillary’s Clinton’s criminal activity. The investigation will likely pivot based on a very simple question: is the screen name “stonetear” definitively Combetta? In not, the evidence is circumstantial. If so, the proof is indisputable and ties a direct line between Hillary Clinton and a clearly illegal cover-up. To support the argument that “stonetear” is in fact Hillary Clinton’s IT specialist, @GOPPollAnalyst has unearthed the following connections: This story has not been widely reported and likely will not as media outlets have little incentive to highlight an average American doing their job for them. As word of this discovery spreads and the evidence presented throughout this post is presented to the House Oversight Committee, the work of the American people, both as investigators like @GOPPollAnalyst and as citizen-journalists like the authors here at IPatriot, will not remain silent.

Months ago, former First Lady Laura Bush shocked Americans when she said sheâd rather vote for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton than a Republican this election. For the most part, former presidential candidate Jeb Bush and former presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush have optedÂ to stay out of this election â until now. Word of George H.W. Bushâs decision to snub the GOP by not voting for its disastrous Republican nominee just recently broke, and itâs a super provocative move because not only is Bush refusing to support his party, but he is voting for the Democratic Party instead. Itâs a controversial decision, but obviously Bush recognizes that itâs the smartest choice for the future of this country. The Trump campaign, as you can imagine, isnât taking this lightly. In an interview with CNNâs Erin Burnett, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway reacted to the elder Bushâs voting decision and couldnât have demonstrated any better how immature and bitter the campaign was about it. Conway said that although she ârespectsâ Bushâs choice, itâs ironic that heâs voting forÂ âthe wife of the man who knocked him out of the raceâ in 1992. Conway alsoÂ chalked up Bushâs decision to vote for Clinton to his emotions and âhurt feelingsâ over his sonâs loss to Trump in the primaries. She said: âThis was a bruising primary, and Jeb Bush really failed all expectationsâ¦ I know there are a lot of hurt feelings there.â You can watch the interview below: âJeb Bush really failedâ¦there are a lot of hurt feelingsâ @KellyannePolls on Bush 41 voting #Clinton https://t.co/iyhiLRgrPL â OutFrontCNN (@OutFrontCNN) September 20, 2016  This response from the Trump campaign is exactly what weâd expect it to be. The Bush familyÂ is making a responsible, informed decision during this election, and that is way too much for Trump and his minions to wrap their feeble minds around. This election is no joke â itâs about far more than Republican and Democrat parties. Itâs about saving the country from a candidate that will destroy it â and the Bushâs are smart enough to recognize that. 
The use of chemical weapons is banned throughout most civilized countries. However, the savages that comprise ISIS have certainly never been accused of being civilized… Early reports indicate that ISIS has used chemical weapons on U.S. troops in Iraq.   Several U.S. officials have claimed that ISIS fired a shell filled with Mustard Gas into Qayyara Air Base in Iraq on Tuesday where U.S. and Iraqi troops are stationed. The shell was either a rocket or an artillery shell and was promptly tested and revealed to contain a chemical agent that reports indicate was Mustard Gas. No troops were injured in the attack and no troops have yet showed any signs or symptoms of the effects of Mustard Gas. According to one official, the weapon was poorly weaponized and the chemical was of “low purity.” U.S. officials have anticipated an attack of this nature as several hundred U.S. troops remain stationed just outside of Mosul to assist Iraqi forces in taking-back Mosul from ISIS. Pentagon officials have maintained that U.S. airstrikes have been hitting locations where it is believed that ISIS is manufacturing chemicals like Mustard Gas. However, Mustard Gas is fairly easy to produce and while our airstrikes have been effective, it is unlikely that our efforts will cease production of such weapons. While President Obama and his band of weakling followers cannot be blamed for each vile act conducted by ISIS, they can be blamed for not taking seriously enough the resolve of the terrorist groups fighting to the death to kill so-called infidels. Though President Obama seems pleased with his oh-so-gentle brand of targeted airstrikes, our military engagement in the Middle East does little but inconvenience ISIS as they march onward towards more death and destruction. While Obama applies the least amount of military pressure possible, ISIS is experimenting with chemical weapons. Who seems to be taking this fight more seriously? 
This video is crazy! While I disagree with the ‘science’ of it, it nonetheless reveals how violent Black Lives Matter is. Before I show you the video I want you to understand that Black Lives Matter movement has much less to do with black people than a movement to completely destroy America and change it into something it’s not. Black Lives Matter released the platform demanding that ALL police departments be de-funded, race-based reparations for something that happened hundreds of years ago that has zero to do with any living person now, voting rights should be given illegal immigrants (unheard of anywhere else in the world), an end to private education and charter schools (as if the educational system didn’t suck enough in this country but they trust in the ‘system’ of public schools just not cops, a “universal basic income,” which is already provided to millions of Americans called welfare and free college for blacks (not anyone else’s responsibility to pay for this but you). So basically a guy stands on the sidewalk with a Black Lives Matter sign and not much happens. THEN he stands on the sidewalk with an All Lives Matter sign and all havoc breaks loose. People start behaving as if he has just said the worst insult about their mother. One guy even yelled “all lives don’t matter, only black lives matter”. That’s a pretty scary prospect when you have groups of people who start believing lives don’t matter. After I watched the video I read the comments and commented on a few. My jaw is hitting the floor reading how uneducated some of the commenters were… one of them believes America has had slavery for 600 years. I suggested he try simple math 2016-1492= NOT 600. Then someone mentioned that whites invented racism and I had to point out who sold blacks into slavery from Africa to the British. Check out the video… based on the videos of Black Lives Matter riots the past 2 years I am not surprised:   
Wouldnât it be nice if we could just kick bigots out of our country? Well, thatâs exactly what happened when anti-gay Arizona pastor Stephen Anderson stopped by BotswanaÂ for a visit and decided to preach hate. Andersonâs roadÂ  Botswana was an eventful one, with the United Kingdom banning him from so much as getting on a connecting flight in their country. This forced him to find a âroundaboutâ way to get to Botswana, where he intended to spend quite some time preaching. But after he suggested that homosexuals be stoned to death in a radio interview, Anderson learned that his hatred is not tolerated everywhere. âI have identified Steven Anderson as an undesirable person to travel to South Africa,â Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba told the BBC. The countryâs Constitution, unlike ours, prohibits hate speech against, among other things, the gay community (even though homosexual acts are illegal in Botswana) Â â and if youâve ever listened to Anderson speak for five minutes straight, you know hate speech isÂ kind of his âthing.â The government even tweeted to inform everyone he had been declared a âprohibited immigrantâ: Pastor #StevenAnderson, a #USA citizen has been declared a Prohibited Immigrant and as such is being deported from #Botswana â Botswana Government (@BWGovernment) September 20, 2016  What prompted his removal was a radio interview in which he said homosexuals should be âstoned to death.â Anderson also repeated his praise of the Pulse nightclub shooter. While he says he doesnât advocate violence, the victims were âdisgusting homosexuals who the Bible says are worthy of death, the Bible says the government should put them to death, so why would I be sad if these horrible people died that the Bible says should die anyway.â Anderson told his interviewer, who pointed out that the Bible supports slavery, that while he doesnât believe the Bible condones slavery (it does), âif it did then yes I would condone itâ because âthe Bible is always right and I am not smarter than God.â In the past, Anderson has blamed the terrorist attacks in France earlier this year on the countryâs acceptance of âf*ggots,âÂ has called the Orlando massacre âgood newsâ because a bunch of âf*ggotsâ died (he later expanded on that by adding that âperfect Christiansâ would âbatheâ in the blood of the slaughtered innocents while singing praise to God), has prayed for the death of President Obama and asked God to rip out Caitlyn Jennerâs heartÂ and even suggested executing every gay person in the world âto cure AIDS.â You can watch Anderson getting snaggedÂ by immigration officials below. If youâre anything like me, youâll play it on repeat and laugh.  You can see an interview with his camera guy here:  
It was a busy weekend for miscreant Islamist scum operating under the imprimatur of the international socialist-Islamist axis within America. On Saturday, Ahmad Khan Rahami, a New Jersey resident and naturalized immigrant from Afghanistan, detonated multiple bombs in New York and New Jersey. No one was killed, but nearly 30 people were injured. Rahami was apprehended three days later in Linden, New Jersey, after a gun battle with police. Also on Saturday, 22-year-old Dahir Adan, a Somali Muslim who had been living in the United States for the past 15 years, stabbed nine people at a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota. According to St. Cloud Police Chief William Blair Anderson, Adan –who was disguised as a security guard at the time of the attacks – “reportedly made references to Allah during the attack and asked at least one person whether they were Muslim.” Dahir was killed by police at the scene. According to the New York Times, Rahami, the man arrested for the New York and New Jersey bombings, became a “completely different person” after a trip to Afghanistan, when it is presumed he became “radicalized,” a term used by the press and politicos to describe a Muslim who crosses that obscure line from Islamic to militant Islamist. It has also been reported that Rahami made several other trips to Pakistan and Afghanistan without being detected by the U.S. government. Rahami’s father, Mohammed Rahami, told the press this week that he had reported his son to the FBI as a potential terrorist in 2014, but the agency took no action. While the Rahami and Adan stories have received wide press coverage, of course we are still being subjected to the usual spin and politically correct propaganda from the press and politicians, which deftly avoids the motive attendant to these attacks – this being that the perpetrators were Muslims and were acting based on Islamic doctrine. At this point, we’ve now seen several high-profile acts of domestic terrorism perpetrated by Muslims wherein communities and law enforcement agencies were previously made aware of the danger posed by these individuals. In all of these cases, nothing was done to mitigate the potential danger. In the case of federal law enforcement, to some extent it stands to reason that organizations such as the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security might be less motivated to counter these threats, since these are under the control of the Obama administration, whose agenda includes destabilizing America through an influx of potentially violent Muslims and the establishment of insular Muslim communities. In a speech to the United Nations this week, our bath house refugee-playing statesman president, Barack Hussein Obama, defended increasing globalization and condemned the populist nationalism that has been growing in the West in direct response to the actions of murderous Muslim émigrés and refugees. This deportment, which has included the Obama administration illegally facilitating the importation of tens of thousands of Muslims from unstable, culturally bankrupt Islamic nations, has also given rise to such debacles as the 858 people who, according to a new Department of Homeland Security inspector general’s report, were “mistakenly” granted citizenship due to a failure of the federal government’s fingerprint records system, despite having been ordered deported. This is eerily reminiscent of the jihadi training camps known to exist across the continental U.S., but which law enforcement is prohibited from engaging because the Islamist groups operating them somewhat conveniently did not make it onto the federal government’s official list of terrorist organizations. Tragically, this international socialist-Islamist axis of Western elites even includes powerful religious leaders such as Pope Francis, who regularly condemns “hateful acts of terrorism” with one breath while admonishing Europeans to “welcome refugees into your homes and communities” (the same refugees who are rioting and raping their way across that continent) with the next. With regard to the United States, this is a component of the agenda calculated to render America irrelevant as a nation of influence on the world stage. The Islamists seek global supremacy for their foul doctrine, while the socialists harbor attitudes varying from those which hold that the concept of nations itself is outmoded, to those which characterize the U.S. as last among the old-school imperialist oppressor nations that must be dismantled. A chief stratagem of the latter is of course the idea that racism practiced by those of northern European descent has been the greatest evil of the last thousand years. Erik Rush’s book on race is bold, daring and needed — now more than ever: “Negrophilia: From Slave Block to Pedestal – America’s Racial Obsession” — just $4.95! It’s a pretty safe bet that the conservative establishment press will have no interest in that upon which your humble commentator has to say regarding these matters from this point forward, since I would start with a moratorium on Muslim immigration and the summary expulsion of each and every Muslim foreign national in the United States. I would also revoke the citizenship of each and every naturalized Muslim American and deport them to their native countries, save for giving them the opportunity to renounce Islam in order to escape this fate. These people, as well as the second and third-generation descendants of Muslim émigrés, could count on ongoing surveillance to ensure their sincerity. Here, obviously, I am dispensing with the subverted notions of constitutionality popularly advanced by the left, as well as political correctness and cultural relativism. Islam is not a religion, nor should it be considered such under law; it is a retrograde system ascribed to by barbarians whose company I would typically pass on in favor of an afternoon cavorting with a troupe of lower primates.

What the hell did I just watch? Words are really failing me right now… None of what I want to say is going to make any sense to you until you watch this video yourself…so here you go. WARNING: Video might make you want to punch your screen. Don’t.  Two words popped up in my head while I was watching this video… Retarded chihuahua. I don’t even mean that as an insult. Purely descriptive wording… Boy those Liberals LOVE their First Amendment right don’t they? This woman went on and on about hers… The problem is…they love it until they disagree with what you’re saying/supporting. Then you’re a racist, misogynist, bigot, homophobe, or plug in whatever “phobe” you want here. I’m embarrassed that she’s a woman, that does not reflect any good on us at all. In fact, she is everything WRONG with America. She calls the guy a big redneck, doesn’t like what she sees on his lawn then proceeds to FLIP him off. Then makes herself the victim? The woman needs to go slap herself. The REAL victim is Ben…poor poor Ben. The kid is doomed! Then of course our poor Police Officers…this is the garbage they are having to deal with EVERYDAY now. If I were the guy she flipped off, knowing now that she has to pass the house EVERYDAY… I would put out a sign that said… Sarah: 0 Redneck: 1 I’d pay to watch the video she’d put out after seeing that sign… I really hate social justice warriors, they give me a headache. Rude. 
During the violent protests in Charlotte, NC, a protester shot into the crowd there. He wound up shooting Justin Carr in the head. At first the media reported he had died… Justin did not die until last night – he was on life support. This morning, the police apprehended the man they think killed him… Rayquan Borum. There are those saying the police killed Justin with rubber bullets. I don’t believe that at all. Surveillance video shows Borum shooting the gun that killed Justin. Lay blame where blame is due. The shooting happened the second night of the protests in Charlotte. It was an awful, bloody scene. I don’t know why anyone would just fire into the crowd like that. It makes no sense. Someone was bound to be hit and die. Maybe the guy just didn’t care. A white man was also kicked and beaten brutally in a garage by the protesters there. So much violence over a justified shooting by a black police officer. It’s as if facts don’t matter… they just want revolution in the streets.  From The Federalist Papers Project: The several nights of chaos in Charlotte, North Carolina led to the death of a man who was present at the protests; his name was Justin Carr. He was shot on Wednesday night and and died Thursday morning. Amid the chaos, it was difficult to tell exactly what happened. All we have known up until this point was that one of the protesters fired on Carr and that his injuries led to his death. However, there are new developments out of Charlotte. Fox News has more: Rayquan Borum, 21, was charged Friday morning in shooting death of Justin Carr, who died a day after being shot during protests in Trade Street, Charlotte-Mecklenberg Police Chief Kerr Putney said. Putney said surveillance footage supplied by buildings in the area helped identify the suspect. The shooting occurred Wednesday night, and Charlotte police initially said the man had died, although he survived on life support until Thursday. Witnesses gave conflicting accounts about who shot him, with some insisting they saw police gun him down with rubber bullets, while others said he was killed by a fellow protester.  Who will protest for Justin Carr? Certainly not Black Lives Matter. To them, he is a war casualty. They’ll just step over his body and riot on. There will be no marches or demands for justice for Justin. These people use others and then discard their dead bodies as they go. It’s the communist, radical way. They are now trying to lay the blame for Justin Carr’s death on the police. I don’t believe it and won’t until I see video proving it. It is far more likely it is the guy that has been arrested. My only question is did someone pay him to shoot things up?  NEW: Charlotte police chief says they've apprehended suspect in murder of Justin Carr, who was shot during protests. https://t.co/B29wwIb7wa — ABC News (@ABC) September 23, 2016      
Earlier this week, as part of an interview he gave to Fox News, Donald Trump announced he had just learned that Ford Motor Company was about to “fire all their employees in the United States and…move to Mexico.” Trump went on to add that when he becomes President, Ford would have to pay a 35 percent tax on any car they send back to the United States for sale. Wow! That’s big news! It’s also, like 99.9 percent of what Donald Trump says, a gigantic lie, according to Ford CEO Mark Fields, who told CNN: “It’s really unfortunate when politics get in the way of the facts.” CNN host Poppy Harlow then asked Fields, would Ford cut any American jobs as part of its plans to build a new manufacturing plant in Mexico? To that, Fields replied: “Absolutely not. Zero. Not one job will be lost. Most of our investment is here in the US. And that’s the way it will continue to be.”   Ford has 85,000 workers in the United States, and that number has risen by 50 percent over the last five years. It currently employs 8,800 people in Mexico, and the new plant will create 2,800 additional jobs there. So once again we see that Donald Trump will say anything at all in order to muddy the waters and make it appear that he is the savior of the American economy. That’s a powerful message, especially in the industrial heartland–states like Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin–where Trump is hoping to score big on Election Day. But Trump has financially screwed over thousands of small businesses and vendors over the years to have any legitimate clout on the economic issue. All he offers is more tax cuts for the rich and empty words. And lies. Lots and lots of lies. Tax those and we could pay off the national debt. Featured Image Via Business Trajectory  
The New York Times has announced that law enforcement have captured the man wanted in connection to this weekend’s improvised explosive detonation in Chelsea, which injured 29. After a lengthy firefight which left one police officer with non-life threatening wounds, Ahmad Khan Rahami was taken into custody in Linden, New Jersey. The police said there was “conclusive” evidence that Rahami was connected to several other devices that had failed to detonate. They were able to identify him from photos on a cellphone that had been used as a detonator but did not explode. Rahami is a naturalized citizen, born in Afghanistan in 1988. It is unclear whether or not he was a refugee or when he came to the United States. He lived in Elizabeth, NJ, where his family operated a fried chicken restaurant. Regulars at the First American Fried Chicken resturaunt described Mr. Rahami as “friendly,” noting that he dressed in Western clothing and was obsessed with “fast cars.” There are no connections as of yet to the any international terror or any indication of religious radicalization. While Republican nominee Donald Trump will surely use this as an excuse to double down on his anti-Muslim and anti-refugee platform, it should be noted that thanks to the vigilance of American citizens and the rapid response of law enforcement, there have been no deaths from the bombings and the suspect was captured extremely quickly. No change of our already lengthy vetting process would have prevented Mr. Rahami from entering the country; the parts of the IEDs are purchasable at any hardware store. We cannot allow the right-wing to use this as an evidence that their discriminatory isolationism would protect us better – because it won’t.

In another disgusting display of Donald’s Trump selfish priorities, the Republican presidential nominee rushed to defend himself and the ignorant comments he made on the New York City bombings immediately after the attack, before having any official information on the matter whatsoever. Facing major backlash from the media for his audacity, Donald Trump decided to double-down on his irresponsible comments instead of admitting he had spoken out of turn. “The Donald” claimed that not only was he was right to rush to call the attack a “bomb,” he also deserved credit from the media for having “predicted it” before they confirmed it, when in fact the media was busy doing their due diligence to present the facts and not report the event so carelessly. Trump went on Fox News to say, “What I said was exactly correct. I should be a newscaster because I called it before the news. But what I said was exactly correct and everybody says, “While he was right, he called it too soon.” Donald Trump’s priorities are clearer now more than ever. Time after time, whenever tragedy strikes, Trump finds a way to make it about himself – no condolences for the 29 injured, and his self-aggrandizing knows no bounds, even when there are American lives at stake, and sensitive material that needs to be treated with careful consideration. As of this morning, a suspect is in custody. Is this the way we should expect Donald Trump to behave if elected Commander-In Chief? Not on our watch. .@realDonaldTrump slams “dishonest” CNN for editing out Clinton reference to NYC explosion as ‘bombing’ pic.twitter.com/EG2Yy63B4y — FOX & Friends (@foxandfriends) September 19, 2016 
The attacks are here. They are not new and they are not going anywhere. They could be virtually for the most part eliminated from our shores, but that would take the leadership and a government body that was willing to go against the grain when other world leaders are in their weakness, condemning America for being ‘racists’ or ‘xenophobes’. Leadership that is willing to admit that what we have been doing up until now doesn’t work, in fact, it enables further attacks and further slaughter of American innocents. Leadership that wholeheartedly denies the erroneous communistic way of thinking known as Political Correctness.  None of these things will ever happen. They cannot happen. Not until the leaders of this nation stop weighing and measuring the quid-pro-quo way of doing business. Every day what is brought out on talk radio, on news networks, by Hollywood, is more feeling and thoughts of how to handle the day’s latest political crisis. The latest gag by Hillary Clinton or the recent back peddle by Donald Trump, and a large portion of America, the majority, is scratching their heads saying, “Are these the two best candidates in the entire nation?” Any hope of a better candidate swooping in and saving the day is a false hope. The truth is we did this to ourselves. We appoint our elected officials and they in turn make the decisions that we as a town, city, county, state and a nation have to deal with. One of those major decisions is how we combat terrorism. I say terrorism because we as a people can’t even come to the same conclusion that terrorism for a very long time has solely been perpetrated by Islamic fundamentalists. After this weekend’s attacks, America has been reminded that the war isn’t over. The war on our culture and way of life rages on, even if the tragedys are out of sight, out of mind. Senator Ted Cruz has released a statement that is dubbed ‘a clear-eyed’ approach to combating terrorism: “Terrorist attacks over the last several days across our homeland, from Manhattan to Minnesota, indicate we are moving into a new phase of the war against ISIS and al Qaida, who are increasingly targeting Europe and the United States. Two years ago, a focused, aggressive military campaign against ISIS’s claimed caliphate in Syria and Iraq might have effectively destroyed the terrorist group, but ISIS has instead spent the last year seeding radicals in the West, disguising jihadis as refugees and radicalizing Muslim citizens online and encouraging them to remain in the U.S. and fight here. Meanwhile, other networks such as al Qaida and the Taliban remain determined to resume the attacks on America that began on September 11, 2001. As we confront this new phase, we must avoid the trap of misconceiving these attacks as isolated incidents somehow disconnected from the larger ideological struggle against jihad. It is past time to take off the blinders and call the enemy what it is: radical Islamic terrorism engaged in a coordinated campaign designed to disrupt our very way of life. We must start by fully supporting our law enforcement community, from the heroic off-duty officer Jason Falconer, who neutralized the terrorist in the St. Cloud mall, saving many lives, to the FBI officers in New York who have worked swiftly to identify and apprehend the likely mastermind of the weekend bombings. We also desperately need the active participation of American Muslims who see the jihadis for what they are: the enemies of all who celebrate freedom and tolerance. Congress should act to prevent Americans who have traveled abroad for training from returning here, and to stop the flow of refugees from hotbeds of terrorism in the Middle East that President Obama is determined to bring to our country. We can’t overcome our enemies by pretending they don’t exist, and undermining our first line of defenders. Only together, clear-eyed and determined, can we defeat this foe.”   The first step is recognizing that we have a problem. Ted Cruz, as well as so many other patriots have. But none of this is going to have even a remote chance of coming to fruition if we as citizens continue to choose leaders that have proven themselves to be corrupt and unworthy stewards of this God-given nation. 
According to Homeland Security’s Inspector General, at least 858 immigrants from foreign countries that pose national security risks, as well as those from countries with high immigration fraud who had orders to have them deported were “mistakenly” granted citizenship. An internal Homeland Security audit was released Monday, which documented the “mistake.” The Associated Press reports: The report does not identify any of the immigrants by name, but Inspector General John Roth’s auditors said they were all from “special interest countries” — those that present a national security concern for the United States — or neighboring countries with high rates of immigration fraud. The report did not identify those countries. DHS said the findings reflect what has long been a problem for immigration officials — old paper-based records containing fingerprint information that can’t be searched electronically. DHS says immigration officials are in the process of uploading these files and that officials will review “every file” identified as a case of possible fraud. The gap was created because older, paper records were never added to fingerprint databases created by both the now-defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service and the FBI in the 1990s. ICE, the DHS agency responsible for finding and deporting immigrants living in the country illegally, didn’t consistently add digital fingerprint records of immigrants whom agents encountered until 2010. And this is what happens when government puts its nose in things like healthcare and other unconstitutional things it usurps its authority to meddle in. If the central government had been focused only on the things it is authorized to deal with, this matter would more than likely never have occurred. Not only that, but you can rest assured that no one will be held accountable in the matter. While DHS is blaming paper issues and fingerprints, there were some of those who were awarded citizenship that were set to be deported. While Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee Michael McCaul called on ICE to have all immigration fingerprints digitized, but the threat to national security is great since citizens can apply and obtain security clearances or take jobs which are security sensitive. According to Roth, at least three of these new citizens acquired aviation or transportation worker credentials, granting them access to secure areas in airports or maritime facilities and vessels. He went on to state that their credentials were revoked once it was discovered that they had been given citizenship mistakenly. He also said that another individual had been given the role of a law enforcement officer. While changes were recommended and DHS agreed with them and said they would work to implement them, this problem has been going on for years. According to the AP report, “The government has known about the information gap and its impact on naturalization decisions since at least 2008 when a Customs and Border Protection official identified 206 immigrants who used a different name or other biographical information to gain citizenship or other immigration benefits, though few cases have been investigated.” What has really been done about it? Nothing. Are we really to expect something new?

HILLARY CLINTON PLAYING THE POOR PITIFUL LITTLE GIRL AGAINST THE BIG BAD TRUMP WON’T WORK WITH THE TERRORIST, LITTLE KIM IN KOREA, IRAN OR RUSSIA. 
Scott Adams, the creator of the Dilbert cartoon, wrote a blog post about switching his endorsement from Hillary Clinton to Donald Trump, and it’s a great read. Adams was ready to help make Herstory until Hillary proposed her most recent tax plan, which includes raising estate taxes, which Adams views (correctly) as “robbery by government.” In case you hadn’t heard, Hillary wants to force people with a net worth of over $500 million to give the government SIXTY-FIVE PERCENT of their riches.  Well over half, you guys.   And worse, as Adams points out, the actual plan would result in increased taxes on lower value estates too.  And these estate taxes would be ON TOP OF the income taxes that have already been paid.   Adams paints the picture: In my case, a dollar I earn today will be taxed at about 50% by various government entities, collectively. With Clinton’s plan, my remaining 50 cents will be taxed again at 50% when I die. So the government would take 75% of my earnings from now on. There’s a good reason Adams opposes the estate tax, and there’s a good reason you should too: I oppose the estate tax because I was born to modest means and worked 7-days a week for most of my life to be in my current position. (I’m working today, Sunday, as per usual.) And I don’t want to give 75% of my earnings to the government. (Would you?) How does anyone defend such a proposition?  It’s theft, plain and simple. As you might expect from a hilarious cartoonist, Adams also gives snarky reasons he’s switching his vote.  Like this one: It seems to me that Trump supporters are planning for the world’s biggest party on election night whereas Clinton supporters seem to be preparing for a funeral. I want to be invited to the event that doesn’t involve crying and moving to Canada. Adams explains Trump’s strategy in a way that even Trump’s top strategists should be taking note of, because it’s perfect: Trump always takes the extreme position on matters of safety and security for the country, even if those positions are unconstitutional, impractical, evil, or something that the military would refuse to do. Normal people see this as a dangerous situation. Trained persuaders like me see this as something called pacing and leading. Trump “paces” the public – meaning he matches them in their emotional state, and then some. He does that with his extreme responses on immigration, fighting ISIS, stop-and-frisk, etc. Once Trump has established himself as the biggest bad-ass on the topic, he is free to “lead,” which we see him do by softening his deportation stand, limiting his stop-and-frisk comment to Chicago, reversing his first answer on penalties for abortion, and so on. If you are not trained in persuasion, Trump look scary. If you understand pacing and leading, you might see him as the safest candidate who has ever gotten this close to the presidency. That’s how I see him. Adams attributes Trump’s suitability for the role of president to his persuasive personality: Most of the job of president is persuasion. Presidents don’t need to understand policy minutia. They need to listen to experts and then help sell the best expert solutions to the public. Trump sells better than anyone you have ever seen, even if you haven’t personally bought into him yet. You can’t deny his persuasion talents that have gotten him this far. No.  You really can’t deny his persuasion talents. 41 more days, y’all.  41 more days.

Sharia law is one of the greatest evils of mankind and women are overwhelmingly the subject of this evil. Yet somehow, so-called “feminists” turn a completely blind eye to it. Women can be oppressed and victimized with not even a peep about the injustice of it all. The latest example that will surely not bother today’s feminists comes out of Turkey, where a woman was kicked in the face by a man for committing the crime of wearing shorts. The kicker is that a Turkish court declared that he had done nothing wrong. 23 year-old Ayşegül Terzi works as a nurse in Istanbul and she was riding a bus when her attire caused a Muslim man on board to fly into a rage. So, he did what comes naturally — for Muslim men who follow Sharia law anyway. He violently attacked her, kicking her in the face while screaming, “Those wearing shorts must die!”   Three other men tried to step in and stop the attack. The entire brouhaha was also caught on camera. The 35 year-old man responsible was caught and he confessed to everything. He admitted to police that he attacked the woman, saying, “The shorts she was wearing were not appropriate. That’s why I was angry and behaved so.” Insanely, the Turkish court agreed with him. He was released when the court found that he had done nothing wrong. And while American pretend feminists couldn’t care less about the plight of Turkish women who live in fear and oppression, actual feminists in Turkey have been speaking out about the violence against women. Hundreds of women are killed every year, many times by their husbands.   But of course, why should anyone worry about things like spontaneous violent attacks because of the clothes women are wearing, or the systemic abuse and even murder of wives by their husbands? Clearly, that’s not real oppression. Real oppression is what women in the United States go through, because they have to wait a day or two before they can get an abortion and they have to pay for it themselves. And sometimes, on college campuses, people say things that women don’t like. Why is everyone so worried about Muslim women when it’s American women that have the real problems… right, feminists? This is why modern feminism is such a joke. These harpies whine about utterly inconsequential garbage, while actual women are suffering. They should really be ashamed. 
Donald Trump Jr. has jammed his foot squarely in his mouth once again, with a particularly offensive tweet which compared Syrian refugees fleeing chlorine gas and napalm to “poisoned Skittles.” This image says it all. Let’s end the politically correct agenda that doesn’t put America first. #trump2016 pic.twitter.com/9fHwog7ssN — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) September 19, 2016  Let’s be very clear. The United States does not have a Syrian refugee problem. Our nation has accepted ten thousand refugees from Syria, a paltry number of the 4.6 milion Syrians that have been displaced by the horrifying violence of the Syrian Civil War. None of them have been connected to any domestic terrorist attacks in the United States, all of which have been committed by naturalized citizens, but the Donald Trump campaign continues to demonize these desperate people trying to escape the appalling bloodshed in their homeland. As NPR noted, “the odds of being killed by a refugee in a terrorist attack are about 1 in more than 3.6 billion, according to a recent Cato Institute study.” The company which makes Skittles, Wrigley’s, reached out to Hollywood reporter Seth Abramovitch with this epic response, which really says it all.  For the so-called party of “family values” to be fear-mongering over women and children running for their lives is the height of hypocrisy. We’d like to see a self-entitled dandy like Donald Trump Jr. walk a day in their shoes. Here’s the somber reality of the situation: @DonaldJTrumpJr This is the refugee crisis. Not skittles. This. #SkittlesWelcome @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/IYPIUwTHdv — Sheila G. (@Sheila_Gotti) September 20, 2016 
The government’s answer to every failed program or ineffective federal department is to dump more taxpayer money in it. Ever since government education has become the norm, kids are dumb and dumber. But big government advocates claim that the problem is that they just don’t have enough money. So, they throw more money at it, and the problems only get bigger. Ever since the War on Drugs was declared, we’ve spent over $1.5 trillion, and drug use remains unchanged or even worse. But instead of questioning the policy or considering the Constitutionality of the issue, their answer is to throw more money at it, in hopes that they’ll finally stamp out illegal drug usage once and for all. But it only gets worse. The same is true with the “War on Terror.” The U.S. government dumped $5 trillion into it, terrorism has increased by leaps and bounds. But instead of reevaluating our foreign policy – especially pertaining to the Middle East – the politicians’ answer is to expand our foreign policy, and of course, throw more money at it. And terrorism continues to grow. From Zero Hedge: According to a report released by Dr. Neta Crawford, professor of political science at Brown University, spending by the United States Departments of Defense, State, Homeland Security, and Veteran Affairs since 9/11 is now close to $5 trillion USD. Before we have the chance to ask how a country that has racked up over $19.3 trillion USD in debt can spend $5 trillion USD on war, the focus of this article is to ask: What has all of this spending achieved? As Reader Supported News reported at the end of last year, terrorism has increased 6,500 percent since 2002 (they probably should rename it “the war of terror”). In 2014, the outlet noted, it was reported that 74 percent of all terror-related casualties occurred in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, or Syria. As stated by Paul Gottinger, a staff reporter for Reader Supported News, out of the aforementioned countries, “only Nigeria did not experience either U.S. air strikes or a military occupation in that year.” Omitted from that assessment is the fact that the U.S. has been meddling in Nigeria for some time now. Why wouldn’t they? Until recently, Nigeria was Africa’s largest oil producer, as well as the continent’s largest economy until last month. And look at this shocker from Ben Swann: “Before the 2003 U.S. invasion, do you know how many suicide attacks there were in Iraq? None. In the country’s history there had never been one. But since the 2003 invasion, there have been 1,892. “In Iraq, prior to the start of the Iraq war, there were reportedly just over 1.5 million Christians living in that country. And yet shortly after the war started, more than one million of them fled to Syria. That didn’t work out well. Today fewer than half a million Christians remain and yet are being exterminated by groups like ISIS.” The more terrorism grows and is a threat to our national security, the more laws the U.S. government passes that not only continually erode away at our freedoms, but do nothing to protect us.

S Trump’s number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company’s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA. Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment’s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump’s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that: According to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. “The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,” the lawsuit says. Ironically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee’s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel’s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he’s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether. Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan’s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire’s then-secret sexual orientation. But now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP’s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, “Every American has a unique identity. I’m proud to be gay, I’m proud to be a Republican,” after a lengthy rant against “government incompetence.” He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period. Unfortunately, his own party didn’t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s. “Federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,” said the Department of Labor’s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. “Our nation’s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.” Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself “vigorously” and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News. Now, the executive who accused his employer – the federal government – of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company’s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary. 
Dashboard camera and helicopter footage of Tulsa, Oklahoma police killing 40-year-old Terence Crutcher contradict the police account of the shooting. On Friday, September 16, Crutcher, a father of four, was heading home from music appreciation class at Tulsa Community College when his SUV broke down in the middle of 36th Street North and Lewis Avenue. Shortly after police arrived on the scene, Crutcher, who had no weapon on his person or in his vehicle, was shot and killed with his hands in the air. New York Daily News columnist Shaun King tweeted the dash cam video, which shows police killing Crutcher at the 17-second mark: The @TulsaPolice Execution of #TerenceCrutcher. Shot fired at 0:17. Then they abandon him. ARREST THEM RIGHT NOW pic.twitter.com/SHgQb1MVlQ — Shaun King (@ShaunKing) September 19, 2016  Tulsa police spokeswoman Jeanne MacKenzie told the Associated Press that Crutcher was uncooperative with officers who arrived on the scene. “He refused to follow commands given by the officers,” MacKenzie told the AP. “They continued to talk to him, he continued not to listen and follow any commands.” However, helicopter footage obtained and published by the Tulsa World shows Crutcher had his hands up the entire time during his fatal encounter with responding officers. In the helicopter footage, a police officer is heard saying, “That looks like a bad dude, too. Probably on something.”  Video of Crutcher’s killing has gone viral on social media. One Twitter user pointed out the discrepancy with how officers killed Crutcher within minutes of arriving, compared to how police in New York City apprehended the Chelsea bombing suspect alive after a shootout. The #NYC bomber gets taken alive but a Black man in full surrender gets gunned down and left to bleed out in the street. #TerenceCrutcher — Kris Stewart (@krisinreelworld) September 19, 2016  According to the Tulsa World, U.S. Attorney Danny Williams has confirmed the United States Department of Justice has opened a separate civil rights investigation into Crutcher’s death that will run parallel to the investigation conducted by the State of Oklahoma. In an interview with the , pastor Rodney Goss, of the Morning Star Baptist Church in Tulsa, said the police department’s account of events is completely contradictory with video evidence. “His hands were in the air from all views,” Goss said. “It was not apparent at any angle from any point that he lunged, came toward, aggressively attacked, or made any sudden movements that would have been considered a threat or life-threatening toward the officer.” Officer Betty Shelby, who fired the shot that killed Crutcher, has been placed on paid administrative leave.        
Clemson University freshmen may no longer publicly display Harambe-related memes because they “add to rape culture” and can be “a form of racism.” The ban was allegedly inspired by an incident that occurred last week, but administrators are refusing to divulge any details. A Clemson administrator sent an email to Resident Advisors (RAs) Friday instructing them to demand that freshman remove all Harambe references from dorm hallways and windows. The administrator claimed Harambe’s death has been used to “add to rape culture” and can be “form of racism.” An RA further added that any student who disobeys these instructions will be “in trouble.” “All Harambe references are no longer allowed within our community.” “We are no longer allowing any reference to Harambe (or any other spelling) to be displayed on doors, halls, billboards, or windows,” the instructions state. “Harambe should not be displayed in a public place or a place that is viewed by the public… Read the rest of the story at Campus Reform  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.
Donald Trump is most criticized for his temperament to the point of many saying it disqualifies him from the office of president. Lets look at Trumps objectionable temperament and then see what it has to do with being president. Mark Mellman made these observations “…a crucial contrast on character is frankly much more powerful than when you make a contrast on policy.” This is why we are looking at character in the first place, so we do not look at failed policies. Dr. Frank said, “Most of my colleagues feel that he’s not crazy, and if he is crazy, he’s crazy like a fox,”. Dan P. Adams,who analyzes character traits concluded not surprisingly, that Donald Trump has “sky-high extroversion combined with off-the-chart low agreeableness (the extent to which a person appears to be caring, loving, affectionate, polite, and kind). Anger may be the operative emotion behind Trump’s high extroversion as well as his low agreeableness. Anger can fuel malice, but it can also motivate social dominance, stoking a desire to win the adoration of others. Trump may be a more flexible and pragmatic decision maker, more like Bill Clinton than Bush. Decision makers who, like Nixon, who are dispositionally low on agreeableness might hold certain advantages when it comes to balancing competing interests or bargaining with adversaries.” Many other presidents ranked high in these traits. Among them was Lyndon Johnson who scored the highest, followed closely by Teddy Roosevelt, Andrew Jackson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton. Trump’s personality type is classified as a Promoter. Other non-presidents who fit this category are Ernest Hemingway, Eva Peron, Winston Churchill, Grace Slick, Madonna, George S. Patton, and Steve Jobs. “They are Bold and daring at heart, and ever-optimistic that things will go their way. Promoters will take tremendous risks to get what they want, and seem exhilarated by walking close to the edge of disaster. Because of this, they make the very best trouble-spot administrators and negotiators, and they can be outstanding entrepreneurs, able to swing deals and kick-start enterprises in a way no other type can.” says Dan Adams, Take Andrew Jackson for example. His campaign centered on Jackson’s image as a man of the people battling aristocracy and corruption. Strong-willed and sharp-tempered, a fierce patriot and rabid partisan, Jackson was always controversial. He personalized disputes and demonized opponents. Yet behind Jackson’s towering rages often lay shrewd calculation of their political effects. Jackson’s quick temper was notorious. His audacity on behalf of the people earned him enemies who slandered him. Jackson was often in control of his rage, and used it (and his fearsome reputation) as a tool to get what he wanted in his public and private affairs. His opponents were terrified of his temper: Observers likened him to a volcano, and only the most intrepid or recklessly curious cared to see it erupt. He believed that the president is not just an executive but also a representative of all the people. He entered office determined to end government corruption and the nation’s financial difficulties caused, he thought, by the upper-class elite in government, business, and finance.(Taken from a variety of historical sources). Rather than disqualifying Donald Trump, his temperament may make him the most qualified. Like Andrew Jackson, we may not like him, but if we are looking for a more flexible and pragmatic decision maker,who may hold certain advantages when it comes to balancing competing interests or bargaining with adversaries, someone who is bold and daring at heart, and ever-optimistic that things will go the right way for the American people, able to take tremendous risks to get what he wants, the very best trouble-spot administrator and negotiator, able to swing deals and kick-start the economy in a way no other can, then we might have to overlook the baggage that comes with Donald Trump. 
George Bush Sr. is now 92 years-old. Do you remember him? He was the 41st President of the United States and gave an infamous speech for the 1991 State of the Union where he famously said: “What is at stake is more than one small country; it is a big idea: a new world order, where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind — peace and security, freedom and the rule of law. Such is a world worthy of our struggle and worthy of our children’s future.” Calling the United States a ‘small country’ was insult enough, but to decide to use America as a tool to ‘achieve universal aspirations of mankind’ is quite another. Mankind doesn’t have any ‘Universal aspirations’. It’s hard enough to get Americans within the same culture to agree on one thing, let alone the whole world of many cultures. I am no conspiracy theorist, but the phrase ‘New World Order’ was coined by our 41st President, so we will have this discussion with that one thing in mind.   It was reported that George H.W. Bush and former First Lady Barbara Bush wanted to stay silent about the upcoming race for the Presidency and who they support. But former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy wanted to find out who Bush Sr. was supporting for the Presidency. She asked him and then immediately took a selfie with him and posted his response on Facebook.   “The President told me he’s voting for Hillary!!” In a telephone interview, Townsend said she met with the former president in Maine earlier today, where she said he made his preference known that he was voting for a Democrat. “That’s what he said,” she told POLITICO. Asked about Townsend’s post, George H.W. Bush spokesman Jim McGrath in an email replied, “The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days. He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim.” I guess my question to you is this: Does it surprise you that the man who said the United States is small and that we must unite in a ‘New World Order’ might be voting for Hillary Clinton? They are very similar in belief. While President, Bush Sr. allowed many of the U.N. entrapments to sneak past our Congress. He introduced the U.N.’s Common Core education, which is an arm of Agenda 21 into our education system in the 90’s. Hillary Clinton also believes the United States to be small and should be more under the reign of U.N. treaties and such. They are not very different at all. Now Trump? That guy is not part of that elite group trying to ‘achieve the universal aspirations of mankind’. He’s all for himself which means in turn he would be the kind of President who would be ALL about the United States. He doesn’t believe the U.S. is one small country, like a cog in a machine. Trump believes that the U.S. IS the machine. Trump’s are not the type of ideals that Bush wants in the White House. It’s dangerous because before you know it the United States would become a sovereign nation in the world once again and then what happens to all the Bush’s and Clinton’s work? Many former GOP officials from both Bush administrations have also announced their support for Clinton over Trump, including national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez. One Bush official who has taken Trump’s side is former Vice President Dan Quayle, who told POLITICO in an interview this summer he was still holding out hope both Bushes would back Trump. “Clearly in their heart of hearts I should hope they would want a Republican president, but they can speak for themselves,” Quayle said in an interview in July. Dan Quayle was such a stud and polar opposite to GHW Bush. It was very sad for our country to end up with Bush Sr. after Reagan and not a Dan Quayle. 
As news of more frequent police shootings appear in the media. People are asking why is this happening more now than before. Many theories have been proposed.   More crime… more drug use.. and so on.  There is one that has not been mentioned unitl now.  You heard it here first. When did the police shootings begin to increase? Was it in the 2000s..?  the teens? Or the 1960s..70s .. 80s or 1990s…?  Even during the riotous years of the sixtys  there were not as many LEO ..law enforcement officer ..shootings. I  recall many years when officers said they had gone an entire career without firing their weapon on duty.   A cursory search seems to indicate these shootings began more often from about the late 1980s on to present. That was about the same time  an officer Dennis Tueller in Salt Lake City introduced his study on timing of attacks.  This has become widely known among LEO  departments all across the country as The Tueller Drill. This same drill is also trained in concealed carry classes. How long does it take an attacker to get to you from a standing position? Think about that for a moment, imagine a BG bad guy standing twenty one feet from you. He has a knife or a bat.  How long do you think it would take?   Tueller found that from about twenty one feet.. it takes an attacker about two seconds, or less to get to you.  Two  seconds. So  beginning in the 1980s  LEO depeartments begain to train officers in the Tueller Drill.   Bad Guy. Knife. Twenty one feet.  No warning signal. You act when he moves toward you. Draw and fire. Now you can see what I believe is one of  the arguably biggest reasons for many of the now familiar shootings.  This is not to condemn the Tueller drill or LEOs for using it.  It is well founded an well  reasoned.    This is simply to inform why its happening .  If anything the burden is on the guy standing in front  of an officer.  Don’t charge an officer.  You will regret it.

This Sunday, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick once again knelt in protest of police brutality during the national anthem of another NFL game. The very next day, video of yet another African-American being shot to death by police went viral, notwithstanding the fact that the victim, 40-year-old, Terence Crutcher, was unarmed and had his hands up at the time of his death. “His car was broken down, he was looking for help and he got murdered,” Kaepernick said. “That’s a perfect example of what [my protest] is about. I think it will be very telling what happens with the officers that killed him because everybody’s eyes will be on this.” The day after the footage of Crutcher’s murder was released, the response immediately affected Charlotte, North Carolina as riots spread throughout the area’s poorest neighborhoods. Kapernick took to Twitter to lament the tragedy and reassert his position, but his argument had already been proven for him in the worst way by police. With his protests, Kaepernick originally brought more attention to his disrespect for “the flag” than to police brutality due to the media’s fixation with his kneeling during the national anthem. But the death of Terence Crutcher served as a reminder of the point, the ruthlessness with which police treat people of color in America. “There’s a lot of racism in this country disguised as patriotism,” Kaepernick said, “and people want to take everything back to the flag but that’s not what we’re talking about. We’re talking about racial discrimination, inequalities and injustices that happen across this nation.” According to the Guardian, 1,146 people were killed at the hands of the police last year. So far in 2016, police have killed more than 706 people according to the Washington Post and 790 according to the Guardian. And since Kaepernick’s protest began, police have killed at least 67 people. Of these numbers, an unevenly high percentage of those killed by police have been African-Americans. And while the number of incidents with police would suggest a high likelihood of indictment of aggressors, police are almost never convicted of wrongdoing in cases involving police officers, even when there is video evidence of lawbreaking. All of this points away from an isolated event and towards a larger institutional issue with American law enforcement. And as the tally climbs higher every day, it becomes easier and easier to expose the faux-patriotism used to critique of Kaepernicks’ protest, as just another way to avoid having a serious conversation about racial injustice in this country and to punish a person of color for daring to question the status quo.
I honestly don’t know what happened to the NFL. It was once an organization that promoted the best of sportsmanship. People like Vince Lombardi, George Halas and Tom Landry all exuded a quiet dignity that permeated the sport.   Today, we’re left with endless showboats, back-talk from multi-millionaire primadonnas and now displays of outright contempt for their country. For some reason, the NFL as an organization has allowed these spoiled children to do whatever they want and the sport has greatly suffered as a result. Still, those that remember the good ol’ days of gridiron grit aren’t having it. Legendary coach Mike Ditka recently weighed in on the controversy surrounding several ingrates who refuse to stand for the national Anthem. Directing his comments to Colin Kaepernick, the beginner of this nauseating trend, Ditka had some strong words. When asked in a recent interview what he thought about Kaepernick, Ditka let loose: “I think it’s a problem, anybody who disrespects this country and the flag. If they don’t like the country, they don’t like our flag, get the hell out. That’s what I think. “So if you’re asking me, I have no respect for Colin Kaepernick. He probably has no respect for me, that’s his choice. My choice is that I like this country, I respect our flag. And I don’t see all the atrocities going on in this country that people say are going on. “I see opportunities if people want to look for opportunity. Now, if they don’t want to look for them, then you can find problems with anything, but this is the land of opportunity because you can be anything you want to be if you work. Now, if you don’t work, that’s a different problem.” Ditka has also blasted President Obama as the “worst president we’ve ever had” and voiced disapproval for the 2014 incident in which some Rams players put up a “hands up, don’t shoot” gesture in solidarity with Michael Brown, a thug who was killed after attacking a police officer. This country as a whole needs to get a lot tougher and needs to reject this breed of radicalism that is tearing our country apart. Our nation is not perfect, but I’m with Ditka; if America is so damn bad, feel free to play for the Canadian league. 
Okay, I have to admit that last night I ONLY watched the debate to see Hillary have a seizure, collapse at the podium or go into a weird coughing fit like she does. None of those things happened. As a matter of fact everything about her look was flawless… makeup, wrinkles (where did they go my mom asked), new highlights, perfectly coiffed hair. I wondered how after months of strange episodes of coughing fits, falling, unable to walk up stairs without help, shuddering that looks like mini-seizures; how she was able to stand up for the entire debate without assistance. The first half of the debate, her eyelids looked heavy, but that went away about halfway through when whatever they gave her kicked in. My friend Nancee Jones said that she “was disappointed in Trump tonight but? he was going up against a Politician (which he is not) and a CONGENITAL LIAR. I don’t know if she specifically LIED tonight (maybe about him supporting the Iraq war??) but she is also a sociopath. There are two more debates and I DO PRAY he comes in better prepared and can get some zingers in there on those.” I agree, I was excited to watch Trump the first half, but then whatever Hillary took (conjecture) kicked in, she was like a general on a warpath. She didn’t care that her red suit already made her look aggressive, she allowed the claws to come out. She did an excellent job baiting Trump and the poor untrained debater, Trump, took that bait every time. Despite everyone agreeing that Hillary got the better of Trump, even the Liberal panel from PBS News Hour looked downtrodden, even dejected over her performance. Yes, Hillary won, but they complained that Hillary didn’t put out anything substantive. They didn’t feel the ‘leg tingle’ so to speak about her performance. They didn’t even look very enthusiastic that she had just wiped the floor with Trump’s expensive blond hair (that is NOT a hairpiece, I’ve seen it in person). Even Liberal CNN’s David Gergen said that Hillary didn’t do ENOUGH. Headline for his recent post states that: ‘Clinton crushed Trump, but was that enough?’ Coming into the presidential debate, I thought that if Hillary Clinton won decisively, she would virtually lock up the election. Coming out, it was clear that she did win decisively, but I suspect that the campaign will remain ferociously close. For one thing, Trump supporters aren’t judging him by traditional standards. They have heard establishment politicians over-promise and under-deliver for so long that they crave something different. They were quick last night to see yet more signs of media bias. Trump was an angry figure, yes, but he is also giving voice to their anger. Equally to the point, Mrs. Clinton seemingly struggled in the debate to create closer emotional bonds with voters. She has been vexed with the issue of likability throughout this campaign and in recent months her team has become concerned about her ability to mobilize millennials in the way that Barack Obama did so successfully. While Hillary ‘won’ because her ‘arguing was good’, she lost because even her own people don’t feel a ‘connection’ to her. Of course they wouldn’t, she’s a monster. Someone else was happy that Hillary turned up such a turd at the debate and he doesn’t get to vote for either candidate. My favorite fact about the debacle last night called a debate is that there are whole stories on what ‘Putin’ thought of the debate… because we really care. In reality, we don’t, we’re still ‘Merica but it’s funny to see how interested the world still is in the United States. Russia’s state-run media practically announced that: Trump Won Putin’s Focus Group and judging from Russia’s state-sponsored Twitter coverage of the presidential debate, the Kremlin is anything but a swing state.   Presidential Candidates FIRST Debate 2016 Scandals  Gennifer Flowers: The first scandal of the debate erupted over the weekend as the candidates traded tweets over who they would invite to watch the debate live in New York. Hillary first announced plans to invite Mark Cuban, who has been critical of Trump, to which Trump responded with a threat to invite former Bill Clinton mistress Gennifer Flowers. Trump’s quips are amazingly similar to the way I would respond to other’s nastiness. I really loved his twitter response:  If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2016    Hi Donald. You know I'm in your corner and will definitely be at the debate!… — Gennifer Flowers (@gennflowers) September 24, 2016   Podium-gate: The next point of contention proves that “size does matter”, at least to Hillary Clinton. Last week, Hillary’s team demanded a step stool for their candidate so that the 5’4″ Hillary wouldn’t look small and frail beside the larger 6’2″ Trump. While the debate commission denied the step stool they did allow a “custom-made” podium which was presumably scaled down by exactly 14% to match Hillary’s relative stature…this is the status of American politics folks. Here’s a look at the podiums to be used last night:   Ear Mics: The next scandal arose out of the last Commander in Chief forum hosted by Matt Lauer in which Hillary was accused of wearing an ear piece so as to receive guidance from advisers during the discussion. According to the World Tribune, the issue prompted one Maryland voter to write a letter to the Federal Elections Commissioner, Matthew Petersen, seeking assurances that ear pieces would not be allowed though no such assurances were provided. That said, Carlos Greer, of the Commission on Presidential Debates, sent out a message to news organizations on Sept. 9 banning devices that would allow presidential debate moderators get directions from their news teams.   
The rioting in Charlotte has practically crippled the city. Businesses were looted, windows were smashed. So-called protesters have committed any number of crimes, from arson and assault, to murder. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory was forced to declare a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to get the situation under control. And now, government officials have had enough too. They just made a huge announcement that will have people thinking twice before they start protesting again.   Officials just released a proclamation that says any people caught rioting, looting, destroying property or otherwise being violent in any unlawful manner will have their government benefits permanently revoked. But it doesn’t end there — any minor children who participate in the violence will face the same repercussions… and so will their parents. The parents of minors caught rioting will not only be held accountable for their child’s actions, but they could face losing their state benefits as well. They could also face referrals to social services and could potentially lose custody of their children. “Parents are responsible for their children. If they are allowing them to engage in lawless behaviors there will be consequences for them as parents,” city official Wilson Stewart said during a press conference. “Many of the individuals we have detained are high school students. We urge parents out there to know where their children are at all times until tensions are quelled. Have them adhere to the mandatory curfew. Make them aware that participation in looting, destruction of property and violently demonstrating on any level will come with severe penalties.”   Will this keep protesters from turning violent? Will it prevent thugs from exploiting a tragic death so they can have an excuse to riot and loot and attack people? Only time will tell, but at least now they will know that there are serious consequences to their actions. Parents may also be more inclined to keep an eye on their kids and you know… act like parents. Let’s be real, if your kid is caught rioting and looting, then there’s a good chance you’re not doing a good job at parenting. Officials have also put a curfew into place as they work to restore peace and order in Charlotte.   
Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns. That has been made clear as she has never shied away from shilling for gun control. But the National Rifle Association isn’t going to let her get away with it without a fight. They’ve already released a good number of brutal ads targeting Hillary, but the newest one points out how, if Hillary is elected, she will do everything she can to leave you defenseless.   Hillary, and her liberal anti-gun followers, will of course try to claim that all they want is “common sense” gun reform. But what Hillary wants isn’t just some kind of mild gun reform, like requiring a background check before someone can purchase a gun. She wants things like a 25% tax on guns and refuses to say that she believes that the Second Amendment is constitutional. She even praised the Australian gun buyback program, where Australian citizens had their guns confiscated by the government. Of course, Hillary doesn’t hate all guns. She just doesn’t want Americans to be armed. She has armed security guards protecting her every single day, so she doesn’t have to worry about potentially defending herself in a life-or-death situation. She also doesn’t care if you ever need to defend yourself. She’s safe and that’s all that matters. She wants to force you to rely on the government for protection.   That’s why the NRA’s new ad works. People don’t want to be defenseless. Police officers are fantastic and they risk their lives every day to protect Americans… but they can’t be everywhere at once. If someone is in danger, it will take police a few minutes to get there. And without guns, there is literally nothing they can do to defend themselves. Hillary’s plan actually does leave Americans defenseless. Worst of all, gun control doesn’t work. Look at Chicago, with their super strict gun control laws. They still have some of the highest gun violence numbers in the country. Australia still has problems with gun violence, particularly with gangs and drug dealers, despite forcibly confiscating people’s guns. Gun control doesn’t work. And that’s why liberals like Hillary have to lie and use fear to force their agenda into action. The only question is, will Americans fall for it? 
In the first half of the debate, Donald Trump seemed bogged down by some very distracting sniffles. After peddling for weeks a lucrative conspiracy that Hillary Clinton is too sick to be Commander-In-Chief, one must ask themselves why Trump couldnât stop sniffling. Is he sick? Was he holding back tears (after being pummeled by Clinton)? Howard Dean, former head of the DNC and presidential candidate, has a more unconventional answer: he was on drugs. Dean, who is now a contributor forÂ MSNBC, tweeted last night: Notice Trump sniffing all the time. Coke user? â Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) September 27, 2016 Trump supporters took to Twitter to express outrage, completely forgetting that their preferred candidate spent weeks fueling sexist attacks against Clinton and her stamina abilities. But hey, get offended when Dean points out what could be the obvious. After all, Trump did protect a cocaine trafficker from serving proper jail time by pulling some strings in the justice system. And considering he hasnât released any medical records, who knows what adverse effects drugs (if he does them) has done to his body and mental state. Of course Trump denied he was sniffling, even though the rancid sounds were heard by millions of watchers across the country (and the globe) and the Republican nominee denies that he is sick. So that begs the question: what else could it be. Deanâs assertion is just that â an assertion. It has no factual ground to stand on, but it is ironic to see how Trump supporters react when a conspiracy is made againstÂ candidate. Perhaps they (and Trump) will think long and hard before trying to paint Clinton as anything sheâs not. If this debate showed one thing, itâs that Hillary came out on top and Trump is not happy about it. Why not have a little fun at his petulant behavior? Howard Dean is. 
From the Daily Caller News Foundation: Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company. “This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty. “When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA’s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,” said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company. The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, “alleged due to the company’s diluted drugs, it ‘subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,’” according to the report. “The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF. The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first term. The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs. ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.” “Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF. Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company’s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients. “These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,” he said. Ranbaxy’s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report. The FDA sent a public “warning letter” to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company’s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, “show much lower potencies in these batches.” Although Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company’s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad. Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives. Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy. Thakur said he’s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “access” to patients. The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. “I have tried to reach out to them,” he told TheDCNF. “But I haven’t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.” CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations. Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was “deeply suspect.” “In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘CHAI’ was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,” Ortel told TheDCNF. The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order. He signed an executive order that, “relaxed intellectual property policy standards,” promising the U.S. government “would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘Sub-Saharan country’ relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,” the report states. CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers:  Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa. CHAI’s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief — a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush. The flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton’s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become “good acquisition targets,” according to the study. Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs. The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,” the report states. The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions. One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001. Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial. Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval. Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the “false hopes” offered by the Clinton Foundation. “You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it’s disturbing and very sad,” she said.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump held a “town hall style” meeting in Cleveland Heights with the alleged goal of discussing “African-American concerns,” strangely hosted by Sean Hannity via Fox News. The only problem: Hardly any African-Americans attended. Former Digital Director and Deputy Director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Brandon English noted on social media today the noticeably white audience attending Trump’s event. In fact, there seemed to be more African Americans on stage behind Hannity than in the audience. Trump's "African-American" town hall on Hannity pic.twitter.com/MINAQ9rbXY — Brandon English (@brandonenglish) September 21, 2016  English also revealed literature being passed around which contained the apparently frightening information that Council on American Islamic Relations has pledged to turn out an additional one million votes from Muslim Americans this year. The literature said “When Christians don’t vote we lose our voice,” implying that the election’s results will decide “Whether or not Religious Liberty is protected.” As English noted, 42% Cleveland Heights is black, and yet well over 95% of the town hall’s attendees appeared to be white. This lends credence to the polls which predict a dismal African-American turnout for Trump, despite his claims to the contrary. FYI Cleveland Heights is 42% Black pic.twitter.com/z3Xe6eAYvz — Brandon English (@brandonenglish) September 21, 2016  Trump didn’t focus on courting African American votes until late in his campaign, an outreach initiative that seems to be yielding little results. The central pitch to black Americans has repeatedly been “What do you have to lose?” If attendance at these events is any indication, perhaps they feel that a Trump vote could stand to lose them quite a bit.        
According to Barack Obama, what is necessary for countries to defeat terrorism is not a steadfast resolve to decimate these savages with sophisticated military operations. It is not a steadfast resolve to bring the fight to radical Islam. Nope, according to Barack Obama, the answer for countering terrorism rests in submitting to a one-world style of government and a willingness to “limit freedom.”   Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, Obama told world leaders that our only hope is to rely upon collaborative bodies of government like the UN and relinquishing our freedoms – our “freedom of action” as he put it. Obama also stated that “powerful nations” like the U.S. will have to limit their freedom in order to submissively submit to the will of the international body – a belief for which Obama acknowledges he has been criticized. “We have to put our money where our mouths are. And we can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations like my own accept constraints. Sometimes I’m criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions, but I’m convinced in the long run giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests but binding ourselves to international rules, over the long-term, enhances our security.” The UN was a noble experiment, but one that has long been proven to be a failed one. The practical purpose of the UN is nothing more than serving as an agency for redistribution of wealth and power amongst nations. In this body, the U.S. and other powerful nations do the heavy lifting and are only rewarded with limitations, cynicism and collectivist-inspired resentment from other nations. Since America elected a president who prioritizes the needs of other nations over the needs of the one he has sworn to serve, we have fared poorly on the global stage and it is hardly surprising to see that our outgoing coward has remained true to his vision of one-world governance and limitations of freedom throughout the world. Remember when America had presidents that believed in America so much that they stressed that the rest of the world should try to strive for our kind of ideals instead of the other way around?   
Jim Carrey might just be saying goodbye to his acting career, this is so crazy. Jim Carrey is one of the most well-known actors across the world. He is mostly known for his role in comedy films such as “Ace Ventura” and “Dumb and Dumber.” Unfortunately, the actor is in some trouble and it might just be the end for him.  Jim Carrey was hit with hard news last September when he found out that his 28-year-old girlfriend Cathriona White committed suicide. Apparently she had left a suicide note to Jim before overdosing. After finding out about her death he immediately released a comment sharing how shocked and heartbroken he was. “I am shocked and deeply saddened by the passing of my sweet Cathriona. She was a truly kind and delicate Irish flower, too sensitive for this soil, to whom loving and being loved was all that sparkled. My heart goes out to her family and friends and to everyone who loved and cared about her. We have all been hit with a lightning bolt.”  When the police showed up to investigate the crime scene they found 3 different prescriptions on White’s nightstand. Ambien (sleep aid), Percocet (painkiller), and Propranolol (blood pressure/heart). TMZ reported that all of the medications were prescribed by the same doctor but they were under the name Arthur King, which was Jim Carrey’s alias. This wasn’t Cathriona’s first time trying to kill herself. IT was reported that she attempted an overdose in 2012 after her father passed away. Now Carrey is being ACCUSED of supplying his ex with the pills that took her life. The lawsuit claims that Carrey gave the pills to Cathriona just 3 or 4 days before her death. It also states that Jim tried to cover up the fact that he gave her the pills by texting her asking her if she had taken them from his house. Not only that, but apparently she was already taking painkillers weeks before her death.  Of course, Carrey knew that she has struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts so it is crazy to think that he would actually give her the pills knowing her mental state. It was understood that the couple had broken up not long before Cathriona committed suicide and she even said that she couldn’t go on without him in her suicide note. “I’ve spent 3 days now in disbelief that you’re not here. I can go on brokenhearted and try to put the pieces back. I could, I just don’t have the will this time….I’m sorry you felt I wasn’t there for you. I tried to give you my best part. I don’t really know about burial or that sort of thing. You are my family so whatever you choose will be fine…Please forgive me. I’m just not for this world.”  This is so wild!
Hillary and the compliant media are doing everything they can to derail Trump’s surge in the polls and keep Hillary propped up (literally). There seems to be some movement among blacks toward Trump. A five or ten percent shift in the black vote toward Trump would be significant. When things begin to go south for Democrats, they play the race card. Claiming that President Obama might not have been born in the United States is a “race card” issue. Trump raised it in 2011. This forced Hawaiian authorities to release a copy of Obama’s birth certificate, although it was not a copy of the original. It’s obvious from the historical record that Trump did not originate the birther issue. It was floating around before he took up the quest for the truth. From what we know, and the media are not reporting, the birther subject was spawned in the bowels of the Clinton campaign. Did Hillary personally promote it? Probably not. It was done by surrogates so she could claim plausible deniability. “Who me?” She had and has her “buffers” like all crime families do. The following scene is from the Godfather II Senate hearing:  Here is some of what we know: “[Ben Smith and Byron Tau] detailed in a lengthy four-page-long investigation how in April 2008, when Clinton was slipping in her battle against Obama for the Democratic nomination for the presidency, ‘Clinton supporters’—as they say—circulated an anonymous email chain that pushed the theory. “‘Barack Obama’s mother was living in Kenya with his Arab-African father late in her pregnancy. She was not allowed to travel by plane then, so Barack Obama was born there and his mother then took him to Hawaii to register his birth,’ the email that Clinton supporters circulated read.” “Those anonymous people were hardly the only ones. In fact, as Joshua Green reported in The Atlantic in August 2008, a March 19, 2007 strategy memo from longtime Clinton adviser Mark Penn proves that the Clinton campaign itself was pushing the conspiracy theory. Penn, in the memo, advocated that Clinton target Obama’s ‘lack of American roots.’” (Breitbart) Read more: “Hillary Clinton and the True History of Obama ‘Birtherism.’” I suggest that you read the entire Breitbart article to see how Hillary’s 2008 presidential campaign was knee-deep in the suggestion that Obama was not born in the United States and his “lack of American roots.”[1] But the birther issue goes back further – to 1991. Joseph Farah of WND asks, “Who Was the First ‘Birther’?” “Trump was hardly the first ‘birther.’ Neither was I. Nor was my colleague Jerome Corsi. And neither was Hillary Clinton. “That honor belongs to one person and one person alone – Barack Obama.” How is this possible? “Obama went to extreme lengths to conceal his past. And, indeed, if he was born in the U.S. and was eligible to serve as president, he certainly did his best to create the mystery that led to the question being asked. “Years earlier, he billed himself as having been born in Kenya. “Maybe he thought it was a sexy way to sell books, get a foreign student scholarship, attract women – who knows? “But it’s a fact that he boasted about it.” (WND) The evidence? It comes from a short bio that was “used by Barack Obama’s literary agency beginning in 1991 and ending in 2007 – the year he declared his candidacy for president.” Here’s the first sentence of the opening paragraph (Breitbart): “Barack Obama, the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review, was born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.”  Even Snopes says it’s true. The editor of the short biography states that it “was a simple mistake and nothing more” to say that Obama was born in Kenya.  I’ll take him at his word. I can’t take him at his word given what the two images below show. It remains a fact that there was a biography from a “client list Acton & Dystel published in 1991” that states that Obama was born in Kenya that remained unquestioned until 2007. Obama himself had 16 years to disavow the information and call for a correction. It would have been unusual for a literary agency not to send a copy of the bio to Obama for his approval. Are we to believe that in 16 years in never saw the bio? In addition, there is ample evidence that people inside the Clinton campaign gave credence to the Kenyan birther issue for political reasons in order to sabotage Obama’s campaign. The media will continue to claim that Hillary Clinton had nothing to do with the birther issue because a lie is better than a Trump presidency. UPDATE: The following images were posted on my Facebook page. In this first image, in June 1998, Jane Dystel Literary Management company was still reporting that Obama was born in Kenya  As recent as 2007, Dystel & Goderich Literary Management continued the narrative that Obama was born in Kenya:                     _____________________________ [1] “NOTE FROM SENIOR MANAGEMENT [at Breitbart]: Andrew Breitbart was never a ‘Birther,’ and Breitbart News is a site that has never advocated the narrative of ‘Birtherism.’ In fact, Andrew believed, as we do, that President Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, on August 4, 1961.” Reposted With Permission From Constitution.com  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.
On Friday, I reported that of those arrested in Charlotte, North Carolina, 70% of the provocateurs and rioters were from out of state. However, one writer is now questioning why they are not facing federal charges of crossing state lines in order to engage in rioting and destruction. James Lonstreet writes at The American Thinker that the Department of Justice has a “disinterest for certain laws” and it has engaged in “non-enforcement of the law has become sport in the past eight years.” Lonstreet says that the number of out of state rioters who have been arrested should pique the interest of the DOJ, but it doesn’t. Instead, the Justice Department has become so corrupt that it no longer seeks justice. He writes: Criminals disguised as protestors cross state lines to engage in destruction and rioting.  Has anyone heard of the statute that prohibits crossing state lines to engage in such behavior being enforced by federal authorities? From the Federal Judicial Center, 2101. Riots: (a) (1) Whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce or uses any facility of interstate or foreign commerce or uses any facility of interstate or foreign commerce, including, but not limited to, the mail, telegraph, telephone, radio, or television, with intent – (A) to incite a riot; or (B) to organize, promote, encourage, participate in, or carry on a riot; or (C) to commit any act of violence in furtherance of a riot; or (D) to aid or abet any person in inciting or participating in or carrying on a riot or committing any act of violence in furtherance of a riot; and who either during the course of any such travel or use or thereafter performs or attempts to perform any other overt act for any purpose specified in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D) of this paragraph shall be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. (b) In any prosecution under this section, proof that a defendant engaged or attempted to engage in one or more of the overt acts described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D) of paragraph (1) of subsection (a) and (1) has traveled in interstate or foreign commerce, or (2) has use of or used any facility of interstate or foreign commerce, including but not limited to, mail, telegraph, telephone, radio, or television, to communicate with or broadcast to any person or group of persons prior to such overt acts, such travel or use shall be admissible proof to establish that such defendant traveled in or used such facility of interstate or foreign commerce. There is a wisdom to such laws, one that predicts how local situations can blossom into much larger events when interlopers are allowed to exacerbate the situation.  These laws need to be enforced.  They are not.  It is fair to ask, “Why not?” Recall in Ferguson that the influx of non-residents (Revolution Club of Chicago, New Black Panthers, etc.) who came to join in the fray was noted by local authorities, yet there was no action from federal authorities regarding the enforcement of statues prohibiting the crossing of state lines to engage in such behavior. Whoever incites, sets on foot, assists, or engages in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof, or gives aid or comfort thereto, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States. (June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 808; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(L), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)” source He then concludes, “There are two clarities. The administration has sympathies in one direction, and the Department of Justice has disinterest in another direction.” This is not the first time that Lonstreet has brought this issue up. In 2014, he wrote on the issue when it was the New Black Panthers stirring up rioting in Ferguson, Missouri. At that time, he cited the same law and wrote, “The proof is for all to see. The New Black Panthers once again are not prosecuted at the choice of federal authorities. (Recall Philadelphia polling incident.) Need we mention who those authorities are?” Picking and choosing which laws to enforce is problematic for sure. This administration not only often targets innocent Americans, but then allows the lawless to escape punishment. Perhaps it’s time the people brought justice upon their criminal representatives in DC and institute new government, as the Declaration of Independence advises us to do.

As we know, the final United Nations General Assembly of President Obama’s presidency is occurring in New York City this week. That gave diplomats from around the world to weigh in on this year’s very strange presidential election. Many seem rather rattled about the idea of a Donald Trump presidency, while others merely poked fun at Trump’s buffoonery. One diplomat mocked Trump, saying, “he’s a clown.” Another said, “He’s nuts.” Yet another said that Trump is an “untrustworthy egomaniacal equivocator.” Well, it’s too bad so many American citizens can’t see these traits in Trump. An Ipsos poll that polled foreign ambassadors who are currently working in America has 60 percent of these people saying they would vote for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton if they were citizens, while only 7 percent would hop on the Trump Train. That in and of itself is very telling. Dennis Jett, who spent much of his career being a diplomat himself and now works for Pennsylvania State University School of International Affairs, says that Trump’s behavior has “made many diplomats nervous and worried about American leadership, America’s role in the world.” Also curious is the fact that the American people have succumbed to the belief that Hillary is untrustworthy, while 93 percent of those surveyed in the Ipsos poll say that they find Hillary to be “somewhat” or “very much” in the realm of someone who they feel they can trust. On the other hand, just two in five of those surveyed say that they trust Trump “a little” while the rest said they don’t trust him as far as they can throw him. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier says that Trump is a “hate preacher” and alluded to the idea that the billionaire tycoon reminds him of demagogues from past times in his own homeland. French President François Hollande says that the GOP nominee’s “excesses make you want to retch.” One lobbyist familiar with the diplomatic community says that there are deepening fears around the world regarding the idea of Trump making it to the White House. Speaking anonymously, the lobbyist said: “Foreign clients are very concerned about what they perceive as a tipping point in this election. This is less about Democrat versus Republican, and more about open versus closed economy, vis-à-vis the rest of the world. With a wave of nationalism and protectionism sweeping the West, there is a real concern it will take hold in the United States and in what form it might show itself post-election. Whether it’s immigration reform or trade policy, it feels as if much of the world is opening while the U.S. is teetering on closing.” Even more alarming, the diplomats say, is Trump’s “America First” and isolationist demagoguery. Stephen Walt, who works as a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, says of the situation among diplomats: “First and most obviously, most foreign governments would like a relatively predictable post-November situation, and I think they regard Trump correctly as a giant leap in the dark. Whatever Hillary Clinton’s strengths or weaknesses might be, she has been a very conventional politician, at least when it comes to foreign policy. Therefore, people don’t anticipate any kind of radical turn if she’s elected.” Of course, another source of more than a little concern is Trump’s penchant for starting public feuds with longtime allies of the United States, as well as his public musings that he might not honor alliances such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) — which is the single most important military alliance that we have developed since the horrors of World War II. In other words, the entire world is afraid of Donald Trump. Why aren’t the American people able to see how dangerous this demagogue is? Donald Trump could single-handedly destroy the world with the power of the presidency. 
We still can’t believe this devastating news!!! As of Sunday evening, we have lost one of the most legendary men in our nation. Arnold Palmer has passed away at the age of 87 years old. Many people were shocked upon hearing this news. The golfing community is obviously devastated by the loss of such a legendary man. Upon hearing the news, the U.S. Golf Association released a saddening yet inspirational statement. “We are deeply saddened by the death of Arnold Palmer, golf’s greatest ambassador, at age 87,. Arnold Palmer will always be a champion, in every sense of the word. He inspired generations to love golf by sharing his competitive spirit, displaying sportsmanship, caring for golfers and golf fans, and serving as a lifelong ambassador for the sport.  Our stories of him not only fill the pages of golf’s history books and the walls of the museum, but also our own personal golf memories.  The game is indeed better because of him, and in so many ways, will never be the same.” He was known as “the King of Golf”, but was known for much more than that. Palmer received many awards in the sport as well as outside the sport.  Awards with high honors such as the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal, and more.  Every time Palmer accepted these awards, he offered some golf tips to whoever presented him with the awards…which was most of the time the President of the United States!  Anyone who came into contact with him, golfer or not, immediately encountered a good time. He knew how to relate to everyone, no matter the age, occupation or position they were in life. Palmer started out as an avid pilot who loved to play the game of golf. He attended Wake Forest College on a golf scholarship, which only grew his love for the sport even more. Palmer won his first tour during his rookie season in 1955, and the rest is history. Palmer brought a new attitude to golf. Unlike the other players, he took risks and tried things that ultimately may have made him look crazy from time to time. He wasn’t your average straight laced golfer, and that’s what made him rise to stardom as well as success in the golf world.  Palmer had a major influence on practically every golfer in the world. Upon hearing the devastating news, American golfer, Tiger Woods, expressed how impactful Palmer has been over the years. “Arnold meant everything to golf. Are you kidding me?. I mean, without his charisma, without his personality in conjunction with TV — it was just the perfect symbiotic growth. You finally had someone who had this charisma, and they’re capturing it on TV for the very first time. Everyone got hooked to the game of golf via TV because of Arnold.” Arnold will be missed by many people from many walks of life, as numerous people of high status and beyond have already started to mourn. Here's to The King who was as extraordinary on the links as he was generous to others. Thanks for the memories, Arnold. pic.twitter.com/UlyfpIBOL2 — President Obama (@POTUS) September 26, 2016  I just got the news at about 8:45 that Arnold had passed. I was shocked to hear that we lost a great friend (continued) pic.twitter.com/skehUsQgww — Jack Nicklaus (@jacknicklaus) September 26, 2016  We’re praying for the many friends and family Arnold has left behind. Long live the legend who did way more than just play the sport of golf. 
A man from Arizona spoke with reporters from the BBC and he did not hold back his opinions about a Muslims and Islam. The man was the founder of BombIslam.com who outspokenly talks about the danger of Islam in an uncensored way. He goes by the name Robert and he spends his Fridays taking videos of himself confronting Muslims in Phoenix.  He walks up to local Muslims right outside of their mosques asking them questions about their faith with the Quran in his hand. His videos are often controversial and confrontational. When he spoke to the reporters with the BBC they were horrified. Robert called out Islam and said that their prophet Muhammad was a war mongering tyrant pedophile who married female child brides. That’s not going to sit well with many people, LOL! Robert said, “What we’re doing right now is we’re going to do a little protest…me and a few of my friends that lets these Muslims know that they’re not going to get comfortable here in my state.” The BBC reporters were not impressed with his comments or actions. They called Robert’s group and website an anti Islamic hate group. That analysis is not remotely shocking at all. The BBC journalist narrated as Robert defaced the Quaran! Saying, “Robert rips out a page of the Quran… under UK law, these extreme protesters could be arrested for religious hatred. But America’s First Amendment protects Robert’s freedom of speech.” When another reporter from another outlet asked for Robert’s opinions on his interaction with the BBC reporter he went off on a tyrade. He clearly was not at all impressed with the British reporters. Seems as though the feeling was entirely mutual. Well, then no worries about hard feelings! Robert said, “I told these guys if I were a British person, I would feel it was my duty to overthrow my government. When they asked if I owned a gun, I pulled out a gun right then and there and put it on the table. We ate at a place called Raising Canes, which serves chicken tenders, but one of the British dudes was a vegetarian so he could only eat fries and coleslaw (hahaha).  I knew the entire time, their documentary was going to be biased against guys like me, but I knew what I was doing and knew more people would like my protest than dislike it. They titled it “United States of Hate: Muslims under attack” or some sh*t like that. It’s still hilarious to me every time I watch it. I couldn’t have filmed and edited it better myself. They basically made my video for me that day.”  Robert regularly updates his websites and goes on rants against the religion of Islam. Some are even video rants. While everyone certainly is on edge with the growing levels of Islamic radical terrorism his videos seem very far to the right. Labeling his videos as hate group propaganda isn’t necessarily an incorrect statement. Nobody stands outside of churches or synagogues berating people about their Christian or Jewish faith with a bible in hand to degrade and defile their faith. That is just over the top. 
The rioters in Charlotte may think they’re protesting racism and police brutality, but the only racists to be found in that city are them. The National Guard has been called in due to the rioting over a black cop killing a black man who the cops say came out of his car pointing a gun. In the past two days rioters attempted to throw a photographer in a fire last, three officers were hurt, a man was shot and is on life support, stores and the local arena were trashed. Obviously the live of the black cop doesn’t matter, as I doubt there would’ve been a riot if he was killed instead. In Charlotte, white people and journalists are fair game for attack. For some reason, Hillary Clinton has taken the sides of these rioters in attempting to pander to the Black Lives Matter crowd, which is going to backfire for her. Most black people hate BLM, she’s only going to attract a fringe minority to her side while alienating millions more. If you are in Charlotte, there is a way you can keep yourself save, however. As the Federalist Papers reported: A white man was able to drive through a crowd of angry protesters without incident – because he brandished his pistol. The unnamed driver approached a crowd of demonstrators chanting “No Justice! No Peace!” and waving signs that said “F**k the Police!” As the crowd began to surround him, he pulled out his weapon in his hand, stuck it out the door and pointed it at the ground. The atmosphere of the crowd immediately changed once that happened. Check out the awesome video below: Serves them right. It truly amazes me that these riots have time to stay out to late at night and block off roads as innocent people try to get through. Don’t these people have jobs to wake up for early in the morning? Oh, wait… of course not. 
When Donald Trump said that he wanted to ban Muslim immigration until we know what’s going on, every single Democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist. Oh how wrong they were, and still are. First off, racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin. Islam isn’t a race, it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization. This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they’ll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins. The insanity, in this issue, is clearly on the side of the Democrats. After seeing how the world is working, Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in. Democrats think the world will agree with them, and they’re flat out wrong. Well, this has got to sting:  The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values. The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers. So Australians want to preserve Australian values? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. Yet, when Trump says “America first” it’s suddenly racist. Ok, yeah, that sounds logical. Sixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters. “Floored” by the results, the pollster laments that the “basket of deplorables”, who he previously thought were just a “marginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan Australia”, is too big to ignore. He writes: “This not a ‘basket of deplorables’ who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. “Yes, they are more likely to vote Coalition or ‘other’ but 40% of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too. Look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with Hanson.” Do you hear that, Hillary? This is how you respond to people who oppose you. You don’t call them “deplorables,” you recognize that half the country is against you. Let’s get this done in November. (Source: Breitbart) 
Social Security has been called the third rail of American politics: Touch it and you die. And if that is indeed the case, then Donald Trump might want to start picking out a nice casket. Bloomberg is reporting that when the GOP nominee met with Paul Ryan on May 12, he told the House Speaker that he does indeed favor cutting Social Security, but he’s afraid to say so publicly because it would doom his chances in November. Bloomberg cites an unnamed source who was in the room when the meeting was held. According to the source, Trump told Ryan: “From a moral standpoint, I believe in it. But you also have to get elected. And there’s no way a Republican is going to beat a Democrat when the Republican is saying, ‘We’re going to cut your Social Security’ and the Democrat is saying, ‘We’re going to keep it and give you more.’ ” This is in stark contrast to what Trump has repeatedly said on the campaign trail. Trump has said time and time again that he would leave Social Security alone. Alex Lawson, executive director of Social Security Works, believes the real intent of Trump is the same as that of most Republicans: Drastically cutting benefits while pretending to support the program: “It is really clear: Donald Trump would 100 percent go along with the Republican donor class position of cutting Social Security. He openly says he will lie to the people about it because he knows that the people are against it. “In his eyes the ‘moral’ thing to do is to steal people’s hard-earned benefits and not talk about it.”   As we have seen repeatedly during the 2016 campaign, Trump lies about everything, reverses his positions on issues by the hour, and often seems to be utterly lost when asked for specifics about various policy questions. The man is an idiot. He is also a danger to the very essence of American democracy. Featured Image Via Flickr available under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic License
Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban sat down with 88 WABCâs Bernie and Sid on WednesdayÂ and questioned whether Donald Trump was even a billionaire. Talk about hitting the Donald where it hurts the mostâ¦. And â Cuban is even âwilling to betâ he knows how much cash Trump has on hand, while stating heâs a lot wealthier than him: âItâs not even close, I do,â Cuban said. âBefore all the Trumpians jump on me on who has more money, the reason I know is when you file your federal election campaign reports, you have to list all your cash and liquid securities and bonds. You have to list them one by one. So we know without any question that as of May 27, Donald doesnât have more than $165 million in cash and securities and bonds.â âAnd trust me, Iâve got a lot of more than that in cash, securities, and bonds,â he continued. âAnd so you know, Iâm willing to bet dimes against dollars that thatâs pretty much what heâs got.â  Cuban then went on to say he thinks Trump is acting like a âdesperateâ man trying to make money by putting his name on anything and everything. âI asked, âwhat the hell are you doing?â Are you that desperate for money?â Seriously. So when youâre putting your name on steaks, and youâre putting your name on water, youâre putting your name on playing cards, youâre putting your name on all this nonsense, right? Youâre not gonna make big bucks, no matter what. Itâs not like Trump Steaks were gonna make him $100 million. Itâs not like it was gonna make him $5 million.â Cuban does have a point. If Trump is really that successful at real estate, why then does he find himself needing to do all these other little things, half of which have gone bankrupt? Featured Image via Getty Images. Â 
Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah’s Muslim convert CIA Director John Brennan has admitted to giving his support to the Communist Party in the 1976 election. Last week, during the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s annual conference, Brennan admitted that he was asked if he had “ever worked with or for a group that was dedicated to overthrowing the US” during his first polygraph test to enter the Central Intelligence Agency. “I froze,” Brennan said. “This was back in 1980, and I thought back to a previous election where I voted, and I voted for the Communist Party candidate.” Claiming that he believed the Constitution protected free speech, he said he decided to answer truthfully. “We’ve all had indiscretions in our past,” he said. “I would not be up here if that was disqualifying.” “I froze, because I was getting so close to coming into CIA and said, ‘OK, here’s the choice, John. You can deny that, and the machine is probably going to go, you know, wacko, or I can acknowledge it and see what happens,'” Brennan said. The question Brennan was asked came from the 1940 Smith Act, which “prohibit[ed] certain subversive activities,” among those were overthrow of the US Government by force or violence. Thus the question that is routinely asked is, “Have you EVER advocated (either directly or indirectly) the overthrow of any government by force or violence?” “I said I was neither Democratic nor Republican, but it was my way, as I was going to college, of signaling my unhappiness with the system, and the need for change,” Bennan added. “I said I’m not a member of the Communist Party, so the polygrapher looked at me and said, ‘OK,’ and when I was finished with the polygraph and I left and said, ‘Well, I’m screwed.'” Brennan then attempted to put the people to sleep regarding their freedoms by stating, “So if back in 1980, John Brennan was allowed to say, ‘I voted for the Communist Party with Gus Hall’ … and still got through, rest assured that your rights and your expressions and your freedom of speech as Americans is something that’s not going to be disqualifying of you as you pursue a career in government.” It’s interesting that Mr. Brennan would make such a statement considering the CIA suspended an employee who refused to sign a non-disclosure agreement on Benghazi, wanted to allow Benghazi survivors to talk to Congress, but kept it classified, is known as a bully, and has continued to help aid America’s enemies in the Middle East. We could even point to the fact that man would not even be sworn in on a Bible, but rather a copy of the Constitution without the Bill of Rights and that was only after he had the largest number of votes against his confirmation in our history. Between 1950 and 1957, many Communist Party members were indicted and convicted for advocating Communism. According to Wikipedia: After a ten-month trial at the Foley Square Courthouse in Manhattan, eleven leaders of the Communist Party were convicted under the Smith Act in 1949.[50] Ten defendants received sentences of five years and $10,000 fines. An eleventh defendant, Robert G. Thompson, a distinguished hero of the Second World War, was sentenced to three years in consideration of his military record. The five defense attorneys were cited for contempt of court and given prison sentences. Those convicted appealed the verdicts, and the Supreme Court upheld their convictions in 1951 in Dennis v. United States in a 6-2 decision. Following that decision, the DOJ prosecuted dozens of cases. In total, by May 1956, another 131 communists were indicted, of whom 98 were convicted, nine acquitted, while juries brought no verdict in the other cases.[51] Other party leaders indicted included Claudia Jones and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, a founding member of the ACLU. However, June 17, 1957, Yates v. United States held unconstitutional the convictions of numerous party leaders in a ruling that “distinguished between advocacy of an idea for incitement and the teaching of an idea as a concept.” However, consider that that new Cold War, which has always been going on despite what the media has presented to us, is brewing and should anyone be surprised the Brennan, Obama and other Communist/Islamist ideologists are in positions of power? And do you really think they are not out to silence your opposition to you? If you do, then you are a part of the problem.

Saturday night, an Islamic immigrant went on a stabbing spree at a Minnesota mall, injuring nine people. He was heard invoking the name of “Allah” and asking people if they were Muslim before he stabbed them. But the terrorist was brought down by an off-duty police officer, Jason Falconer, who shot him as the terrorist tried to attack him. Falconer is a former police chief of the Albany Police Department, where he still works part-time. But what the media won’t tell you is that he is much more than just a police officer. Falconer is the owner and president of Tactical Advantage, LLC, a shooting range and training facility that focuses on training and arming concealed carriers. Falconer is also a member of the United States Practical Shooters Association (USPSA) and is an NRA-certified firearms instructor.   Of course, why would the media point out that being proficient in firearms is a good thing? It doesn’t fit in with their gun control narrative. And this is someone who isn’t just a police officer using his department-issued firearm to stop a terrorist; it’s a firearms instructor who has a passion for training people and promoting concealed carry. It’s like a liberal nightmare.   More and more Americans are choosing to get concealed carry permits, despite the liberal push for more gun control. Yet Jason Falconer is a perfect example of why owning guns is so necessary. We live in a dangerous world, with religious fanatics intent on murdering as many of us as possible. Liberals would have you cower in fear with no way to defend yourself. People like Jason Falconer want to help teach you to defend yourself. Is there really any question as to which is better? 
Really? Hillary Clinton is now vowing to take on racism, and she’s starting with our Police Officers? This woman is an idiot. Words nearly fail me on this one…because it is just so ridiculous! The woman, is making all the wrong choices, and desperately trying to win votes. The so-called ‘racism’ issue does not begin with Police Officers or white people… The woman has gone certifiably … MAD. “We gotta tackle the systemic racism, this horrible shooting again, how many times do we have to see this in our country?” she said in an appearance on the Steve Harvey show. Clinton was specifically referring to the police shooting of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma, saying he had his “hands in the air” when he was killed. “This is unbearable and it needs to be intolerable,” she said. Clinton told Harvey that if the African-American community came out and voted for her, she would work to stop racial shootings by police officers. “Maybe I can by speaking directly to white people say, ‘Look this is not who we are,’” she said. “We’ve got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias. Actually Hillary…what we need to is to STOP putting divisive, selfish, wicked people into the White House as President…who creates problems so they can look like a hero when they say stupid crap like this. She wants this chaos, Obama wants this chaos. It’s breeding grounds for ‘stupid’ and they want the American people… stupid, so they can continue running the place however they please.
Why in the hell do we still support Saudi Arabia? We don’t need their oil… we would make do. The majority of the 9/11 terrorists came from Saudi Arabia, as does the Bin Laden family. The Saudi deputy crown prince told reporters in June the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has funded 20% of Hillary Clinton’s campaign. She’s taking money from a stone cold enemy and that’s not the only one by any means. You do not consort or take money from those who intend to destroy your country… period. That goes for Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. It also includes any dictatorship or communist strongman. We never learn our lesson, do we? Now it comes to light that Saudi Arabia is selling ISIS sex slaves off to the highest bidder at public auctions. Iraqis, Syrians, Saudis and WESTERNERS all bought slaves at the auction. This is monstrous and going on right out in the open. It should be stopped cold… whatever it takes. Britain needs to stop selling the Saudis weapons and we need to pull our politicians out of the Saudi bedroom and back home. They are killing us and enslaving women and children. How can we silently stand by while this evil goes on?  From Jihad Watch: It isn’t news that the Islamic State has long been abusing and trafficking sex slaves – especially Yazidi girls – but it has been now discovered that the sex slaves of IS are being “sold in horrifying auctions to UK ally Saudi Arabia.” An eyewitness reported: Dozens of women were being held in a large room, and it was not only Iraqis and Syrians trading women but also Saudis and Westerners, whose actual nationality was not clear. Western women have also been reported to be among the victims in keeping with the Islamic State’s practice of enslaving kafir women: The Islamic State’s human trafficking operation includes enslaving women who they consider to be ‘kafir’, non-Muslim people like Yazidis and Christians, before selling them for money. The depraved thugs are also involved in the radicalisation of young women all over the world and try to tempt them to come to their caliphate with false promises of wealth, marriage and forgiveness of sin. As these women are ‘rescued’ from ISIS, they are not being given freedom. They are being sold on the auction block into a hellish existence. These are the people that Hillary Clinton takes money from, makes deals with and hobnobs with. Monsters of a feather. I have said for a long time, not only are the Saudis sponsoring ISIS, so are the Russians. We are being played. Our own president is complicit. Let’s not elect another corrupt demon who cares nothing of women and children being sold to rapists. After all, Hillary Clinton is married to one.  
David Brock is the founder of the left-wing media “watchdog” Media Matters for America. It has a stated goal of “comprehensively monitoring, analyzing, and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media.” Brock is also the head of super PAC in support of Hillary Clinton called Correct the Record. Like Media Matters, Correct the Record seeks to monitor all conservative news and coverage of Hillary Clinton and attempt to “debunk” any criticism of her. Since they’re also in the business of opposition research, they’re wanting to pay anyone to come forward with some embarrassing dirt on Donald Trump. As long as the dirt was “legally” obtained. They’re dubbing this project “TrumpLeaks.” The Washington Free Beacon reported: Brock asked for video or audio of Trump that has yet to be released. “One of the most important things for voters to evaluate in any election is the full measure of a candidate’s views, ideas, and temperament over time,” the website states. “In making a choice for president, voters must also consider how various candidates present themselves to the public and to the world. There are few things more important in that regard than access to video or audio in the form of prior television or radio interviews or more candid video from events a candidate may have attended.” Brock’s super PAC goes on to say they can offer compensation to anyone who has new video or audio that has been obtained legally. “TrumpLeaks is an effort to uncover unreported video or audio of Donald Trump so voters can have access to the Donald Trump who existed before running for president and before his recent affinity for teleprompters,” the website says of the project. “TrumpLeaks can provide some compensation to those who have usable, undoctored video or audio that has been legally obtained or is legally accessible.” NBC News noted that the project is “highly unusual” and seems to “cross a new line” in modern day politics. I think the only way in which this is “crossing a new line” is that they’re so out in the open about it. This is how they get dirt on opponents. It’s just that a candidate’s super PAC doesn’t usually make a public announcement about it. There’s got to be something out there that someone knows that will be damaging to Donald Trump. Everyone’s got skeletons in their closet. I imagine that “TrumpLeaks” will get a hold of it and wait until the most opportune time to release it. If for nothing else, it does show how desperate Hillary Clinton and her surrogates are in trying to make a comeback. It shows that they’re concerned that they’re not going to win.

So when Crist describes Clinton as “honest,” the audience laughs. The sad part is none of the other adjectives fit Clinton either. He said he was proud of Clinton. He added, “She’s been a very good Secretary of State, a very good Senator from New York…” By what standards? Nowhere in the world did Clinton make a positive impact. As Senator from New York, her record is embarrassing.   
Huma Abedin dumped her then-husband Anthony Weiner when it was revealed that he had carried on a sexting relationship with another woman – one of many – in which he had sent a risqué picture of himself, and in the picture, he was accompanied by his young son. But unbeknownst to his then-wife and the rest of the world – but certainly not surprisingly – he was carrying on another relationship during this time with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. From January to July, he sent photos and vulgar texts to her. I’ll let the New York Post fill you in on the dirty details: The 15-year-old high school student went public with a trove of lurid come-ons she got from Weiner, who exchanged his “Carlos Danger” persona for the alias “T Dog” to send her kinky texts and shirtless selfies over a cell-phone messenger app. Weiner repeatedly told the unidentified teen how “hard” and horny he was, at one point boasting that after sex with him she would, “limp for a week,” the Daily Mail reported. Weiner — whose serial sexting cost him his seat in Congress and a comeback bid for mayor — also shared pornographic videos with her, asked her to get naked and masturbate for him over Skype, and even told her about “rape fantasies” that grossed her out. The girl said Weiner tried to cover up the sexual nature of their relationship by pressuring her to write a letter to her father and a teacher in whom she had confided, “and tell them what I said was false.” Even liberal Democrat Governor Andrew Cuomo is disgusted with Weiner. “If the reports are true, it’s possibly criminal and it is sick,” he said. “And frankly, I’ve heard enough about Anthony Weiner, and I think that goes for all New Yorkers.” If Weiner is charged at the federal level with sexual exploitation of children, it carries with it a minimum of 15 years in prison, and a maximum of 30 years. At the state level, disseminating indecent material and promoting the sexual performance of a child could each get him 7 years in jail. In response, Weiner said that he has “likely been the subject of a hoax,” but as the Post pointed out, he didn’t deny any of the allegations against him. In a prepared statement, Weiner said, “I have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement [sic] about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent. I am filled with regret and heartbroken for those I have hurt…. I have no one to blame but me for putting myself in this position. I am sorry.”  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.
A reporter for The Washington Post, David Fahrenthold, has uncovered another instance where GOP nominee Donald Trump has made some questionable tax-related choices. The investigation that Faherenthold launched into the Trump Foundation, along with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s personal finances, has unearthed the fact that Donald Trump has used his charitable foundation, which is tax-exempt, as a tool to evade $2.3 million dollars of personal income taxes. How? By having business associates that owe him money to put it into his foundation instead. An excellent example is that the Trump Foundation took in payments “totaling nearly $1.9 million from a man in New York City who sells sought-after tickets and one-of-a-kind experiences to wealthy clients.” According to sources in the Trump organization who wish to remain anonymous the man is Richard Ebers, and he was told that instead of paying the former reality TV star for services, he should pay the Trump Foundation instead. It makes sense really, when you consider the fact that despite the reality that Donald Trump hasn’t even bothered donating to his own foundation since 2008 the “donations” continue to pour in. One of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s senior advisers, Boris Epshteyn, actually tried to explain it away by saying: ‘What Trump did was provide a service, renounce any fees, and then merely “suggest” that the other party make a donation to a charity of their choosing.’ The irony is not lost on anyone that he’s basically saying it’s legal, and it is, despite the fact that anyone with half a mind deduce the shady implications. Marc Owens, Head of the Internal Revenue Service’s non-profit watchdog agency, hasn’t been very thorough in his monitoring of the Trump foundation and seems shocked by all of the information that Fahrenthold’s investigation has managed to uncover. Owens, said: ‘This is so bizarre, this laundry list of issues. It’s the first time I’ve ever seen this, and I’ve been doing this for 25 years in the IRS, and 40 years total.’ It’s pretty obvious to anyone that’s paying attention that the GOP nominee is probably violating the rules that were written to prevent this kind of blatant laundering of money when it comes to tax-exempt foundations. If Donald Trump were to be charged and found guilty of violating these laws the punishment would mean a monetary penalty, losing the tax-exempt status for his foundation, and even, perhaps, criminal charges being filed. When asked by journalist Sharyl Attkisson: ‘Are you confident that the Trump Foundation has followed all charitable rules and laws?’ Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump responded: ‘Well, I hope so… I mean, my lawyers do it.’ It’s kind of ironic that the Trump campaign would go after the Clinton Foundation when Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s own Trump Foundation has such shady things going on. For shady example, his foundation has zero paid staff. The Trump Foundation has literally been laundering money under the guise of being a “charity” and the person profiting from it all is none-other-than Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.

On Monday, Donald Trump gave a speech in Estero, Florida that focused on the latest terrorist attacks in New York, New Jersey and Minnesota. He used it to give a blistering indictment of President Obama and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton for their feckless handling of the Middle East and Islamic terrorism in general-which they are unable or unwilling to even name. As usual, the Clinton-Obama conglomeration (for lack of a better word) came out with their typically vanilla response to the above terrorist attacks. White House spokesman Josh Earnest came out with yet another boffo explanation that we are in a “war of narratives with ISIS.” Clinton stated on Sunday that it would be wise not to speak out before all the facts were in (I am paraphrasing), and that we needed to “steel our resolve” whatever that means. Then on Monday she stated that  Trump’s rhetoric was giving aid and comfort to the enemy, a form of treason, no less. “Donald Trump is being used as a recruiting sergeant for ISIS,” Clinton said on Monday morning. “The kind of language and rhetoric Trump has used is giving aid and comfort to our adversaries.”  Yes, Hillary. All these atrocities are happening because of Trump’s rhetoric. There is no doubt that Trump is going to at least give us a feel for how he is going to battle Islamic terror. He already has given us some in his references to limiting Muslim immigration. Now that he has “modified” it by talking about “extreme vetting,” Clinton has jumped on the bandwagon saying that she has always supported enhanced vetting – this as she actively supports a dramatic increase in Syrian refugees – over five times as many as Obama’s 10,000. Trump, for his part, while not telegraphing our moves to the enemy, needs to let us know something about his military intentions. My sense is that he will try to bring NATO and our Arab allies together into a fighting force that will go into Syria, Iraq and Libya to destroy the ISIS army in the air and on the ground. That done, it is up to the West to take whatever steps we can to keep ISIS terrorists out of our lands. It goes without saying that our immigration policies must be drastically revised. (In Europe, it may be too late.) I truly think that the majority of the American people – while not wanting to massively violate the rights of American Muslims – are not happy with our government’s responses to Islamic terror, even more so as we are attacked on our own soil. Hillary Clinton plainly promises more of the same if elected. They know that Islamic terrorists are at war with us and intend to carry out that war on our own streets. While not painting all Muslims with the same brush, it is clear to all that terrorists are walking among us. We know that future attacks are being planned as we speak. By various estimates, the current Muslim population in the US is around 1%. That amounts to a few million people, who are immigrants, naturalized American citizens, or younger people actually born here. Forget about mass roundups, deportations or internments. We can adopt a zero-tolerance policy for non-citizens who violate our laws and kick them out, but by and large, it will be up to law enforcement and the courts to remove the terrorists and plotters from our midst. In the meantime, that 1%  must not be allowed to grow. If we are having these problems at 1%, what do you think it will be like at 5% or 10% or higher? Far beyond a religion, this is a political ideology that is incompatible with our constitution – a belief system, if you will. We once kept communists from entering the US based on their belief system, which would have subverted our democracy.  We need to find a way to do it again – if for no other reason than to protect our citizens from harm. Trump wants to find a way to accomplish that. If Trump handles this issue sensibly, it can be a winner for him. Without castigating an entire community, all he has to do is talk about Hillary’s failures and reluctance to go beyond what she and Obama have already done (or not done) in responding to Islamic terror – which they won’t even name. However, he also has to convince us he has a concrete plan to destroy ISIS and protect the American people.

The first Presidential debate took place last night, and while it felt quite short in scope, it made up for it in Trump’s trademark quick-witted humor. I think the night should have been called “The Roast of Hillary Clinton,” because she got wrecked and her lies came back in full force to destroy any argument she had against Trump. Hillary not only started floundering, but Trump turned her into a stuttering mess, complaining that she’s being picked on, as if Trump was some schoolyard bully instead of a major political candidate that called her out on her countless lies. When Hillary says that she’ll be blamed for every bad thing that’s ever happened, Trump, without skipping a beat, he says “Why not?” Mic. Drop. That’s the exact moment when Hillary knew that her days of politicking were over. See for yourself:  This was perhaps the most satisfying series of clips I’ve seen this week. I cannot stop watching and cheering. Share this everywhere. (Source: YouTube) 
Thereâs not much to say here. GIPHY killed it with this one: Â  When someone goes on a rant but you have receipts. https://t.co/axe58zCeJL #debatenight #Debates2016 pic.twitter.com/KTgdWAvaAb â GIPHY (@giphy) September 27, 2016  Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
A border wall isn’t just to keep out illegal immigrants – it acts as a national security measure. China didn’t build their great wall to keep out immigrants, they built it to keep out foreign invaders. We need a border for that reason too, in addition to solving the problem of illegal immigration. The entire nation of Mexico is essentially run by drug cartels, and they’ve racked up a death toll that would make ISIS envious. Additionally, if ISIS is going to enter America, our unsecured Southern Border is their best bet.  And for that reason, you can bet they already are trying… As the Conservative Tribune reported: Eight Syrian nationals attempted to illegally enter the United States from Mexico on Monday, raising new concerns about security inside the United States in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. Breitbart cited two unnamed federal agents who said the Syrians were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas. While Border Patrol has yet to confirm this report, National Border Patrol Council Local 2455 President Hector Garza did confirm that he was also receiving similar reports from multiple agents. “Border Patrol agents who we represent have been contacting our organization to voice concerns about reports from other agents that Syrians crossed the U.S. border from Mexico in the Laredo Sector,” he said. “Our agents have heard about Syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents. At this time, I cannot confirm or deny that Syrians have crossed, for security reasons.” It would be a lot easier to catch these terrorists if the Obama administration let border patrol do their jobs. Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza, acting in his role as president of the National Border Patrol Council, Local 2455 said on Fox News earlier this month that  “Eight out of ten people that are caught entering our country illegally are not deported and are allowed to stay in the United States,” Garza explained. “Unfortunately for Border Patrol agents, we are trying to do our jobs as best we can with the very limited resources that we have.” We need a border and stronger border security – and there’s only one Presidential candidate willing to help with both. 
The archconservative Arizona Republic newspaper in Phoenix has endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, less than 24 hours after the conclusion of the first presidential debate. If there were questions this summer that Arizona has become a swing state, this surprising answer puts a must win state for Republicans – which has been solidly red since becoming a state – into play for Democrats in 2016. Arizona’s largest media outlet has never picked a Democrat for President since 1890. Not only did the Republic endorse Clinton because Trump is unfit for office, but their 1400 word endorsement is lengthy, absolutely comprehensive, filled with videos and even rejects the Republican embrace of racist immigration politics for the Democratic Party’s inclusive recipes to move America forward: The Arizona Republic endorses Hillary Clinton for president. America needs to look ahead and build a new era of prosperity for the working class. This is Hillary Clinton’s opportunity. She can reach out to those who feel left behind. She can make it clear that America sees them and will address their concerns. She can move us beyond rancor and incivility. As secretary of state, Clinton made gender equality a priority for U.S. foreign policy. This is an extension of Clinton’s bold “women’s rights are human rights” speech in 1995. It reflects an understanding that America’s commitment to human rights is a critically needed beacon in today’s troubled world. Clinton retains her composure under pressure. She’s tough. She doesn’t back down. Trump responds to criticism with the petulance of verbal spit wads. That’s beneath our national dignity. When the president of the United States speaks, the world expects substance. Not a blistering tweet. In fact, the Arizona Republic published such a lengthy editorial board statement that it’s easier to summarize their section headers, because these eight points made by the conservative newspaper answer many of the media’s lingering questions about both candidates. The Republic reserved its harshest criticism for Trump’s misadventure to Mexico City, then paired with an immigration speech in Phoenix. The Republican’s gamble failed, and the trip to our southern neighbor mushroomed into an international incident, spurring legislation which will prevent Mexico from ever paying for a border wall. Even worse for Trump, the Arizona Republic’s unequivocal slam dunk of his mindless harsh immigration policies is a massive failure in the border state whose notorious Sheriff Joe Arpaio is the most racist lawman in America. Phoenix has voted the racist birther – who refuses to give up the witch hunt of President Obama like Trump claimed he would – into office since 1993, and it’s a place who prefers the most extreme solutions to immigration and loves racial profiling in law enforcement. The Republic roundly condemned Republican tropes demonizing Latinos in general and Mexicans in particular: Contrast Clinton’s tenacity and professionalism with Trump, who began his campaign with gross generalities about Mexico and Mexicans as criminals and rapists. These were careless slaps at a valued trading partner and Arizona’s neighbor. They were thoughtless insults about people whose labor and energy enrich our country. Trump demonstrated his clumsiness on the world stage by making nice with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto only a few hours before appearing in Phoenix to deliver yet another rant about Mexican immigrants and border walls. What’s more, Arizona went down the hardline immigration road Trump travels. It led our state to SB 1070, the 2010 “show me your papers” law that earned Arizona international condemnation and did nothing to resolve real problems with undocumented immigration. Arizona understands that we don’t need a repeat of that divisive, unproductive fiasco on the national level. A recent poll shows Arizonans oppose both more walls and the mass deportations Trump endorses. We need a president who can broker solutions. There’s just a certain segment of American voters who will never ever change their minds based on facts, and so they’ll continue to vote Trump. But independent and undecided voters can trust the numerous factual reasons issued from sources like the Arizona Republic, who have no incentive to be nice to Hillary Clinton or institutional preference for Democrats. If Hillary Clinton can win over so many Republicans with her leadership qualities and competent preparation for the job of President, the choice to vote for the Democratic nominee for America’s independent voters should be clear this November.
If Republicans and Donald Trump really care about our military veterans, they will tell this douchebag to shut the hell up. Ohio GOP Rep. Warren Davidson has outraged the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the House Veterans Affairs Committee by referring to veterans as “moochers” who are just pretending to be hurt or sick when they show up to get medical care from the VA. “Just like workers comp out here’s got moochers, I wish that there were no vets that were the same sort of problem on our society,” Davidson said during a town hall event on Monday. “But part of the problem is there are some vets that are moochers and they’re clogging up the system, and we do as taxpayers want to make sure the VA filters out these folks that are pretenders. Just like we wish there were no people out there with stolen valor, but that’s a problem in the vet community, too.” Davidson, who won a special election to replace John Boehner and is a supporter of Donald Trump, has drawn a shitstorm of criticism ever since. Veterans of Foreign Wars spokesman Joe Davis slammed Davidson for insulting the men and women who have served this country. “Honorably discharged veterans with service-connected wounds, illnesses and injuries, or who are indigent due to circumstances beyond their control, are not moochers,” he said in a statement. House Veterans Affairs Committee chairman Jeff Miller said he hopes that Davidson merely “misspoke” and called upon him to clarify his remarks. And Davidson’s remarks are particularly outrageous because Davidson is a veteran himself. But when given the chance to back down, Davidson did the opposite. “Any effort to suggest I have anything other than a soldier’s passion for providing our veterans with the care they deserve is dishonest,” he said before his spokesman presented four case of VA fraud to somehow prove his claims that veterans are “moochers.” The problem is that these cases involve people who pretend to be veterans. In other words, the people in these cases are NOT veterans. But Davidson called veterans “moochers” anyway. It would have been so simple for Davidson to just clarify his remarks, but he didn’t because, like Donald Trump, Republicans are incapable of admitting when they are wrong. So Davidson’s insult of veterans stands in the record as a testament to how Republicans really feel about the men and women who fought for our country. 
Dolly Kyle has written a scathing “tell all” book exposing the sickening hidden truth about Bill and Hillary Clinton. Hillary’s war on just about anyone who is beneath her, or who would dare to get in the way of her ascent to the White House. When will the media do their job and report the truth about this horrible opportunist? Dolly Kyle – who was just 11 when she first crossed paths with Bill, dated him through high school and began sleeping with him once they graduated – published the claims about the Clinton couple’s racial epithets and politics in her new book, Hillary: The Other Woman, published by WND Books. She writes of one occasion, when developmentally challenged children were having difficulty picking up the eggs at a traditional Easter egg hunt on the grounds of the governor’s mansion during Bill’s tenure in the Arkansas state house. Reluctant hostess Hillary had enough. ‘The frustrated Me-First Lady demanded, “When are they going to get those f*****g ree-tards out of here?”‘ Dolly writes. When Hillary arrived in Arkansas, Dolly writes, she looked down her nose at what she viewed as ‘ignorant hillbillies’. She was raised in a middle-class suburb in Illinois and considered herself above the southerners – unless she was campaigning in New York state where she declared herself to be a lifelong Yankees fan. Hillary didn’t belong in Arkansas but here she was’.  In the governor’s mansion for eight years, Bill and Hillary were both getting tired of the routine and frustrations of the small Southern state and Bill opted out of running for reelection in 1990. He was marking his time until he could make a move for the White House. Via: Daily Mail 
In his final speech to the worthless United Nations Security Council, Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah urged that Americans give up their liberty and sovereignty and submit to world government. In stark contrast to founding father Benjamin Franklin, who uttered the famous words, “Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety,” Obama called on Americans to give up more liberty for security.  “We can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations like my own accept constraints,” Obama said. He then added that “powerful nations” like the United States must give up their autonomy to realize security. “I’m convinced in the long run giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests but binding ourselves to international rules, over the long-term, enhances our security.” Obama said. Of course, Obama was doing this to praise the United Nations, an organization that is anti-American, anti-Christian and totalitarian at its core. So, what’s the problem? Obama is convinced and that should make us just fall in line? Wasn’t he the guy that was convinced Obamacare would lower costs and provide everyone with health insurance? Did that materialize? Nope. This man has lied through his teeth the entire time he has been in office and we’ve documented that. While Obama, a clear foreigner by his words, his wife’s word’s, a Kenyan Ambassador and the record of the Kenyan Parliament (despite what Trump and others say), claims that his view is the right one, he also acknowledges that real Americans, born and bred here, oppose him. These people do so rightly. “Sometimes I’m criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions, but I’m convinced in the long run…” Obama said. “We have to put our money where our mouths are.” Yes, but the problem is America is not normal to the international community. She has been unique throughout her history. She was unique because her foundation was established upon the Bible, not upon “international norms,” which were pagan in origin. That’s what made America great. “I believe that at this moment we all face a choice,” Obama added after denouncing the building of a southern wall on the US border. “We can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration or we can retreat into a world sharply divided and ultimately in conflict along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion. I want to suggest to you today that we must go forward and not back.” While I do agree with some bit of cooperation as in working with other countries on trade and things of that nature, which George Washington acknowledged we should do, I disagree with how Obama believes that we do that. His idea is to reward bad behavior, even to encourage it and to redistribute the wealth of the united States. That is not only unconstitutional, it’s immoral and wrong and he has no authority to do such things. Yet, Congress and the people have allowed him to do it. Finally, Obama stated that the United Nations was established to replace the ravages of war with peaceful cooperation. No, it was not. The majority of countries in the United Nations are either Communists, Socialists or Islamists. There is nothing peaceful about those ideologies in the least. As a friend of mine aptly stated, “They (the founders of the UN) wanted the organization they formed to be perceived as a dove when in reality it was to be a venomous snake.” This is not the first time Obama has pushed this globalist mentality either. Remember when he addressed dignitaries and members of NATO in 2014? If not, click here to listen to that speech. Even conservatives were livid that we pointed out what he was actually saying.

Hillary Clinton was absolutely right to call Trump supporters deplorable and this is why. In response to the expulsion of a Kansas State University student who said it âfeels good to finally be a n*ggaâ in a photo of herself covered in LâOrÃ©al facial cleansing mask, Dell Rapids, South Dakota firefighter John Nygaard literally called for bringing back slavery and endorsed Republican nominee Donald Trump. âThink we should make slaves again,â Nygaard wrote. âVote Trump! Fuck these people.â Hereâs a screenshot of his comments via Raw Story.  While that probably made Trump and his white supremacist supporters smile, the people of Dell Rapids were horrified by the remarks. âYouâre a public servant and youâre putting stuff like that on Facebook, thatâs not good,â resident William Dezee told KSFY. âThereâs enough problems going on, we donât need racial slurs or people wearing masks or saying something thatâs what 160 years old, leave it alone. Thatâs the way it should be.â The outrage was enough for the Dell Rapids Fire Rescue to boot Nygaard off the squad and he has been terminated. âJohn is no longer a member of our volunteer organization,â the department said in a statement posted on Facebook. âDell Rapids fire would like to apologize on behalf of our former member for his insensitive and narrow minded comments on Facebook. This is something we take very seriously and this type of thinking will not be tolerated by our members.â Hereâs the report via KSFY.   People like Nygaard hurt the trust between the community and our first responders because you have to wonder if you are going to be helped or not depending on what color your skin is. A public service like fire rescue should work to help everyone regardless of race. But racists like Nygaard undermine that principle. Donald Trump has objected to his supporters being called deplorable. Well, if he really doesnât think a racist who supports re-enslaving black people is deplorable, he has zero chance of getting a black person to vote for him, and he certainly shouldnât get anyone elseâs vote either. 
If you tuned into the first presidential debate last night, youÂ already know that Hillary Clinton pretty much wiped the floor with Donald Trump. Trump was so nervous and unprepared that he was reduced to constant sniffling, excessive thirstiness and his usual outlandish rants and interruptions. Letâs just say that everyone noticed. Trump couldnât take the heat, and he definitely cannot handle the humiliationÂ that is following the debate. While several major media outlets are calling the debate a clear win for Clinton, Trump is trying to come up with reasons why he bombed so horribly (even though it was perfectly obvious that he would). The best excuse Trump hasÂ been able to come up with is beyond pathetic and nothing but a move of desperation. The Associated Press has reported that after the debate, the GOP nominee immediately told reporters that he was unable to perform to the best of his ability because there was something wrong with his microphone. And yet despite something being âwrong with it,â that micÂ seemed to work fine as he shouted over HillaryÂ every few seconds.Â AP reported: âTrump visited the media spin room after the Monday night debate and said, âThey gave me a defective mic!âÂ He said he âwonder(s), was that on purpose?ââ CBSâsÂ Sopan DebÂ also happened to be there and gave a little more detail into Trumpâs microphone conspiracy theory: Twitter Trump is seriously trying to claim that someone tried to sabotage the debate on purpose! What a moron. The truth is that Trump didnât prepare for the debate like Clinton did â and even if he had spent a little more time preparing than tweeting, it wouldnât have mattered much â heâs completely unqualified for the White House. Last night, HillaryÂ showed America that these two shouldnât even be up against each other. There is no comparison. HillaryÂ looked like our next President, and Trump looked like a fraud and an imposter whoÂ should have never made it up on that stage. I wouldnât be surprised if Trump comes up with more lame stories about why his performance was compromisedÂ last night. 
Hillary is without a doubt, the worst and most despicable liar to ever run for the office of President Of The United States… Hillary is a sociopathic liar: A sociopath is typically defined as someone who lies incessantly to get their way and does so with little concern for others. A sociopath is often goal-oriented (i.e., lying is focused—it is done to get one’s way). Sociopaths have little regard or respect for the rights and feelings of others.

On an Ohio motorway a semi-truck was seen driving down the road. Most motorist that passed by the truck noticed nothing unusual about the unassuming truck. However, one motorists noticed the words on the back of the truck just below the bumper. The motorist immediately took a photo and posted it online. Now many are less than thrilled to know what was quietly passing through their state. While driving down the highway in Twinsburg, Ohio one driver noticed something on back of a big rig that stood out to him. He immediately took a closer look and saw what the driver had done to his truck's mudflaps. Now Black Lives Matter supporters are furious at the trucker's message, while many other patriots across the country are cheering in support. The picture that the unidentified driver of the truck took was sent and posted to the Ohio Going Blue Facebook page. It didn't take long after the pic was posted for it to go completely viral. The man cleverly chose to through the controversial theme that the Black Lives Matter movement is built on, the idea that only 'black' lives matter. The trucker's message smacked down those entitled blm thugs with his awesome 4-word statement.  The truck's mudflaps read "Without cops, nothing matters." A very true statement indeed that some of these blm cop-haters should really try to understand. Police do more than just deal out justice to those who break laws. They are the glue that holds together the fabric of society by maintaining order and preventing chaos. Without the protection and watch of our nation's police force many innocents would be robbed of their way of living and lives themselves. It is important to take a step back and realize what these men and women in blue really do for us each and every day. This truck driver obviously gets it and knows that the Black Lives Matter is clearly working their hardest to unravel the order that police have fought so hard to protect. Make sure to share this story on Facebook let us know if you think the Black Lives Matter movement only wants to create chaos and disorder for their own personal gains.

Guess who George H.W. Bush is voting for? He lost to Bill Clinton in 1992, and his son is George W. Bush. Yet it seems that the elder Bush finds Trump so distasteful a candidate that heâs actually going to cast his vote for Hillary Clinton. According to Bush Sr. had originally planned on keeping quiet about this election. Considering the fact that heâs a Republican, and therefore expected to weigh in on the side of the Republicansâ chosen candidate, this is actually pretty major. But it wasnât Bush himself who revealed his vote. It was Kathleen Kennedy Townsendâdaughter of the late Robert Kennedyâwho let this particular interesting tidbit slip: âOn Monday, Townsend posted a picture on her Facebook page shaking hands next to the former president and this caption: âThe President told me heâs voting for Hillary!!'â She stood by that later on when talking to According to her, George H.W. Bush would rather vote for his former rival and successorâs wife than the god-awful train wreck that is Donald Trump. A spokesman for the Bush family refused to actually confirm this â he said that George H.W.âs vote is a private decision and will remain so. He himself isnât commenting, but it seems that those who are in his inner circle arenât being so tight-lipped, if Kennedy is to be believed. Bush Sr. did make it clear back in May that he had absolutely zero intention of endorsing Trump. Thatâs a bold, but wise, move for any Republican, since Republicans are supposed to be on the side of freedom and Trump is on the side of dictatorship and authoritarianism. His love of Russian president Vladimir Putin would suggest that heâs also on the side of autocracy. None of these three things meshes with the democracy Republicans say weâve built in even the smallest way. Earlier in the summer, an administration official for George W. Bush announced that she would vote for Hillary, adding her name to an ever-growing list of Republicans and conservatives who canât find it within themselves to support Trump. Jeb Bush has said he can neither vote for Hillary nor Trump. A former Republican president refusing to stand for the current Republican nominee is a stinging blow indeed. 
Tragedy has left the Miami Marlins team in devastation. Their friend, colleague and someone they probably considered family, has died in a tragic accident. Such unexpected shocking loss is not an experience to wish on anyone.  Jose Fernandez, their pitcher, was killed in a boating accident Sunday morning. It was just last week he had posted a picture on social media of his girlfriend who had an obvious ‘baby bump’ in an announcement that they were expecting their first child. In its caption, he told the world he thanked his girlfriend for coming into his life and expressed his excitement for their future together as a family. A news conference was held by his team after learning of his death and the team’s manager, Don Mattingly, was very visibly shaken during the conference, in tears over the loss of his team player and friend. “I see such a little boy,” Mattingly said. “The way he played, there was just joy with him when he played.” When the news conference was over, left fielder, Christian Yellich and the team’s second baseman, Dee Gordon, embraced and walked out somberly with other team members. A loss like this, so unexpected… was visibly painful watching them trying to get a grip on the situation. Earlier, Gordon had walked out to the mound at Marlins Park, where the grounds crew had painted a “16” — Fernandez’s number — and placed a Marlins cap. Gordon stood looking at the tribute before kneeling down in a moment of silent reflection. “Sadly, the brightest lights are often the ones that extinguish the fastest,” Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria said in a statement.  We are stunned and devastated by the tragic news that Jose Fernandez, 24, has died in a boating accident. https://t.co/QIBcnIYJ1i pic.twitter.com/SDZoL6NMEb — MLB (@MLB) September 25, 2016    I will miss you… Sorry if i never told you how valuable your friendship was too me… pic.twitter.com/HzstRZDBri — Tom Koehler (@TKREFRESH22) September 25, 2016    You loved striking me out, and teasing me about it.

Denver Broncos' linebacker Brandon Marshall lost another endorsement over his controversial protest against the national anthem. CenturyLink followed Air Academy Federal Credit Union in withdrawing support for Marshall, The Denver Post reports. The company said that while it respects his right as an American to show his dissent, his actions conflict with its values. "While we acknowledge Brandon’s right, we also believe that whatever issues we face, we also occasionally must stand together to show our allegiance to our common bond as a nation," wrote CenturyLink in a statement. "In our view, the national anthem is one of those moments. For this reason, while we wish Brandon the best this season, we are politely terminating our agreement with him.” Inspired by 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, Marshall decided to kneel during the national anthem before the NFL game as a protest against police brutality and racism, BET reports.  “I’m against social injustice. I’m not against the military, the police or America at all. I’m against social injustice,” Marshall explained. “People that aren’t minorities, they don’t know what it’s like to be a minority in this country,” he added. “And I’m not saying it’s terrible. I love this country. We have great opportunities, but at the same time, if you’re not a minority you don’t understand. I speak for everybody when I say that, because I know they agree with me." Since then, Marshall has experienced intense backlash, ranging from withdrawal of endorsements to loss of fans. One man even set an orange shirt with Marshall's name on it ablaze.  Despite the criticism, the once fan-favorite Marshall has no regrets, will kneel again during the Sept. 15 game, and says he sends love to all. "It’s cool, because people can call me the N-word or cuss or at me or say they wish I’d break my neck all they want," he said. "There’s no backlash from me. Hate can’t drive out hate. Only love can drive out hate.” Sources: The Denver Post, CenturyLink, BET / Photo credit: Ron Chenoy/USA Today Sports, The Denver Post, Eric Goodman/Twitter
Millions of people tuned in Monday night to watch coverage of the presidential debate between Hilary Clinton and Trump. Going into the debate, election polls were pretty even, but after an incredible display of stamina, Hilary Clinton came out the clear winner, as reported by almost every media organization broadcasting the debate. Following the debate, many public personalities took to Twitter to voice their opinion on the biggest political event of the last decade. But few were quite as hilarious and spot-on as former tabloid talk show host Jerry Springer of The Jerry Springer Show: Hillary Clinton belongs in the White House. Donald Trump belongs on my show. — Jerry Springer (@jerryspringer) September 27, 2016 After years of hosting his colorful daytime drama, Jerry Springer is arguably the authority on unsavory characters, the criminal underworld, and white trash. And the truth is, Jerry Springer is right. Donald Trump is nothing more than a reality TV star who belongs in the tabloids more than he does in our living rooms being considered for president of the most powerful nation in the world. Luckily, tonight it really showed. Let’s hope America makes the right choice this November.
Police were called to a New Jersey elementary school after a 9-year-old student said, "Brownies," while talking about snacks, his mother alleged. Another student reportedly misinterpreted the comment and thought it was said in a racist way, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. A teacher subsequently called police. “He said they were talking about brownies,” Stacy dos Santos, the child’s mother, said. "Who exactly did he offend?" Dos Santos added that the incident has made her think twice about sending her child back to the school in the fall. “I’m not comfortable with the administration; I don’t trust them, and neither does my child,” she said. “He was intimidated, obviously. There was a police officer with a gun in the holster talking to my son, saying, ‘Tell me what you said.’ He didn’t have anybody on his side.” Officers also spoke to the children’s parents, and the incident was reported to the New Jersey Division of Child Protection and Permanency. Collingswood Police Chief Kevin Carey stated during a meeting with school officials that they should report incidents to police, including cases “as minor as a simple name-calling incident that the school would typically handle internally.” Police also said they were advised to refer almost every case to Child Protection and Permanency. This policy was a shift from the previous one under the Memorandum of Agreement between the police and schools in New Jersey, under which incidents were reported only when deemed serious enough. Such action was typically taken in cases involving drugs, weapons or sexual assault. Since the meeting, officers have been called to the school as often as five times per day. “Some of it is just typical little-kid behavior,” teacher Megan Irwin said. “Never before in my years of teaching have I felt uncomfortable handling a situation or felt like I didn’t know how to handle a situation.” The mayor, police and Camden County Prosecutor’s Office ultimately arranged a meeting to discuss incidents.  “In our discussion today, you and your staff made it abundantly clear that our recent meeting was to reinforce the applicability of the Memorandum of Agreement, but not to expand its terms,” Collingswood Mayor Jim Maley wrote in a letter to the prosecutor’s office, the Collingswod Patch reported.  Sources: Philadelphia Inquirer, Collingswood Patch / Photo credit: Google Maps via Daily Mail
Speculation about Hillary Clinton’s health continues to grow after her 9/11 fainting and overheating spell that forced her to leave a remembrance service early. She has released some medical records on Wednesday as rumors persisted. However, most people still don’t believe what she has to say. The released records have caused even more speculation and wonder especially over Clinton’s lack of transparency. Dr. Lisa Bardack released a letter that showed Clinton actually had surgery in January because of a severe sinus infection. But Clinton never revealed this to the public. Doctors put a drain in Clinton’s ear in order to clear the fluid that came as a result of her infection. Apparently it made her better. People have intimidated that she likely had a myringotomy. A CT scan in March showed that she had healed up well. Bardack wrote in her report, “This scan showed no abnormalities of the brain and mild chronic sinusitis. The symptoms resolved and she continued symptom-free for the next six months.” While a sinus infection certainly is nothing to serious the major problem people have is with her dishonesty. Why keep it a secret? Why be dishonest? Why lack transparency? Read the full transcript here.   Clinton’ campaign has a notable and widely publicized issue with transparency and honesty. She is well aware of the fact that many people think this about her and question the veracity of her healthy status. Thus, to be dishonest through a lie of omission seems simply stupid. Clinton is many things but stupid isn’t one of them. So why the lies? The public had a right to know about the health of the people running for the highest office in the land. It’s a perfectly reasonable line of questioning. To brush it off as a conspiracy theory is wrong, which Clinton has done. And it further shows people they have something to be concerned about. 
I can’t believe this nonsense. You’re going to be mad that I told you this. You’re going to wonder where the toughness of America went and what happened to make people think being a p*ssy is the way to be. When I look at cops, I envision people who are strong, tough, and hard working. Except for that one overweight cop that every station has. You know, the guy who actually eats the donuts. Forget him. He’ll be on desk duty eventually. I’m talking about real cops. The cops I know are all in good shape, work out, and run towards danger. They will save any person that’s in harms way. They don’t care if the person is white, black, or even Muslim. A good cop saves everyone, and that’s what most cops are – good cops. And that’s how it’s supposed to be. But then there’s this idiot from the LA Police Commission who wants cops to run AWAY from armed suspects. Are you kidding me? That’s ridiculous. Cops are trained to eliminate threats, not run away from the threat while the criminal either gets away or hacks someone with a meat cleaver.  The Daily Caller – The Los Angeles Police Commission wants LAPD police officers to run away when a suspect confronts them with a weapon, warns the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the labor union of the city’s police officers. Hypothetically speaking, if I wanted to rob a bank tonight, could I go there with a knife and the cops will run away from me? I don’t have to stab anyone, I just have to show cops that I have a deadly weapon and the cops will run to their cars and drive away. Is that how it works? That opens the Pandora Box for an unwarranted increase in crime based on the fact that LAPD might be ordered to run away from violent perpetrators in the future. I guess the LAPD won’t be allowed to save lives anymore. Very sad state of affairs if this really happens. I hope every LAPD cop does the right thing and does not listen to this nonsense. Cops are trained for battle and they’re not afraid to eliminate a violent threat. And we should let them eliminate a threat if it puts anyone in danger. Training people to run away, instead of eliminating, will generate a nation of p*ssy cops and that’s not who I want to protect me. 
Scammer-turned reality show star-turned-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump chatted with Fox News’s Bill O’Reilly last night and commenced to bash our military, as one does when running for the White House while trying to garner the patriotic™ conservative vote. While insulting President Barack Obama, Donald also took shots at the military, calling troops the “gang that couldn’t shoot straight.” In just 15 seconds, Donald said “win” or “winning” nine times in less than 15 seconds while offering no details  on how he would obtain these ‘wins.’ Trump says "win" or "winning" nine times in less than 15 seconds to @oreillyfactor: pic.twitter.com/yDs6v1Jjhz — Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) September 20, 2016  “Well, I know how to win. I know how to win. I have been winning. I do win. Even in sports. I win,” Donald told O’Reilly. “And we don’t win. Our country doesn’t win. We don’t win at trade. We don’t win. We can’t beat ISIS. Can you imagine General Douglas MacArthur or General Patton? Can imagine they are spinning in their grave right now when they see the way we fight,” he continued. “We announce that we are sending certain people over here at a certain time. Everything is political. It’s very, very sad. Then we bomb the Syrian troops. You saw that over the weekend. We bombed, I guess we killed more than 80 troops.” Watch:  At that point, Donald seemed concerned that Russia would be upset with the U.S. even though they were consulted beforehand. And now Russia is absolutely furious at us. But we bomb the wrong people. I mean, we are like the gang that couldn’t shoot straight. Our country, with this leader, is the gang that couldn’t shoot straight. That’s what it is. The United Stats made a tactical error and accidentally bombed a detachment of Syrian government forces Saturday after mistakenly believing them to be ISIS forces. “The United States has relayed our regret through the Russian Federation for the unintentional loss of life of Syrian forces,” an Obama administration official announced at the time, according to Mediaite. However, the Russians, who appear to really want a Trump administration, criticized the bombings, even though again, they raised no objections when they were consulted before the incident took place. Russian diplomats then floated a Trump conspiracy theory, because of course: After the botched strike, Russian diplomats floated a Trump conspiracy theory that the Obama administration is actively helping ISIS. In fact, wherever the Islamic State abuts his enemies, Assad has actively assisted them with his own air power, while Putin has pursued a policy of allowing extremists to leave Russia and join ISIS. Donald offered no alternatives as to how he would prevent a botched bombing. He just says the word ‘win’ repeatedly and his supporters eat it up. So does Vladimir Putin, apparently. This man wants to get his little hands on the nuclear codes. Let that sink in for a moment. Shockingly, Sean Hannity, the Patriot, has been strangely quiet since Donald bashed our military. The rest of the media is probably waiting for Hillary to cough. Photo by Sara D. Davis via Getty.
You’d think that putting together a list of the 7 worst mass murderers in American history would be a straightforward task. Unfortunately, it’s not, because there are quite a few “mass murders” that most Americans don’t consider to fit the definition. For example, most people wouldn’t look at  the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Tulsa Race Riot, or 80 Branch Davidians dying when Bill Clinton’s Department of Justice moved in on them to be “mass murders.” So, as a definition, we’re talking about large killings on American soil, perpetrated by a single person or small group of people. What follows are the 7 worst mass murderers in American history.     Location: Newtown, Connecticut Nickname: Sandy Hook Massacre Year: 2012 Method: Semi-automatic rifle, semi-automatic pistol Deaths: 27 Adam Lanza had Asperger's syndrome and was anorexic and mentally ill; he became increasingly isolated and dysfunctional. On Lanza’s 20th birthday, he shot his mother four times in the head with one of her guns while she slept. Then he drove her car to the Sandy Hook Elementary School where he killed 20 children between the ages of 5 and 10, along with 6 adults. After he finished his murderous rampage, Lanza shot himself in the head and died on the scene.     Location: Blacksburg, Virginia  Nickname: Virginia Tech Massacre Year: 2007 Method: Two semi-automatic pistols Deaths: 32 Cho was born in South Korea, but was a legal resident of the United States. He had depression and anxiety problems and seemed to have extreme difficulty talking with people. Like Adam Lanza, some of his teachers were alarmed at the violent stories he wrote. In fact one of them, Lucinda Roy, said she was concerned for her safety when she met with him one on one and said she reported him to school authorities. Unfortunately, nothing was done. Cho spent months planning the attack, but it began in a bizarre fashion. Cho murdered Emily Jane Hilscher in her dorm room along with Ryan Clark who apparently tried to help her. There has been some speculation that Cho had a crush on her, but there doesn’t seem to be definitive proof of that. After killing both of them, Cho managed to escape back to his dorm room without being detected. There he mailed an angry, rambling manifesto to NBC. Two and a half hours after the first killings, Cho went to another building on campus and killed an additional 25 students and 5 teachers. Afterwards, Cho committed suicide by shooting himself in the head.     Location: New York, New York Nickname: Wall Street Bombing Year: 1920 Method: Dynamite (bomb) Deaths: 38 In 1920, a horse drawn carriage filled with 100 pounds of dynamite and 500 pounds of iron was parked outside the J.P. Morgan Bank in New York City. The bomb killed 38 people and wounded another 143. There was speculation that communists or anarchists were behind the bombing, but unfortunately, the perpetrator was never caught.     Location: Rancho Santa Fe, California Nickname: Heaven’s Gate Suicide Year: 1997 Method: Persuasion/suffocation Deaths: 38 Marshall Applewhite was the gay leader of the Heaven’s Gate Cult. Applewhite, who had such a hold over his followers that he convinced six of them to join him in being CASTRATED, told the cult members that they had to kill themselves in order to hitch a ride on a UFO hiding behind the Hale-Bopp comet. Over a THREE DAY LONG PERIOD, the cult members, including Marshall Applewhite, took phenobarbital and vodka, then put plastic bags over their heads and suffocated to death.     Location: Bath Township, Michigan Nickname: Bath School Disaster Year: 1927 Method: Dynamite/Pyrotol (bomb) Deaths: 44 Kehoe was the elected treasurer of the Bath Consolidated School Board and was temporarily appointed as the Bath Township Clerk. After losing an election for the position, Kehoe, who was also deep in debt, stopped maintaining his farm. Soon thereafter, his farm went into foreclosure. Adding to the pressure on Kehoe, his wife was ill with tuberculosis. Yet and still, Kehoe didn’t simply “snap.” He used his position as the school’s volunteer handyman to his advantage. It allowed him to spend MONTHS planting explosives near the Bath school. Kehoe started by murdering his own wife and then set his farm on fire. From there, Kehoe went to the school and set off the explosives he’d planted. Thirty seven children, most of whom were between the ages of 6 and 8, died in the explosions. However, Kehoe wasn’t done yet. After rescue efforts began, Kehoe drove up to a group including the school superintendent and detonated his truck, which was filled with dynamite. Kehoe and 6 victims died in the blast. When his farm was searched afterward, a sign with the words “Criminals Are Made, Not Born” was found.     Location: Orlando, Florida Nickname: Orlando nightclub shooting Year: 2016 Method: Semi-automatic rifle, Semi-automatic pistol Deaths: 49 Omar Mateen was a radical Muslim whose father supported the Taliban. Mateen’s wife knew the attacks were coming and even helped him scope out the Pulse Nightclub. Former classmates remembered Mateen cheering the 9/11 attacks. There was rampant speculation that Mateen was actually gay and taking revenge for being rejected by men in the club, but FBI sources have commented that they’ve found no evidence that Mateen was “secretly gay.” At 2:00 a.m., Mateen walked into the gay Pulse Nightclub in Orlando and started shooting. By the time he was done, 49 people were dead. During his rampage, Mateen called 911 and News 13 of Orlando in order to let people know he was pledging allegiance to ISIS. After the police arrived, Mateen took hostages. Eventually, SWAT stormed the building and Mateen was shot 8 times and killed.     Location: Oklahoma City Nickname: Oklahoma City Bombing Year: 1995 Method: Ammonium Nitrate (bomb) Deaths: 168 On April 19, 1995, which was the 2nd anniversary of the end of the Branch Davidian siege, a truck bomb was parked under the day care center in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. It contained more than 4000 pounds of ammonium nitrate and the explosion was enormous with 324 nearby buildings damaged or destroyed while 168 people died and 680 were injured. Within an hour and a half of the bombing, Timothy McVeigh, the man who had driven the truck, was picked up on a traffic stop and quickly linked to the bombing. After searching the house of McVeigh’s father, evidence led the FBI to his co-conspirator, Terry Nichols. Nichols turned himself in. At the trial, it was revealed that Lori Fortier knew about the bombing, but did nothing to warn anyone. Her husband Michael actually helped scout the location. Timothy McVeigh was a militia member who was angry about government abuses in Waco and at Ruby Ridge and took his revenge with the bombing. In May of 2001, McVeigh was put to death by lethal injection. Nichols is still serving 161 life sentences. Michael Fortier, who testified against McVeigh and Nichols in return for leniency for his wife and a reduced sentence, served 10 1/2 years while his wife was given immunity.  
Matt Lauer is being skinned alive by the leftwingnut media for his honest presidential forum with Hillary and Trump.  They are calling for his head on a platter for asking Hillary about her email crimes. The rightwing saw the interview as a surprise since leftists normally do their utmost to shield Hillary and avoid exposing her crimes.  But then they saw that Lauer didn’t go into as much detail as they would have and that he did go after Trump, but not to the degree with which leftist fanatics would have and that has sent those leftwingnuts over the edge.  In the coming debate between Trump and Hillary they are calling on their moderators to “fact check” Trump, but not Hillary. The purpose of journalism is to inform you of events.  You are then free to decide your opinion of those events.  Opinions expressed in the media are supposed to be from either the public or the editors.  But that is not what the leftist media practices today.  Remember the 2nd Romney-Obama debate?  The moderator took over debating Romney and backed Obama’s lie that he said the assassination of Ambassador Stevens was a terror attack.  Even though she admitted she lied the next day the damage was done. I am not a journalist.  I have a degree in journalism, but that doesn’t make me a journalist.  I do not work for the media and I do not report the news.  I am a blogger.  I do not report events.  I express my opinion of events.  Before you read my articles I expect you to already know the ‘who, what, when, where, and how’ of events.  If you are ignorant because you listen to the leftwingnut media spin then you will probably think my opinion is wrong because you think my facts are lies.  There are leftwingnuts who have chastised bloggers as false because we express our opinions, as if by doing so that makes what we say not the truth.  Expressing your opinion of an event does not make the facts of that event a lie – except in the narrow minds of ignorant liberals. I have also been chastised that I do not make good arguments because I am not politically correct and considerate of people’s feelings.  I’m from the Forrest Gump/Larry the Cable Guy school of education and believe that “Stupid is as stupid does” and “You can’t fix stupid.”  Intelligent people will learn from what I write and if they are ignorant of the facts I present they will take the time to learn.  The difference between ignorance and stupidity is that ignorance is a lack of knowledge that can be amended through education.  Stupidity is an inability to learn, whether accidentally or purposely, and cannot be cured, but must be defeated.  The reason we have Obama is because stupid people believed what he said rather than examined his background and elected him on the basis of lies. Back in the eighties, I stopped watching television news when I realized all of it was biased anti-Reagan BS.  Reagan undid the Fairness Doctrine that Democrats had inflicted on media back under Truman so that they could control the media’s content.  With that boot lifted of the throats of conservatives there arose the rightwing media led by Rush Limbaugh and FOX News.  Rush has been a godsend expressing the opinions of the Silent Majority that had not permitted to speak over the airwaves.  Add to that a network that not only reported events, but had both sides express their opinions and the Moral Majority not only had a voice once again, but was able to debate with liberals openly so that both sides could be heard together!  That’s why leftists want to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine to shut us down and silence us again.  It’s not about making the Internet fair, it’s about censoring what is right and true. This is the dirty little secret that the Left doesn’t want people to know, which is why they say FOX News lies about everything.  Whenever someone actually watches FOX and the Democrat media side-by-side they discover that the Left is a pack of looney lies and they can get far more of the truth and good sense from FOX.  Even listening to liberals on FOX trying to twist the truth in their arguments with conservatives reveals their ideology to be based on deception. But Trump’s relentlessness has forced the Left to come out from under their cover as supposed journalists and reveal themselves to be nothing more than Democrat propagandists.  The result is that the people no longer trust the media.

Three significant events occurred on Capitol Hill this week. John Stumpf, CEO of Wells Fargo, was grilled by the Senate Banking Committee over unethical and potentially illegal account management practices at his bank. John Koiskinen, head of the IRS, appeared before a House impeachment hearing to answer for destruction of evidence and obstruction charges from House Republicans. We also saw Heather Bresch, Mylan CEO, appear before another House committee in response to an investigation into the flurry of Epipen price gouging accusations. In each case, the common response from the senior person in charge was, “I take full responsibility for . . .”, followed by a delineation of the problems, excuses and diversionary issues that are obvious to anyone looking at their particular quandary. Yes, CEO Stumpf was RESPONSIBLE for the actions of Wells Fargo bankers who opened 2 million fake accounts. He was, in fact, the CEO, and those individuals all reported up through his AOR (area of responsibility). Yes, Director Koiskinen did head up and was RESPONSIBLE for the IRS during a time when Cogress was reviewing the practice of delaying conservative non-profit tax determinations and destruction of evidence under subpoena in the IRS. The individuals who trashed hard drives, delayed FOIA requests and pled the 5th in response to sincere congressional inquiries did, in fact, report up to him. Yes, Ms. Bresch is RESPONSIBLE for the entirety of pricing decisions and financial results at Mylan as its CEO. Whoever determined that the Epipen should be repriced up to $800 from $300, when Mylan holds the sole injection delivery patent and can produce the only generic option, did, in fact, work in the organization for which CEO Bresch was responsible. What was largely ignored in each of their congressional inquiries is the difference between RESPONSIBILITY and ACCOUNTABILITY. One can be responsible for overseeing the actions of those who report to them, but being accountable is a completely separate issue. For too long, and in too many positions of leadership, particularly in the public, non-market sector, the person in charge who was ‘responsible’ has not been held accountable. It’s well documented how difficult it is to fire a federal employee, despite how many hours they spent watching porn in their cubicle, or how many VA appointment records they falsified. The private sector and it’s free-market mechanisms are more effective at isolating accountability to individuals. However, it is is equally well-documented that a corporate firing normally comes attached with a public statement of ‘early retirement’ and a comfortable golden parachute to soften the landing for the exited executive. Rarely, are corporate and public leaders truly held accountable for the actions and results over which they are responsible. As Senator Warren delivered her strong and rightful rebuke of Stumpf, it should be noted that she could similarly be asked, “where are my promised $2500 savings from Obamacare?, “why did I have to give up my doctor on passage of the AACA?”, “how do you explain the $20 trillion in national debt my as yet unborn grandchildren now own?”, “why is the VA still mistreating our veterans?”, etc. It’s easy to be ‘responsible’ for something . . . once elected or landed in position, to sit in a corner office and collect a nice paycheck and guaranteed pension, while telling someone else what to do, all the while hiding behind bureaucracy, complicated regulations and processes, human resources and legal staffs, and corporate and government committees. It’s far different to be ‘accountable’, and made to personally and individually own the results of the actions which occurred on one’s watch or direction. One might define bureaucracy as the textbook example of ‘responsibility with accountability.” If so, then the reverse would be ‘accountability without responsibility”, which many would say is what happened to the fired bankers at Wells Fargo. Some would also describe that as terrifying. America at its best functioned under the idea of individual responsibility – hard work, gaining an education, making wise choices, providing for oneself and family, pursuing the American Dream, and being a productive member of your community and society. Under individual responsibility, one has to own the results of their actions, accept accountability – consequences – for their shortfalls and mistakes, and then decide how to move forward. A running back, given responsibility to hold onto the football, who has a fumbling problem will find himself experiencing the consequence (accountability) of getting to sit on the bench. A bank robber who takes the responsibility of relieving the local branch of their cash will normally be held accountable for their actions in a Federal penitentiary. As the ideas of collective responsibility, corporatism and crony capitalism have taken root – closely tied to the expanding power of the public sector, in government, academia and the closely-aligned media, and the growing interconnectedness of private and public enterprise – individuals are absolved of the consequences of their individual actions and can hide behind the system, the process, the complexities, the nuanced views, and the collective weight of administrative machinery that grinds down any effort to reward or place accountability on the individual. The private sector retains many aspects of individual responsibility, as we saw this week in the willingness of Mr. Stumpf and Ms. Bresch to appear before the inevitably-hostile congressional panels. They made gallant efforts to defend their respective corporate positions, knowing they would have a board of directors to report back to, and legal departments anxious to avoid class-action suits based on their CEO’s public comments. In each case, though, neither Stumpf, Koiskinen or Bresch understood the notion of accountability. Saying ‘I’m sorry this happened’ isn’t enough. Saying ‘we’ll make it right’ doesn’t cut it. Promising that ‘we’ll do better next time’ is a hollow statement. Yes, they should each be sorry and filled with personal sorrow. Let’s hope they are sincere in the promising of refunding fees and repairing the shattered credit of thousands. Let’s even assume they’ll fix the 501c3 application process, quit destroying records under subpoena, and make the price of life-saving Epipens affordable to every Family. Those are all actions for which they are responsible, they control the budgets, organizations, plans and activities of their enterprises,and as the senior leaders, they can personally make those actions happen. There’s still the matter of accountability . . . consequences. Mr. Stumpf, careers were ruined and lives were thrown into turmoil by the actions of Wells Fargo, for which you were responsible and, not coincidentally, you and many others profited enormously. Mr. Koiskinen, you allowed the IRS to subvert the will of the people to oversee and correct the oppressive actions of the government’s most-feared agency, while retaining your position, power and pension. Ms. Bresch, under your watch and your authority, Mylan took advantage of countless families with no other options, earning millions for your company and yourself. You were all responsible. Now, how will you be held accountable? That remains to be seen. Even among our most revered and senior leaders, responsibility is rarely joined with accountability. Hillary ‘took responsibility’ for the Benghazi disaster and deaths of four Americans, her home-brew email server spewing classified secrets, and forgetting scores of classified briefings. Now she’s running for President. Four brave Americans were accountable and took on the consequence for our potential future president’s actions or indecision. Spare us for thinking that personal accountability is a rare concept in 21st Century America. 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign is in shambles and he is doing his best to soak the government for as much money as possible before he is humiliated at the ballot box by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Trump’s latest escapade has been to swindle $1.6 million from the U.S. Secret Service for the honor and privilege of protecting him, according to FEC filings. The Secret Service has a policy of reimbursing the campaigns of presidential candidates for the costs incurred due to various agents traveling with the candidate. Typically a campaign will pay for the airfare of the Secret Service, and the campaign is then reimbursed those funds. However, Trump has found a way to make a profit through this policy by chartering planes to the Secret Service owned by, TAG Air, Inc, one of his companies. Therefore, the Secret Service – and the American taxpayer- are literally paying Trump. This is in sharp contrast to Hillary Clinton’s campaign which has been chartering planes through Executive Fliteways, to which Clinton has no financial dealings or hopes of personal reimbursement. One’s imagination does not require a stretch to see the outrage amongst fanatical Trump supporters if Clinton were profiting from her travel, but selective outrage is their stock and trade. Trump’s campaign says there is nothing illegal about what they’ve done. A spokeswoman of Trump’s campaign, Hope Hicks, said, “Everything was done in accordance with FEC guidelines and regulations. Please direct further questions to USSS.” Along with Secret Service payments, Trump may also be soaking news organizations for the costs of journalists traveling with his campaign for the same reasons. It is also possible the Secret Service has been forced to pay Trump when their agents sleep in his grotesque golden hotels, as Trump stays at his own properties whenever possible. This is likely because he enjoys sleeping on the cheapest Chinese made beds money can buy.
From the Daily Caller News Foundation: Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton outspent Republican nominee Donald Trump by $31 million, and still trails Trump in some swing state polls. “Our expenditures on advertising, our expenditures on people, our expenditures on everything are a tiny fraction. And yet we’re minimum tied,” Trump told supporters at a rally in North Carolina Tuesday. “If you can spend less and be winning, that’s a positive thing, right?” Clinton and Dems outspent Trump and GOP by $31 million last month, to no effect | https://t.co/0nuHz9tOYL — Mike Doran (@Doranimated) September 21, 2016  Much of Clinton’s spending was made up of campaign ads. Clinton spends $10 million or so every week, across 11 states and ran almost 36,000 commercials. Trump only paid for about 7,500 commercials during the month of August. Trump’s largest expenditure was $11 million for digital consulting and online ads. Clinton started the month of August with a 64.8 percent chance of winning, according to statistics site 538, and the latest analysis gave Clinton a 57.1 percent chance of winning. The Real Clear Average gives Clinton a 1.1 percent lead over Trump at 45 percent to Trump’s 43.9 percent. Clinton started August with 44 percent in a head-to-head poll average, and Trump had 43.5 percent. Trump and Clinton were tied in the swing state of Florida at 43 percent each in the beginning of August, and both are now tied at 45 percentage points in the Real Clear Average for the state.

A Daisy of a Rerun I am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.  The year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson “approved” that message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly “war mongering” opponent, Barry Goldwater. Today, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnson’s deceitful war policies, Goldwater’s vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nation’s media. I mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign. Obviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a “Daisy” remake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers. Somehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweigh Goldwater’s 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events. Instead, today’s voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as “news and views.” With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, the media’s reaction of ridicule was to be expected. Now, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailing Ted’s “dramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.” This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a “pathological liar” and “utterly amoral.” As the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of “’Lyin Ted,’ insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.” These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder. Schools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph? Another safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say “derogatory” when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the “liberal press” moniker has now everyday acceptance. It is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public’s re-airing.  Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation. Also, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format and résumés of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion. These quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections. With that, consider the President’s past considerations of today’s democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, “She will say anything and change nothing. Hillary can’t be trusted and isn’t qualified to be President.” Obviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent, it’s damning, given the time frame. Also during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine:  “If you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the White House.”  Apparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review. Again, wouldn’t it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!

NASCAR officials have been working hard for a couple weeks now on how they really ant post race inspections to look. We’ve seen NASCAR’s Executive Vice President, Steve O’Donnell, speak out several times over the matter of post race inspections and how he’d like them to go. Basically, he wants the attention off of that aspect of things so estate everyone can focus on good racing. So in order for that to happen, O’Donnell and the rest of the executives have changed the format a bit, as we all know by now! They cut out the lower two tears of the penalty system and are only focusing on issuing penalties for failing post race laser inspection if the car fails it to a large degree.  However, executives realize that this may give drivers some leeway for cheating tactics. And Steve O’Donnell is trying to nip that in the bud. In a meeting this past weekend at New Hampshire, he made himself very clear as to what their expectations from the drivers were. “I want to make clear to everybody here that in NASCAR’s judgment, any measures that are taken to circumvent what happens for postrace inspection, we are going to react. We know that’s subjective. But ask all of you not to put it in our hands because we will react if we have to. I think everybody knows what that means. We want to concentrate on the race. … We couldn’t be more clear. I hope everybody agrees with that.” It’s awesome to see the officials making themselves clear and being open about their expectations!  We’ll see how open they are in the future however, seeing that O’Donnell didn’t clarify what cheating was in their books. There are allegations that “no cheating” might even include stopping the drivers from weaving back and forth on the cool down lap. Only time will tell! 
Who would have thought that the man most able to hold his head up with dignity after the Republican primaries would be Jeb Bush? The election may not have been kind to him, but unlike many of his former Republican competitors he’s had the integrity to resist bowing down to Trump (*cough* Marco *cough* Carson *cough* Christie *cough*). Instead, he’s joined other Republican leaders in flatly stating that he will never vote for Donald Trump. During the Emmy’s, Jeb was able to even give an incredible middle finger to Donald Trump and the Republican voters who nominated him with a surprisingly hilarious cameo with show host Jimmy Kimmel. It begins with Jimmy getting into a limo and discovering that Jeb is now an Uber drive. It ends with Jeb crying “Jeb exclamation point!” and peeling out. In between is a brutal dig at the stupidity of the average Trump voter giddy at their candidate’s childish behavior. WATCH: “JEB EXCLAMATION POINT!” Jeb Bush, now driving around Selina Meyer. #Emmys @JimmyKimmel https://t.co/vWxFC9qbXu — Good Morning America (@GMA) September 19, 2016  Jeb’s best line: “If you run a positive campaign the voters ultimately will make the right choice.” When Kimmel starts to agree, Jeb flips the script. “Jimmy, that was a joke…” And now we have Donald Trump, and his supporters don’t seem to care if he promotes bigotry or lies on a regular basis. Jeb Bush certainly didn’t belong in the White House, but he may just have a shot at Hollywood. At least he can laugh at himself – and at the voters suckered into supporting the Republican nominee.

New riots have broken out in Charlotte, North Carolina. Live stream is at the bottom of article. Last night unrest broke out in the city after a black police officer shot and killed a black man who refused to drop his firearm when instructed to. After family members stoked angry crowds by saying that Keith Lamont Scott was holding a book when he was shot, and not a gun as the black police chief explained, mobs of black youth began looting, rioting, and attacking police & civilians. One person has been shot by another rioter tonight. The person shot has died even though police attempted to get him medical attention. Per CMPD Chief Putney on Fox News right now: Person shot in Uptown has died #KeithLamontScott #CLTNews — Nick Ochsner (@NickOchsnerWBTV) September 22, 2016    Rioters are throwing bottles and projectiles at police, and law enforcement is responding with tear gas and non-lethal weapons such as rubber bullets. Stores in downtown Charlotte are currently being looted.

Viewers of tonight’s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump  who decide to drink every time Trump tells a lie could very well die of alcohol poisoning, according to the US Surgeon General. After the series of “clown car debates” of 2012, an average of 70,000 additional alcohol poisoning related incidents occurred. Due to the frequently untrue nature of Trump’s comments, first responders are bracing for a potentially more disastrous incident tonight. According to Politico, Trump lied every three minutes and 15 seconds throughout a five day period from Sept. 15 – Sept 20. Medical professionals found themselves in a similar situation last year, before the GOP primary debates. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said “We are anticipating record levels of alcohol poisoning… all across the country, as Americans engage in drinking games while they watch the debate. We can’t impress enough on people about the danger of mixing alcohol and watching the GOP debates, especially with the field the Republicans are giving us this year.” Given the candidate they ultimately chose, the potential for fabrications tonight are higher than ever. The Mayo Clinic reports that signs of alcohol poisoning include vomiting, confusion, seizures, slow breathing (seven breaths a minute or less), blue-tinged or pale skin, hypothermia, and not being able to be woken up after falling asleep. Please do your fact-checking as responsibly as possible.            
To cap off a week in which police officers shot and killed two unarmed black men, a Georgia police officer has been arrested after it was discovered that she had fabricated a story about being shot by black man. Jackson Officer Sherry Hall has been charged with “false statements, tampering, interference with government property and a violation of oath of office.” “After following leads and evidence, the investigation has now revealed that there is no, and never was, a suspect shooter at large in Jackson, Georgia” announced special agent Joe Wooten, who was investigating the “case.” Hall reported that on September 13th, a black man had shot her in her bulletproof vest, but it was discovered that the entire thing – radio call, tear in shirt, spent shell – was all a set-up. The story is a stark reminder that the word of the police cannot always be taken at face value. When a protester was shot in the head during the Charlotte riots, the police immediately announced it was a civilian-on-civilian shooting, but multiple eyewitness reports say that it was a rubber bullet fired by riot police. A picture emerged of recently slain disabled black man Keith Lamont Scott showing a gun on the ground – but the video released by his grieving wife shows no gun but instead shows a cop dropping his glove. A police officer in St. Louis, Missouri, was recently charged with a homicide after it was discovered he had shot and killed a black man and then planted a gun on his body to justify his murder. In an increasingly post-truth political atmosphere, we must demand and receive evidence. We cannot rely on the word of anybody – our politicians or police officers.
PARIS — France has apparently become the first country in the world to ban plastic plates, cups and utensils, passing a law that will go into effect in 2020. Exceptions will be allowed for items made of compostable, biosourced materials. The new law is a part of the country’s Energy Transition for Green Growth Act, the same legislation that also outlawed plastic bags in grocery stores and markets beginning in July. Although plastic bags are forbidden in other countries — including in some U.S. states — no country seems to have embraced a plastic ban as sweeping as France’s will be. The general idea behind the law — following the landmark conference held in Paris last fall on curbing global warming — is to promote a “circular economy” of waste disposal, “from product design to recycling,” French lawmakers say. [A Maryland county’s nickel tax for plastic bags is paying off, but not as planned] Objections to plastic as a material are well known. For one, it does not biodegrade and only breaks down into smaller and smaller particles, which pose a significant danger for wildlife that cannot always distinguish it from food sources, particularly in oceans. Aside from ecosystem disruptions, millions of barrels of oil are used every year in manufacturing plastic bags and utensils, playing what environmental activists call a significant role in climate change. In the words of French President François Hollande, the ban is part of a larger push intended “to make France … an exemplary nation in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, diversifying its energy model and increasing the deployment of renewable energy sources” -- starting, it would seem, with the forks and knives distributed at fast-food restaurants and the coffee cups in vending machines. Not all share the enthusiasm of France’s Socialist government, which has made environmental progress one of its main goals. In Brussels, some argue that the laws violate existing European Union legislation regarding the free movement of goods and the protection of manufacturers. Eamonn Bates, the secretary general of Pack2Go Europe, a Brussels-based association that represents packaging manufacturers on the continent, told the Associated Press that his organization will challenge France’s ban. “We are urging the European Commission to do the right thing and to take legal action against France for infringing European law,” he said. “If they don’t, we will.” Supporters of the ban wanted it to be introduced earlier, possibly as soon as 2017. But Ségolène Royal, the French environment minister, had initially considered it an “anti-social” provision, on the grounds that low-income families relied on plastic utensils and plates. The ban was then postponed until 2020.
#5. Denmark pays students $900 a month to attend college. Thanks to Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders’ proud identification as a Democratic Socialist and allusion to Denmark as an ideal social democracy, Denmark is being discussed throughout the news media. But what few outlets are brave enough to report is that, by almost every measurable standard, Danish socialism runs circles around American capitalism. Here are a few examples:  Denmark has a tremendous social safety net for unemployed workers — any worker who worked at least 52 weeks over a three-year period can qualify to have 90 percent of their original salary paid for, for up to two years. The Danish government also has plentiful training programs for out-of-work Danes. As a result, 73 percent of Danes between 15 and 64 have a paying job, compared to 67 percent of Americans. World Bank data on healthcare costs in developed nations. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), the US spends twice as much per capita on healthcare than in Denmark, where taxpayer-funded universal healthcare is available for all citizens. 2009 OECD data shows that the U.S. spent an average of $7,290 per person on healthcare. Denmark spent just $3,512. World Bank data, as seen in the chart above, shows Danish healthcare costs are about $3,000 less per capita than in the US.  The World Happiness Report, which determines which nation’s population is the “happiest” using criteria like life expectancy, GDP, social safety nets, as well as factors like “perception of corruption” and “freedom to make life choices,” found that Denmark was the happiest country. The US, in the meantime, ranked #17 on the same list.  Denmark leads every other OECD nation in work-life balance. Danes work an average of 37 hours a week, earn an average of $46,000 USD annually, and have the right to 5 weeks of paid vacation per year. Here in the US, the average worker puts in an average of 47 hours a week, and only takes 16 days of vacation a year. This is largely due to a more stressful work climate, in which wages are stagnating while costs are rising. Combine that with a highly-competitive job market, and that means more Americans are willing to chain themselves to their desk then to risk taking vacation days and coming back to find someone else took their job. An actual college campus in Denmark. Here in the US, the cost of going to college has soared by over 500 percent in the last 30 years. But in Denmark, not only is college free, but students are actually paid $900 USD per month to go to school, provided they live on their own. And this funding lasts up to six years. By contrast, the average US student pays over $31,000 a year in tuition to attend a private university, out-of-state residents at public universities pay $22,000 a year in tuition, and tuition costs for in-state residents at those same universities is still over $9,000. Per capita income data from the World Bank. In Denmark, despite a short work week and a generous social safety net, workers make more than enough to meet basic needs. According to per capita income data from the World Bank, Denmark’s per capita income is roughly $5,000 higher than in the US.  The benefits of living in Denmark are far-reaching — out of all OECD countries, Denmark has the second-lowest poverty rate at 0.6 percent. To compare, the OECD average of 11.3 percent is still lower than the 14.5  percent poverty rate in the US. So all this socialist nanny-state coddling must be making all the businesses flee Denmark as fast as they can, right? Wrong.  In 2014, Forbes ranked Denmark as the #1 best country for business. Forbes used 11 different criteria to rank countries — innovation, property rights, red tape, taxes, investor protection, stock market performance, technology, corruption, personal freedom, freedom of trade, and monetary freedom. Under the same criteria, the US ranked #18.  The Danish government gives new parents an average of 52 weeks — a full year — of paid time off after having a child. Those 52 weeks can be allocated however the parents wish. In addition to the 52 weeks, new moms get 4 weeks of maternity leave before giving birth and 14 weeks after. Even new fathers get 2 additional weeks after the birth of their child. But here in the US, 1 in 4 new mothers go back to work within two weeks of having a child. This is what Democratic Socialism really looks like. Is this the dystopian nightmare that Republicans are making it out to be, or an ideal vision of what Americans could have if we came together and demanded it from our government?          
The hosts of were hoping a Minnesota police chief would vilify the Somali immigrants in his community and they promptly got their asses handed to them. On Saturday, 22-year-old Dahir A. Adan went on a stabbing spree inside a Minnesota mall. The Somali community in St. Cloud has roundly condemned the act of terrorism, but Republican nominee Donald Trump spewed fear and hate in response during a phone call with Fox and called the immigrants a âTrojan horseâ and a âcancer from withinâ that benefits ISIS. Fox host Steve Doocy, who was named in Gretchen Carlsonâs sexual harassment lawsuit against the conservative network, asked St. Cloud Police Chief William Blair Anderson if he agrees with Trumpâs assessment of immigrants, clearly hoping that Anderson would join in demonizing them. Instead, Anderson swatted Doocy down like the pest he is and made it clear that there are bad apples in every group and that we should unite rather than divide and hate. âMy job is public safety. Itâs not in immigration policy. I can tell you that the vast majority of all of our citizens, no matter their ethnicity, are fine, hard-working people, and now is not the time for us to be divisive. We already have a very cohesive community, and I expect that this will draw us even closer together. But at the end of the day, our job is public safety, period.â Anderson then explained that law enforcement works well with all members of the community to protect the public the best they can. âWe actually work very well not just with our East African community, but all of our community. We meet regularly with any number of people, whether they are advocates for a specific ethnicity or different cause. Itâs one of things that makes St. Cloud a wonderful place to live, and I know that might sound corny, but itâs the truth. We have established and maintained a very good rapport with our East African community and our community at large.â Doocy then tucked his tail between his legs and ended the interview because he didnât get the response he wanted. Hereâs the video via  Demonizing an entire community simply because of the actions of a few only ostracizes them and could cause more to radicalize. Thatâs why we should reach out to these immigrants instead of hating them. Fox News is irresponsibly pushing an âus versus themâ mentality that only creates a never-ending circle of hate and mistrust that hurts our country in the long-term. But letâs also remember that ISIS would not exist to recruit people in America in the first place had Republicans not pursued an unnecessary war in Iraq that created the power vacuum that allowed ISIS to rise. Furthermore, despite their concerns and their whining, Republicans still refuse to declare war on ISIS to give President Obama the full resources of the United States to fight the terrorist organization. Regardless, any group will have bad apples, even the white âChristiansâ Fox News caters to. Letâs not forget that Timothy McVeigh committed the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 that killed 168 people while Dylan Roof gunned down nine black people inside a church in 2015. Both acts of domestic terrorism were committed by white males who were born here in the United States. But Fox News would rather freak out about a Somali immigrant who used a knife in an attack in which no one was killed. If Adan were white, not only would this not be referred to as an act of terror, it would have been a mere footnote in the news. 
The scramble to cover-up the Hillary email scandal has come to light. The Platte River IT executives were not ignorant to what was going on. As subcontractors, they tried to distance themselves from what was going on. One executive call it; Hillary’s cover-up operation. It is astonishing that the FBI and the whole of the Justice Department were unable (unwilling) to see this. Read more below.  As Written By Isabel Vincent and Melissa Klein for The New York Post: Computers from China and Russia tried to attack Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server, according to never-released e-mails from the Denver company that set up and maintained the system. And other internal e-mails show the IT executives fretted about being ordered to purge e-mails and scrambled to distance themselves from what they believed was the former first lady “covering up some shaddy [shady] s- -t.” In a gallows-humor message, one called it “Hillary’s coverup operation.” The FBI in July chastised Clinton and her aides over the use of the private server, saying, “They were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.” But the agency declined to recommend charges. The FBI report noted there were many hacking attempts into the system, both while Clinton was secretary of state and afterward when Platte River Networks took over the administration of the home server. The agency said none had been successful, and it never named the hackers or their points of origin. But multiple internal Platte River e-mails reviewed by The Post show that computers in China tried on three occasions in 2014 to log into Clinton’s server and a computer in Russia tried once in 2013. The internal communications also revealed how the execs belatedly tightened security on Clinton’s now-controversial home server and frantically sought to “cover our asses” when news broke that the former secretary of state’s communications were deleted. “Any chance you found an old e-mail with their directives to cut the backups back in Oct‐-Feb? . . .

Mohamed Hamada’s book The Trump Revolution is available for FREE here until the election.  Read Chapter II here.  The Leader, Donald Trump: Strong man, strong presence, strong will, aggressive. He is the only one who has taken our side and we are lucky he has. He knows all of the elite-businessmen’s dirty tricks, inside out. No businessman can buy him. When the people started the move, he stood up, and took the huge job on his back. He rolled up his sleeves and he is ready to lead. Can he get us what we hope? The stronger we support him the stronger he is. Let me tell you something Mr. and Mrs. elite- businessmen of the United States of America. You are lucky dogs that we have elections, a peaceful way to change, or we would have shown you what you hate. Now America, would you unite behind Trump? This issue is far beyond the republican nomination. Now to the elite-businessmen, would you have it the easy way and accept to deal with our negotiator, or would you prefer to deal with us hand to hand. Why Trump? First, he is the only one who cares for the main issues and offers decisive solutions to them. The other candidates avoid these problems. They follow the rules of the elite-businessmen so that they survive and keep their “jobs”, full-time politicians working for the elite-businessmen. Other than his personal characters, we mentioned before: He is an Insider. He knows who is who in that society of elite-businessmen. He knows what is going on and where are the problems. A strong man and a manager: In such broken system, you need someone who can impose leadership on others. Someone who can redefine and distribute the responsibilities to put a new functioning system in place. A manager knows how to make everyone work. He would make the businessman do his job that he is supposed to do for the country. I, personally have enough knowledge to rule a country, but I would not be able to make everyone do his job, not only do it, but do it as it should be done. A strong man, a businessman and a negotiator: He will negotiate on our behalf. He would not let a businessman sell our government what we don’t need. He would not let the businessman sell our army a $600 dollar toilet seat. He would not let the hospital sell $60.00 Jell-O and $100.00 pill of medicine knowing that the insurance companies would collect the money from us. A strong man and a builder: His job is construction which means that he builds. He oversees everything. He makes everyone do his work. He finishes what he starts then he stands with pride looking at the huge beautiful building he constructed. A builder does not know a half done job, he knows only the well fully completed job. Let me call on you America, all of you America, all the races, all the religions, all the ideologies and all the socio-economic classes; vote for your leader Donald J. Trump. How about the other candidates? They are playing the election game. The elite- businessmen want to see a well tamed candidate from each political color. They want to make sure that the American people are well distracted from their serious problems in ideological confrontation that avoids serious issues that touches the core of their lives. Cruz distracts the conservative people. Sanders would distract the very liberal people. The moderates would be distracted by the rest. Now everyone is distracted and none of these candidates would confront the elite-businessmen who are exploiting the people and destroying the country. We need a qualified, honest, strong man who is willing to confront the elite-businessmen. None of the other candidates is willing/ dares to touch the elite-businessmen. Trump is rich enough to finance his own campaign to some extent. Our role will come when the financial burden overwhelms him, we will support him with our little dollars. The river is made of water drops. He is not waiting for the elite-businessmen to spend on him and buy his allegiance. He is a man who will lead the country, not only rule it. The presidency at this critical point in history is not about an employee sitting on a nice disk in a fancy oval office. The presidency this time is leadership of a revolution.

Some athletes have taken to pulling ridiculous stunts during games to show their solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. But not Cam Newton — the Carolina Panthers quarterback lives in Charlotte and is seeing firsthand the damage these “protests” are causing his community. The riots have caused widespread damage, multiple police officers have been injured and at least one person has been killed. And Newton has had enough. He held a press conference to comment on the riots in Charlotte and criticized the black community’s response to the recent shooting of a black man by police, which is what spawned the riots. “I’m an African American. I’m not happy what or how justice has been dealt with over the years — the state of oppression in our community,” he said. “But we also as black people have to do right by ourselves, we can’t be hypocrites.” He also slammed the violence of the rioters. “When you get a person who does some unjust things or killing an innocent person, killing fathers, killing people who have actual families, that’s real,” he explained. “I have a son. And a daughter I’m responsible for. And how they feel if one day they come home and there’s no more daddy? We need people to be held accountable is that’s all.” Newton also criticized the Black Lives Matter protesters for focusing too much on race. “It doesn’t matter the race,” he said. “I don’t see that through a black/white lens. I could look at you and be around you and I can tell if you’re a good person. There’s good people that doesn’t have a badge on, there’s good people that has a badge on.”   Police aren’t all bad, Newton also claimed, something that likely infuriated the Black Lives Matter protesters. “We all know people who are in the police department. And we also know bad people that’s civilians, and just bad people who are police officers. That’s just life as a whole,” he said. “We all have to as United States citizens, just have to [be] accountable for what we do.” But it was what he said about the black community that likely truly infuriated the rioters. “When you look at the most dangerous cities in America. You know Atlanta, Birmingham, Chicago, Miami, Louisiana,” he explained, “I know from being a black person there’s a lot black people who don’t do right by black people, so you can’t be a hypocrite and say, ‘Oh well, a white man or a white police officer just killed a black man.'”   It’s the kind of common sense outlook that more people need to have. 
I don’t recall in any Presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day. Not only is Hillary Clinton’s health constantly making headline, but it’s also commonly a part of Presidential polls. The polls continue to show a Hillary decline as Hillary continues to show a health decline.  Here are the top takeaways from the poll: •More than 40% of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either “below average” or “very poor” health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between September 12 and 13. That’s a sharp departure from another Morning Consult poll taken just at the end of August, when only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar. •The share of voters who think Clinton’s health is “average” remained relatively flat at 28% in the new survey. By contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either “above average” or “excellent” health actually ticked upwards from late August, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of Clinton). •Voters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clinton’s potential medical issues. While Hillary Clinton is only 68 years-old, she’s one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. My mom is in her 60’s too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary, at least. Usually ‘looking old’ or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. I can’t see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillary’s health. The suspicion isn’t from one particular thing, it’s from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press. At one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other malady’s. It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and Multiple Sclerosis. Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting ‘confused and needing naps’, of which she was probably severely punished. And then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. Recently, another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone. While this picture alone wouldn’t mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way. Another of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs. Then there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking. It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someone’s arm. Here’s an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. If you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so that her voter don’t see her in person because she looks awful. And of course the coughing pictures, America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US, ever. Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives she’s gasping for air. It’s incredibly alarming to have such a sickly candidate because she could be the next *Cough Cough HmHmm Uck Khoff Khak Khak Gack — *GASP excuse me, President of the United States.  
Animal lovers, get your tissues ready, because you are about to bawl your eyes out, especially if you are a dog lover.  You know what? Don’t even read further if you are part of the man’s best friend club, you just might regret your decision to get out of bed this morning. News just hit the web that the locally famous three year-old dog named Loung, who fell out of a truck last year, landing on a busy route between Cambodia and Thailand, has been hit and killed by a car as it waited for the return of its owner for over a year. You can start the waterworks as we go into the details. The Sukhumvit Road, or Thailand Route 3, is a leading highway between Bangkok and Cambodia and Loung’s owner must not have realized that she had fallen right out of the truck. What’s truly amazing is that the dog refused to leave the area, hoping that one day her owner would return and rescue her.  Local people in the village of Ban Nong Khon in Chanthaburi province took the responsibility of feeding her as she waited for her owner. After some time had passed, Loung became somewhat of a celebrity for the locals and tourists, with many people stopping by weekly to take a photo with the lone dog. Many people would occasionally stop by the highway, claiming to be Loung’s true owners, but would be met with timidness and distrust, she would run off into the jungle as soon as someone tried to leash her up to take her.   Loung unfortunately met her end last week, with many photos of the dead and bloodied dog being released in the newspaper. That distasteful act caused so much outrage from many locals and social media users that the media companies took the photos down. The story has been going viral ever since. A dog lover’s club in Thailand has donated money for the funeral expenses of Loung…hoping to give a proper burial for such a loyal animal. 
The University of Vermont’s Burlington campus is flying a Black Lives Matter flag alongside both the American and state flags. The flag is being sponsored by the UVM Student Government Association, the president of which called the flag a way “to show symbolic support for our community.” The University of Vermont’s Burlington campus is flying a Black Lives Matter flag alongside both the American and state flags. Several students from the school took to social media to express their support for the move, with some saying the school is “winning for this” and another noting that since the school is supportive of the movement, “we should be too.” One local news outlet is reporting that the flag is being sponsored by the school’s Student Government Association (SGA), whose president called the move a way to “show symbolic support for our community.” [RELATED: KU library pushed BLM propaganda on students]  “The Student Government Association is sponsoring the flag at this time to show symbolic support for our community when so many are struggling with the violence and search for justice in this country,” SGA president Jason Maulucci wrote in a statement. “It is fitting that the flag flies adjacent to the recently engraved benches that pronounce the values of Our Common Ground—Respect, Integrity, Innovation, Openness, Justice, and Responsibility.” The flag apparently appeared on campus the day after… Read the rest of the story at Campus Reform  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.

First Lady Michelle Obama told Stephen Colbert on The Late Show on Tuesday night that she has no sympathy for Melania Trump with November’s presidential elections looming. Obama, 52, was asked by Colbert if she had any ‘sympathy’ for the pressures Melania, the wife of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, is facing. However, Obama was unequivocal in her response saying Melania had a choice not to support her husband.  Host Colbert said he had some sympathy for Melania following the plagiarism scandal at the Republican convention in July. She was accused of copying portions of a speech the First Lady had used in the past. When Colbert questioned Obama over the matter, she gave a blunt response. ‘Yeah, that was tough,’ the First Lady said, letting out a sly smile. Daily Mail She seems to really ENJOY the politics of personal destruction. In that case, no WONDER She’s proud of America ‘for the first time in her life’. Under her husband, that’s now POLICY. Share if you think ‘It was tough’ having Michelle as First Lady 
As Hillary Clinton would have you think, she is an advocate for the black community. However, she is really more of a snake. She not only takes their voted for granted but she also belittles them. How? She believes that all the black Americans want is more things for free. One young black American decided to take a stand against Hillary though, because she does not agree with her. Watch below as Hillary blatantly disrespects this woman, simply because she questions Hillary’s motives. INSULTER HILLARY! Hillary Clinton Insults A Young African American Voter #bigot #HillaryRottenClinton #HillaryKKK pic.twitter.com/67FOLtTuCu — Ted Hooley (@ed_hooley) August 27, 2016  Hillary warmly greeted the young woman, but her smile quickly faded when the woman brought up Clinton’s “super predator” remark as young black protesters have in the recent past. The former First Lady pointed out that during the early stages of her campaign, she professed to believing that racial profiling is wrong.   The Minnesota voter remained both unimpressed and undeterred in her quest to find out if the black community could count on Hillary Clinton to not flip-flop her belief system again if elected. Hillary was quick to say it is not true that she isn’t a friend to black Americans, and she directed the young woman to take a look at her history as a proffer of her commitment. “I don’t think that’s true. [I’ve looked] at your history and that’s not what happened,” the unidentified woman challenged again. “I will have a very comprehensive agenda to deal with a lot of the problems” was Hillary’s career politician, doublespeak non-answer. Hillary, if you cannot defend yourself against an unscripted question from a young American, then what makes you think you can beat Donald Trump at an on stage debate? For more, click here.
Allow me to begin by saying former DNC chair Howard Dean is the f*ckingÂ . After tweeting that Donald Trump might be on cocaine â a reasonable observation based on the GOPâs actions during the first presidential debate â he could have backed down under scrutiny. He could have caved and apologized. Instead, he made his case. Dean, a physician who is qualified to speculate â though in his own words not diagnose without examining Trump in person â responded to criticism of his remarks on MSNBC. âI donât make diagnosis on the television, itâs medically improper,â he told Kate Snow Tuesday, a subtle jab at Trump and his legion of Fox News âdoctorsâ feverishly trying to diagnose Clinton with every neurological disorder under the sun because she coughed that one time and contracted pneumonia the other. âBut I donât think this was a ridiculous idea. Something funny was going on with Trump last night.â Something âridiculousâ was indeed going on. Trump spent his evening screaming about ridiculous conspiracy theories, attacking his opponentâs âstaminaâ based on a minor illness, interrupting Clinton constantly, guzzling water, sweating profusely, and other things that would be expected from his meth-addled Twitter followers rather than a serious presidential candidate. âHereâs the interesting constellation: he sniffs during the presentation, which is something that users do. He also has grandiosity, which is something that accompanies that problem. He has delusions, Iâm not talking about being crazy, but for example when he told everybody he was very smart not to pay taxes and then denied that he said after he said it it in front of 100 million people,â Dean said. âHe thinks somehow heâs not going to get caught, that is delusional.â He has trouble with pressured speech,â the former Vermont governor added. âHe interrupted, as you pointed out, Hillary Clinton twenty-nine times. He couldnât keep himself together.â âDo I think at 70 years old he has a cocaine habit? Probably not,â Dean concludes.Â âBut itâs something that I think would be interesting to ask him, to see if he ever had a problem with that.â Asked for clarification if he thinks Trump has a âcocaine habit,â Dean replied âI donât think he has a cocaineÂ ,â placing special emphasis on the word âhabit.â In other words, it might be a stretch to say Trump isÂ  to cocaine, but it is possible that he used it to pep himself up before the debate. In an effort to deflect from the allegation, Trump assured the public that he just had a cold, but Stephen Colbert put it best when he said The Donald âsounded like he was trying to get over a cold using cocaine.â We canât know for sure if Trump has ever been treated for addiction, as he refuses to release his records â and since Trump should be held to the same standards to which he holds Hillary Clinton, itâs not unreasonable to question if he has been using cocaine (especially given the crazy, whacked-out bonkers stuff he says in public). Watch Dean SLAY this interview below:  
The question of what the role of a moderator is in a presidential debate has taken on a whole new significance during this election because Donald Trump, more so than any candidate in American history, has shown a willingness to lie, boldly and without apology, when he feels it suits him. His ability to say, with a straight face, obvious lies that a typical human would find impossible due to a profound sense of shame make his appearance on the debate stage a singular moment in history. Matt Lauer recently held what was billed as the “preview” of the debates with a one-on-one sit down with both candidates for an extended question-and-answer session. While Lauer grilled Clinton on her voting record and on (*sigh*) the emails, when it came time to question Trump he turned into a doormat. Critics slammed the embarrassing way Lauer allowed Trump to lie to his face without any pushback. In one particularly blatant example, Trump falsely claimed that he had been opposed to the Iraq War from the very beginning, an easily debunked lie that Lauer was surely aware of. The debates, many Americans hoped, would be different. If Trump chooses to openly lie to voters during the events, moderators should be expected to jump in and clarify the falsehoods. Needless to say, the person making the most noise about this change of plans is…Donald Trump. In an interview with Fox News, Trump claimed there would be people “watching” for moderators to fact check him and would react badly if he wasn’t allowed to say whatever he wanted. First, Trump slammed Candy Crawley, who famously corrected Mitt Romney during a debate with President Obama. It has often been seen as a pivotal moment in that debate and the real-time fact check threw Romney off of his game for the rest of the night. Trump would prefer he and Clinton get a chance to fight it out without interference, even if what he is saying are lies. You know, I think there’s a lot of pressure on [first debate moderator Lester Holt]. I think Lester’s a very good person, a very good man. I think there’s a lot of pressure on him. You know, when I had the town hall, last week with Hillary, I did well, and I had tough questions. But the polls all had her taking a drubbing….They went after Matt Lauer, and I’ve never seen anything like it….That’s what they’re doing with Lester Holt…and a lot of people are watching to see whether he succumbs to that pressure. The difference between Trump’s camp and Clinton’s couldn’t be more apparent here. While Democrats are demanding the truth be the focal point of the night, conservatives – including Trump himself – are telling moderators that they should not worry about what is a lie and what isn’t. As the Washington Post’s Greg Sergent noted: In other words, one side wants the moderators to hold the candidates accountable, and the other doesn’t. We can argue endlessly over whether those in the former camp are trying to game the debates so that Trump faces tougher questioning than Clinton does. But the bottom line is that, given that it is simply true that Trump lies a lot more frequently, audaciously, and egregiously than Clinton does, and that it took many months before this was widely acknowledged in the press, most Clinton supporters would probably be just fine with equivalent treatment of both of their assertions at the debate, and if they aren’t, they should be. Republicans want Trump to lie. Democrats simply want both sides to tell the truth. It’s rare in politics to find such a clear contrast.

If you’re ever looking for a dose of national commonsense, look no further than the great state of Texas. They are what the rest of the United States secretly wants to be, even California and New York. Governor Greg Abbot has put his foot down on “refugee resettlement” in his state and has made some very simple demands. Want to keep bringing Muslims into Texas? We need better security measures. Don’t feel like implementing such measures? Then we will no longer accept your refugees. Now THAT is leadership!  In a statement obtained by Breitbart, Abbot lays into the FBI and the refugee program. “The federal government’s refugee settlement program is riddled with serious problems that pose a threat to our nation,” Governor Abbott said in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. “The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Director of National Intelligence have repeatedly declared their inability to fully screen refugees from terrorist-based nations. Even with the inability to properly vet refugees from Syria and countries known to be supporters or propagators of terrorism, President Obama is now ineptly proposing a dramatic increase in the number of refugees to be resettled in the U.S.” I fully expect this same attitude to be adopted by all Republican states that aren’t run by progressives. This is something that needs to be shared across the United States and taken up by the federal government. There is no reason why the people we elected to protect us from foreign enemies should be importing people who could be putting us at risk. Abbot’s reaction wasn’t in response to the latest bombings in the United States, though I’m thoroughly convinced that was at the very least in the back of his mind. Instead, his comments came after the Texas Health and Human Services Commission wrote a letter to the head of the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement. In follow up to our request for approval of our application for an amended State Plan, I write to express the state of Texas’ intentions should you not unconditionally approve our application by September 30, 2016. The 2016 State Plan will no longer be current and continue in effect after September 30, 2016. That date is quickly approaching, and the Office of Refugee Resettlement has not yet approved our application for an amended State Plan. If you do not approve our State Plan as amended by September 30, 2016, we will interpret your silence as a rejection of the application. If our application is rejected -whether explicitly or by silence – the Health and Human Services Commission will be unable to certify that its State Plan is current and in effect, and will exit the Refugee Resettlement Program. We will notify contractors and impacted stakeholders that services and benefits will be provided for 120 days beyond October 1, 2016, or until January’ 31, 2017. America is a nation of immigrants, but we’re not (yet) a nation of idiots. While we should strive to help the people of the world in any way we can, we should not feel obliged to do so if it leaves us open to harm. 
Get Grist in your inbox Sweden again It’s a response to the strange situation we’re in, where buying and shipping a new pair of shoes to your doorstep can be cheaper than repairing your old ones. On Tuesday, Sweden’s ruling Social Democrat and Green Party coalition will submit a series of proposals to parliament. One would cut the tax rate on repairs to shoes, clothes, and bicycles from 25 to 12 percent, the Guardian reports. Another would allow half of the labor cost of repairing large appliances — fridges, ovens, dishwashers — to be claimed back on incomes taxes. That’s not all: There’s also a plan for a “chemical tax” on new computers and appliances to cover the environmental cost of those new, shiny, and often unrecyclable materials. The parliament will vote on all the proposals in December. “I believe there is a shift in view in Sweden at the moment,” Per Bolund, Sweden’s minister for financial markets and consumer affairs who spearheaded the new incentives, told the Guardian. “There is an increased knowledge that we need to make our things last longer in order to reduce materials’ consumption.” There Sweden goes again, making the rest of us look bad. read more Last week, we recommended reading literally anything that didn’t have to do with the election. This week, we’re (sort of) ready to think about why what happened … happened. In any case, it really happened.

COP22 Though this year’s U.N. climate agenda was notably less ambitious than that of the 2015 Paris meeting, climate conferences always go long. You should know that. Write it down. But there are a few notable outcomes already ironed out, even if negotiators are still scrambling on the final text: thanks obama The Obama administration took a big step in protecting the Arctic Ocean from oil and gas exploration on Friday when it blocked the sale of new permits to drill in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas off the Alaskan coast until 2022. The move was applauded by environmental groups that have long argued that drilling in the area will harm the Arctic’s fragile ecosystem and contribute to catastrophic climate change. “Given the unique and challenging Arctic environment and industry’s declining interest in the area, forgoing lease sales in the Arctic is the right path forward,” said Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell in a statement. Last year, Royal Dutch Shell and other oil companies abandoned plans to drill in the Arctic, citing the high cost of exploration as well as the falling price of oil. (Public outcry may also have had something to do with it). This step by the Obama administration, however, may not last. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to open up new lands to drilling and could ultimately reverse Obama’s decision. how crude An estimated 20 billion barrels of oil has been discovered in West Texas’s Permian Basin. This could be, according to the USGS, the largest supply of oil ever found in the United States, worth up to $900 billion. The timing could not be better for oil prospectors — and worse for the environment. President-elect Donald Trump, who thinks that climate change is a hoax, has pledged to dismantle environmental regulations and rubber stamp fossil fuel projects. There is, however, one silver lining to this discovery: The low price of oil, which is currently around $45 a barrel, means much of the Texas oil will likely remain underground, at least for the immediate future. “We are picking up a few rigs every now and then but we wont see it really take off until we get to that price in the $60 to $75 range,” said Morris Burns, former president of the Permian Basin Petroleum Association, on KWES TV. Standing Rock Mni Wiconi: The Stand at Standing Rock takes us to the scene of the standoff over the pipeline, where gathered protesters face police violence. The phrase Mni Wiconi, which means “water is life” in Lakota, has been used to rally support for the movement. The pipeline’s original route was rejected because it was a threat to Bismarck’s water supply, but it now poses that same risk to the neighboring Standing Rock Sioux. Despite recent developments that make approval for the pipeline likely, Winona LaDuke, founder of Honor the Earth, warns against despair in the short film: “Don’t operate out of fear; operate out of hope. Because with hope, everything is possible.” Vanishing Act Into the ocean, it seems. New satellite data show the total area of global sea ice dipping wayyy below the National Snow and Ice Data Center’s record for this time of year. In fact, Arctic sea ice has dropped well below the next-lowest seasonal extent ever observed (which was in 2012). That year’s all-time record low was narrowly avoided in September, the month when Arctic sea ice levels typically are at their lowest. But the fact that ice levels are lower now than they were this same time in 2012 is part of what makes this latest data so alarming. Meanwhile, Antarctic sea ice is also much lower than usual at the end of the Southern Hemisphere’s winter. Both the #Antarctic and #Arctic #seaice extents are abnormally small.

The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill. I was done with them after the first few days of the Barack Obama Presidency, but it would appear that Hillary Clinton has some roles for the President and First Lady after her coronation election.  What exactly is First Lady Michelle Obama’s legacy? Trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap? Or perhaps it will be the infamous “for the first time in my life I’m proud of my country.” I personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her “#BringBackOurGirls” sign. But why remember her when one of the Presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration? *insert mechanical applause here* But what would her role be? What is she even qualified to do? It’s not hard to figure out what Hillary Clinton wants her to do when you remember that Clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up YOUR children. If you doubt that, read this tweet:  I mean, how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children? For an additional wave of nausea, read Hillary go on and on about her “faith” and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology. Of course, Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids, as reported by The Washington Post. Back in February, she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids, either. “I do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work,” she said. “I have a rest-of-my-life horizon.” This reeks of desperation. Is Hillary trying to capture the “I don’t like Hillary, but I do like the Obamas” vote? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm, people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because, you know, racism or something. Either way, I’m absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children. The government is not one gigantic parental unit, nor should it be viewed as one. That is an extremely dangerous idea to have, as nothing good has EVER come out of complete government control over the average citizen. 
President Obama and Black Lives Matter have consistently over the past year tried to push the narrative that only black people are being unjustly persecuted because of their race. But another video released on the Internet debunks that ridiculous notion. A Black Lives Matter thug viciously attacked an innocent an unarmed woman. The footage is quite shocking. Last week two young women were savagely attacked in Stockton, California after attempting to leave a Red Robin establishment. CBS Local reported that a vigil was being held by protesters to commemorate Colby Friday. He was an African American man that had been killed by police back in August of this year.  The two girls were Caucasian and were walking past the vigil while it occurred. When they were questioned by police they said they believed the attacks were racially motivated. Because if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it’s not a pig. Assistant District Attorney Ron Freitas told the media that the attack involved several people who were from out of town and that their motivations for attending the protest and for attacking the girls had nothing to do with Colby’s death and the protests, indicating that it was racially motivated. A $10,000 reward has been placed for anyone who can provide information that will lead to the capture of these barbarians. This country is a lot less safe with these animals running around. However, unsurprisingly, the mainstream liberal media has ignored this incident and it has gone largely unreported. Because of course it does not fit into the narrative of the oppression of African-Americans. It makes Black Lives Matter look bad. In fact it makes them look racist! Which is the very thing they accuse white people of being. It also makes them the biggest hypocrites known to man. But then again, liberals have the trademark on hypocrisy. 
While Hillary Clinton’s “deplorables” comment was “inartful,” the former Meet the Press host David Gregory said that it “may have been accurate” based on surveys and anecdotal evidence. In an interview, CNN host Chris Cuomo and David Gregory were discussing how even though Trump is a racist – based on his comments of Muslims and illegal immigrants, and his “accepting” support from the KKK and David Duke – and a sexist – based on his comments in the past about women – the polls are showing a shocking level of support for him. Cuomo asked Gregory, “Does that tell you that people who know still don’t care?” Here’s how he responded: “Well, I think there’s an element of that. I mean, I don’t know that we can back that up by the data, but I do think just, look, anybody looks at a politician and says, ‘Look, I don’t agree with everything, but I still support them.’ I think there’s people who willfully ignore certain things that Trump says and focus on what they like about him. I think that’s true. “I think Hillary Clinton is in a posture — and you saw it in that answer which I thought was revealing — first of all, she wants to sidestep the fact that she did impugn a lot of Trump voters in a way that was inartful, but it may have been based — it may have been accurate in certain — based on some of the surveys that we’ve seen about attitudes of Trump supporters and other anecdotal information that we have. But, you know, her whole slogan rhetorically is we’re ‘stronger together,’ and that was not an example of that when she was in that fundraiser. “There she’s saying, ‘No, I’m going to speak out against hateful speech, about the fact that he’s a birther, that David Duke is behind him.’ I mean, I think this is her getting a little bit more aggressive. I think this is a preview of the kind of Hillary Clinton that we’ll see during aspects of these presidential debates.” I don’t doubt that some of Trump’s supporters choose not to focus on certain things that he says, but I don’t they’re “willfully ignoring” those things. Besides, even if they were “willfully ignoring” the controversial stuff that Trump has said, what about Hillary Clinton’s supporters? Are they really any different? They willfully ignore all the scandalous and criminal behavior that’s inextricably tied to their presidential choice. I agree that Trump has come across as brash, especially in the earlier part of his campaign, but actions speak louder than words. Has Trump committed the same level of crimes and been involved in the same level of corruption as the Clinton family?

Let’s just put it this way: If Donald Trump’s campaign was found guilty of this crime, the media would pre-emptively announce his resignation and carry him out of town, pitchforks and torches in hand. However, Hillary Clinton is apparently immune to any criticism in the media. Don’t know what I’m talking about? Let me fill you in. The campaign Hillary4America, a group that advocates for the policies of Hillary Clinton, was searching for recruits to go to the polls and preach the word of Clinton. Two things are wrong with this: First, it’s illegal to go to a polling/voter registration place and tell people who to vote for. It’s the reason why candidates can’t go to a polling/voter registration place and talk with voters, despite Bill Clinton doing it anyway and the media staying quiet about it. This seems like a clear cut case of voter manipulation and fraud. Second, the idiots behind Hillary4America didn’t know that one of their prospective recruits, the very people they were instructing to violate voter laws, had a hidden camera on the whole time and exposed them for the crooks they really are. Here is the entire thing, caught on tape. If this doesn’t clue you in into the mindset of people voting for Hillary, I don’t know what will.

One question on the mind of many is why would the Clinton IT staff plead the 5th? Based on this report from the NY Post, we may have part of our answer: The FBI report noted there were many hacking attempts into the system, both while Clinton was secretary of state and afterward when Platte River Networks took over the administration of the home server. The agency said none had been successful, and it never named the hackers or their points of origin. But multiple internal Platte River e-mails reviewed by The Post show that computers in China tried on three occasions in 2014 to log into Clinton’s server and a computer in Russia tried once in 2013. The internal communications also revealed how the execs belatedly tightened security on Clinton’s now-controversial home server and frantically sought to “cover our asses” when news broke that the former secretary of state’s communications were deleted. “Any chance you found an old e-mail with their directives to cut the backups back in Oct‐-Feb? . . . If we had that e-mail, we are golden,” Platte River IT consultant Bill Thornton wrote to colleagues on Aug. 19, 2015. “Wondering how we can sneak an e-mail in now after the fact asking them when they told us to cut the backups and have them confirm it for our records. Starting to think this whole thing really is covering up some shaddy s- -t.” Thornton and fellow Platte River specialist Paul Combetta refused to answer questions last week before a congressional committee probing the server scandal. Each cited his Fifth Amendment rights. Recently Judicial Watch submitted questions to Hillary Clinton that a federal judge required her to answer. That may be why crooked Hillary almost passed out on 9-11, since the date looms. Perhaps we will finally get real answers to the racketeering of The Clinton Mafia. 
Federal prosecutors began the first “Bridgegate” criminal trial by leveling their biggest accusations at New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, even though his two main deputies are the ones on trial this week. At least one known death was attributed to Bridgegate by the news media. Even though Christie isn’t a defendant in today’s court action, the stunning revelation from prosecutors means they may still see him as the ultimate target of their three year criminal investigation, as NJ.com reported: U.S. Attorney Vikas Khanna, describing the chaos of the traffic jams that paralyzed Fort Lee beginning on Sept. 9, 2013, said David Wildstein,  a former Port Authority employee who plead guilty to federal charges last year, will admit he was the one who came up with that idea. The prosecutor added that Wildstein will testify he and Baroni told Christie about the scheme at the very moment traffic was at a standstill in Fort Lee during a Sept. 11 commemoration Manhattan. “The evidence will show that Baroni and Wildstein were so committed to their plan to punish Mayor Sokolich that during those precious few minutes that they had alone with the governor, they bragged about the fact that there were traffic problems in Fort Lee and that Mayor Sokolich was not getting his calls returned. This case is about the defendants abuse of power and their callous disregard for the people of Fort Lee,” said Khanna. Last year, Trump publicly accused Christie of knowing about Bridgegate, but after the former federal prosecutor knocked out Marco Rubio in a primary debate and pledged blind fealty to the orange-faced one, the two Republicans have become nearly inseparable, no doubt brought together over a mutual love of McDonald’s. Federal prosecutors are seeking to convict Bill Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Bridget Anne Kelly, who was Governor Christie’s deputy chief of staff.  The only thing that the defense, prosecutors and all of the accused actually agree upon, is that the New Jersey Republican knew about his subordinates’ political retribution against a local mayor. In fact, defense lawyers claim that the disruptive shutdown of the George Washington Bridge connecting Fort Lee to New York City now known as BridgeGate had to be covered up to protect Christie’s now tarnished political career, because even back in 2013 he was plotting a Presidential campaign: Defense lawyers have long argued that Mr. Christie, a Republican, and his top advisers were well aware of the lane closings and that they directed the cover-up as they tried to protect the governor’s political aspirations — saying their clients were “thrown under the presidential bus,” as one lawyer argued on Monday. But this was the first time a prosecutor had pointed a finger at Mr. Christie. And it directly contradicts the governor’s statements in the three years since the lanes were mysteriously closed, paralyzing the borough of Fort Lee, N.J. As usual, the New York Times understates the forcefulness of Chris Christie’s prior defense of his blatant lies in BridgeGate. We uncovered this extraordinary video where the New Jersey Republican spent an astonishing two hours lying to the media in a televised press conference where he plainly claimed not to know anything. For years, Christie has claimed that he got away with the crime of using his public office for political purposes to harm hundreds of thousands of New York and New Jersey residents stuck in massive traffic jams caused by his irresponsible Republican administration. From the sound of federal prosecutors, it appears that they simply waited until they had every other co-conspirator so firmly within their grasp to serve Christie notice, and he’s the most likely final target of this prosecution. Watch his shame: 
While the U.S. Department of Justice temporarily halted construction of a section of the Dakota Access Pipeline, two other pipelines are moving forward. In May, the Obama administration granted the permits for both the Trans-Pecos and Comanche Trail pipelines, and while construction has not yet begun on the pipelines, implementation plans for the building of the pipelines is well underway. Earlier this week, DeSmogBlog investigative reporter Steve Horn highlighted the approval and pending construction of both pipelines, as well as their significant impact on local water supplies and indigenous territory. As Horn wrote, the Trans-Pecos pipeline will carry natural gas extracted from the Permian Basin in West Texas, and transport it across international borders to Mexico. According to the Texas Tribune, the 42-inch-wide Trans-Pecos Pipeline will carry 1.6 billion cubic feet of gas every day under the Rio Grande River. Should a leak or spill occur, the effects could be felt in both Texas and Mexico. The Comanche Trail pipeline, which is also 42-inches, will carry gas from the Waha Hub in the Northern part of Pecos County, Texas, to San Elizario, Texas, where it will then be carried across the United States/Mexico border. “[The] Trans-Pecos and Comanche go through the Big Bend area, a rural area containing mountains, desert, and ranch land. Most importantly, they link to a massive set of pipelines in Mexico that are in the process of being built and it’s a bit difficult to say what the impacts of land/spills would be there,” Horn told US Uncut. “What sorts of environmental/ecological reviews are being done in Mexico? What are the potential risks of spills there and would we even hear about them if they took place?” However, Horn says the “elephant in the room” on assessing environmental impact is the fracking being done to take natural gas out of Texas’ Permian Basin. “With temperature records being broken left and right, that’s what the conversation should really center around,” Horn said. According to the latest status report filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) earlier this month by pipeline builder Energy Transfer Partners (the company also building the Dakota Access Pipeline), construction has not yet begun. However, because the pipeline has already been granted approval by both the United States and Mexican governments, Horn says the only recourse left for activists is civil disobedience. “Dakota Access, and everything that preceded the now-ongoing civil disobedience and largest convening of Native American tribes in modern history, shows the regulatory system is designed as a corporate rubber-stamp process,” Horn said. “The courts are happy to ratify rulings based on laws written by and for Corporate America.” Horn credited the Native American tribes chaining their bodies to pipeline construction equipment in North Dakota with the Obama administration’s recent call to temporarily halt Dakota Access Pipeline construction near the Missouri River. “[Civil disobedience] might be the only option left given how much the deck is stacked in favor powerful big business interests in the US regulatory and legislative system.”

Eric Trump makes up one-half of the Trump Brothers Brain trust, a pair of imbeciles who think continuing to make mediocre business deals off of their grandfather’s inheritance and shooting endangered animals make them too cool for their own shoes. They have their father’s racism, narcissism and anus-shaped mouth. They denigrate women, are completely out of touch with reality and manage to post the dumbest things imaginable on social media. In short, they are a liberal troll’s dream. Today’s story is about Eric. He may not have been lucky enough to score his father’s name like his brother but he did manage to come into the world looking far more like Lord Cheeto than his older sibling. He has the hair and the punchable face to go with the anus mouth and nasty, spoiled brat disposition. Little Oompa Loompa took to Twitter recently and posted what I can only assume is his greatest accomplishment in life: When you are the answer to a crossword clue! #SoCool pic.twitter.com/C46tkIgROl — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) September 18, 2016  Isn’t that special? He is very, very cool, by anyone’s standards. According to this very puzzle, he ranks right up there with free wifi, pushup bras and Bozo. Though I really must admit, Bozo was pretty cool. No Trump is nearly as cool as Bozo. @EricTrump Little minds are amused so easily. — Mary Hartman (@montesgrandma) September 18, 2016  That says it all, doesn’t it? The biggest mistake little Eric made here is not offering the question that was asked.

What do you do if you’re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you’re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group? Step one should obviously be to lock your doors to make it just a little bit harder for them to break in. Step two is up to you. Do you put the pedal to the floor and power through? Do you call the police and wait. This guy had another idea entirely and it worked like a charm.  A random white guy was driving through the riots taking place in North Carolina when he was surrounded by the protesters/rioters. The photographer who witnessed the incident thought that he was going to get mugged, but for some reason they just let him through. That seems very bizarre considering that we’ve seen videos of rioters stopping cargo trucks, stealing the items within and lightening them on fire. That being the case, why would they just let one guy go? Well, they saw what he was waving out the window and they must have thought that it was in their best interest to leave him alone. While being white in the middle of an angry BLM mob would usually be a death sentence, this guy had thought ahead. When his car was surrounded, he calmly rolled down his window and let the protesters know that he had a handgun. The group quickly dispersed and let the man continue driving to his destination. This is exactly how people should handle these kinds of situations. Do you think that he did the right thing? Or should he just have driven through? 
After Colin Kaepernick knelt during the National Anthem before a football game, he became a nationally recognized name. Some people decided to burn his jersey for disrespecting our nation and some held him up as a hero of the First Amendment. And there is the owner of Krossroads Rock and Country Bar in Virginia Beach, Virginia who saw the act as disrespectful and decided to make a statement of his own. He used a Kaepernick jersey as a doormat and posted a sign on the door reminding patrons to “wipe their feet.”  One patron, James Perry, not only viewed this as inappropriate but also, wait for it, racist. The Facebook post he made is below, but he does use some foul language, so watch out for that.   The business owner said what the rest of us already know, that this was about him disrespecting our flag, not race. Just because he’s half-black doesn’t make this racist. These people are using words they don’t even understand to try to shut down free speech because they don’t like it. Perry cries about how Kaepernick was just using his First Amendment right to express his opinion, but the reality is that this bar is just doing the same thing. One of his friends mentioned that they had plans to steal the jersey from the front of the bar and another insinuated that they would give it up because they’re afraid of riots. (Because that’s a good reason to riot, you buncha’ buffoons.)  Unfortunately for these morons, that would be considered theft of private property and they could end up in prison. But something tells me that wouldn’t bother them. 
In discussing shootings and crime in the first of three presidential debates, Donald Trump not only greatly exaggerated the number of shootings in Chicago, and claimed that stop and frisk was both constitutional and effective, he also advocated taking guns away from people without due process. Of course, he thinks that the police wouldÂ take guns away from criminals, and that the Constitution is different for criminals, butÂ  has a constitutional right to due process. Doesnât matter to Trump, though: âWe have to take guns awayâ¦from bad people that shouldnât have them.â Those were Trumpâs words in the debate, where he defended stop-and-frisk as constitutional despite the fact that it was literally ruled otherwise, and has also been deemed ineffective. How the NRA can support a candidate that would take guns away from anybody at all without due process is beyond us. Thatâs especially true given the fact that this isnât the first time Trump has said this: â[Police officers are] proactive, and if they see a person possibly with a gun or they think they have a gun, they will see the person and theyâll look and theyâll take the gun away. Theyâll stop, theyâll frisk and theyâll take the gun away, and they wonât have anything to shoot with.â The 2nd Amendment cannot exist without due process. The NRA is literally supporting a candidate who would take guns away from law-abiding citizens. 
Congressional leaders and intelligence officials are investigating whether one of Donald Trump’s foreign policy “advisers” has opened up private communications with high-level members of the Russian government, some of whom are under sanction. According to multiple sources the talks have discussed the possibility that a Trump administration would lift the economic sanctions that were imposed on Russia after its unilateral annexation of Crimea in 2014, an international crime that Trump has refused to even acknowledge. The Trump adviser, Carter Page, is a former Merrill Lynch investment banker in Moscow who now runs a New York-based consulting firm, Global Energy Capital, that specializes in oil and gas deals with Russia and is located around the block from Trump’s office in New York. Page was first identified by Mr. Trump in March as a member of his “foreign policy team,” which is a motley crew of neoconservative oil men, Lebanese fascists, and imperial proconsuls from Iraq. He has since become one of Trump’s most prominent foreign policy spokesmen, although the campaign maintains that he is not officially on the bankroll. Page has extensive financial interests in Russia, notably in Gazprom, the state-run oil and gas giant, and Rosneft, the nation’s leading private oil company. He has frequently visited Moscow for meetings with high-level officials at the Kremlin and in Rosneft, and has been “a brazen apologist for anything Moscow did” according to a U.S. diplomat in Russia. Under particular scrutiny is Page’s trip to Moscow this July, when he met with Igor Sechin, a long-time Putin adviser and former deputy Prime Minister who is now the head of Rosneft and is currently under sanction by the United States government. According to numerous US officials in Moscow, Page discussed with Sechin ways to lift the American sanctions, a cause that is close to Page’s heart – and his wallet. Last March he told Bloomberg News that “so many people I work with have been adversely affected by the sanctions policy” and said that there was “a lot of excitement in terms of the possibilities for creating a better situation.” On that summer trip Page reportedly also met with Igor Devykin, the Kremlin’s deputy chief of internal policy who is believed by U.S. officials to be the official responsible for Russia’s campaign of meddling in the American election. Indeed the original impetus for investigating Page came from the Congressional investigation into Russia’s cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and on voter databases in Arizona and Illinois. While the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees have “concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election” that “could only come from senior levels of the Russian government,” Trump’s usual chauvinistic bravado has been totally absent in the face of this unprecedented meddling in American democracy by a foreign power. Indeed he has denied that Russia was even responsible. Trump’s evasiveness on the issue is part of a long pattern of scandalous pandering to the Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, from calling him a “better leader” than President Obama to promising to hand over the Baltic States to the Kremlin and going on Russian state TV to criticize American foreign policy. Trump’s traitorous appeasement of Putin, and the shocking monetary ties between his campaign and the inner circle of Russian oligarchs have already received some scrutiny – albeit far less than they should – in the American press. In Carter Page’s Moscow meetings, however, we may finally have the smoking gun implicating Trump’s campaign – or at least those close to him – in a traitorous plot with the despotic Russian government. The bombshell revelations that show Trump has received “hundreds of millions” of dollars from Russian oligarchs makes it clear why both sides would be interested in repealing the sanctions. Could Russia be plotting with Trump’s associates to influence the election in favor of the Donald, placing a Kremlin lackey in the White House who will lift sanctions in exchange for an economic windfall for his neoconservative cronies? Why else would his top foreign policy adviser promise a blacklisted Kremlin official to do what he can to end the sanctions and meet with the Russian intelligence official specifically tasked with influencing the American election?
Target garnered intense criticism for a Christmas sweater that seemingly mocked people who suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder. The store received backlash from customers who felt the sweater, which had the phrase “Obsessive Christmas Disorder” written on the front, belittled and mocked a serious mental disorder.  “As someone with OCD I’d really appreciate it if you didn’t sell my illness as a fashion statement,” Twitter user Reign Murphy tweeted alongside a photo of her holding up the sweater.   Others reacted similarly to the controversy, with several blasting the retail giant for mocking a “serious mental illness.” "Today at Target I saw a sweater that said 'OCD Obsessive Christmas Disorder'…why is trivializing a mental disorder so widely accepted?” one tweet about the sweater read. Target ultimately responded to the backlash with an apology, but stopped short of removing the item from its stores. “We never want to disappoint our guests and we apologize for any discomfort. We currently do not have plans to remove this sweater,” spokesman Josh Thomas said in the statement.  Target was previously the center of similar controversy regarding a sign that referenced “building sets” and “girls’ building sets” for sale. It was also criticized for selling a women's T-shirt with the word “Trophy” on the front, which inspired a successful petition for its removal. “The truth is that millions of women and young girls are taken as ‘trophies’ every year in war, sex trafficking, slavery, and rape,” the petition said, Fortune reported. “Labeling any person as a ‘Trophy’ is demeaning their humanity and objectifying them as a tangible object that can be bought, used, and disposed of.” Target responded to that controversy by apologizing for offending customers. “It is never our intention to offend anyone,” the company’s statement read. “These shirts are intended as a fun wink and we have received an overwhelmingly positive response from our guests.” Sources: USA Today, Fortune / Photo credit: Reign Murphy/Twitter via Spectacular Photo Wonders 
There has been a lot of speculation surrounding the shooting death of Keith Scott at the hands of Charlotte police. The police department says the shooting was justified, as Scott had a gun and threatened officers. Scott’s defenders say that he was merely waiting to pick up his children from their bus stop and was holding a book, not a gun. What is the truth? It’s still unclear, but a new revelation from Scott’s wife may shed some more light on what really happened.   The media has begun to dig into Scott’s background and found that Rakeyia Scott took out a restraining order against him, claiming that he was abusive. She also said that he had a gun and threatened to kill her. In it, she wrote, “He hit my 8 year-old in the head a total of three times with is [sic] fist… .He kicked me and threaten [sic] to kill us last night with his gun. He said he is a ‘killer’ and we should know that.”   The form also asked if there was any reason law enforcement officers should view him as a potential threat and if he carries a weapon. She answered “yes” and wrote, “He carries a 9mm black.” The order was filed October 9th, 2015 and less than two weeks later, Scott voluntarily cancelled it herself. But it certainly lends credence to the department’s claim that Scott was armed and dangerous. Police also released the dashcam and bodycam footage from the shooting, as well as photos of the handgun Scott had on him at the time. The gun was allegedly the same weapon that another homeowner reported as stolen after someone broke into their house.   And police dispute the notion that Scott was merely waiting for his children’s bus to arrive, peacefully reading a book and doing nothing wrong. They first observed him rolling a blunt, which was not a priority for them at first. But when they saw him hold up a gun, they took more notice and decided to arrest him, because the combination of drugs and guns is a threat to public safety. The officers, who were originally in plain clothes, outfitted themselves with marked duty vests and equipment so it would be clear they were police officers, and gave Scott multiple commands to drop the gun. He refused. Scott’s DNA and fingerprints were found on the gun, which was loaded. So again, we have another case of the Black Lives Matter movement exploiting a justified police shooting and using it to spawn riots and violence in the name of “justice.” 
You can’t make this stuff up. We live in an age where there’s an Islamist attack – and the media rushes to make sure that Muslims are OK. The very same people who are all too happy to call for gun control and demonize law abiding gun owners following a mass shooting will do everything they can to protect the sensibilities of Muslims following an Islamist attack. Yes, guns are misused, and Islam has its radicals, but radical Islam is much more damaging than guns ever could be. According to the Pew Research Center, roughly 10 percent of Muslims globally hold what we would deem “extremist” views (those who would condone violence against non-Muslims). If ten percent of gun owners were “extremists,” there wouldn’t be any people left! On Saturday there were two bombings, one in NJ and another in NY. Today we found out that the killer was a radical Muslim (shocking!). Another stabbing attack was carried out in Minnessota – whereas nine were injured but none killed. The attacker was shot to death by an off-duty police officer. Now police are warning about attacks…… against Muslims. As the Gateway Pundit reported: On Saturday Islamist Dahir Adan went on a stabbing rampage at Crossroads Mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota. Adan was screaming, “Allahu Akbar!” during the attack. ISIS claimed responsibility for the St. Cloud knife attack. BREAKING: Islamic State’s Amaq news posts claim of responsibility for #MinnesotaMall stabbing attack #StCloud pic.twitter.com/J8Y7pFCALn — Lisa Daftari (@LisaDaftari) September 18, 2016  Dahir Adan was born in Somalia. After the attack Police Chief Wm. Blair Anderson Issued a warning…. to watch out for reprisal attacks. Perhaps they should be on the lookout for other attacks against innocent Americans by crazed Islamists so they can be thwarted like the one in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where, just this morning, multiple bombs were found at a rail station. Had the bombs not been discovered, they could have detonated during the Monday morning commute, injuring thousands.   
The rampant corruption and fraud has gotten so widespread in our government and electoral system that the politicians don’t even try to hide it anymore. It’s massive and we just let it happen. I don’t support either candidate this time around, so I have nothing to lose (except my country and the Constitution) in this horse race. But it looks to me like the electoral tide favors Trump. With Hillary’s health and ever increasing stack of scandals, Trump seems to be the only alternative and that just pisses Obama off. At a minimum, about 15% of illegal immigrants will vote in this election. It will probably be much higher in those states where they have relaxed or negated voter ID laws. The illegal immigrants they ‘accidentally’ gave citizenship to were no accident. This is part and parcel of their plan to terraform the voting demographic across the nation. Many of the refugees they are bringing in will also vote illegally. I’m sure they have been instructed to. This is about power and control for the Marxists.  From Fox News: An internal Obama administration email shows immigration officials may be literally working overtime to swear in as many new “citizen voters” as possible before the Nov. 8 presidential election, a powerful lawmaker charged Thursday. The email, from a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services field office chief and part of a chain of correspondence within the agency, urges the unnamed recipient to swear in as many citizens as possible “due to the election year.” “The Field Office due to the election year needs to process as many of their N-400 cases as possible between now and FY 2016,” reads the email, which was disclosed to FoxNews.com by Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who chairs the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. “If you have cases in this category or other pending, you are encouraged to take advantage of the OT if you can,” the email continues. “This will be an opportunity to move your pending naturalization cases. If you have not volunteered for OT, please consider and let me know if you are interested.” Parts of the email were redacted before it was disclosed to FoxNews.com, but it was sent by the branch chief of the Houston Field Office District 17. It was not clear to whom it was addressed. It’s not just the illegal and refugee vote either… the Democrats have started a huge push overseas to get Americans abroad to vote. Approximately 85% of them usually don’t, but that may change this year. They are actively being contacted and urged to vote for Hillary Clinton. Then you have the voting machines themselves out of Venezuela which I contend are manipulated for votes as well. Once again, you will see people bused in to vote at locations which is also not legal or ethical. Americans are going to have to rise up at some point and stop this. We are no longer a free voting Republic… we now exist under the illusion of freedom, when in fact our elections are rigged and it matters not what or who we vote for. The email above shows how the Democrats are illegally padding the voter roles. There is literally nothing they won’t do to win this time around. And they don’t care who knows it. They think they are above the law now and no one will stop them. Maybe they are right.  
Scroll down for video There’s little doubt that this campaign season has been anything but civil, the issues of immigration, national security, terrorism and the economy have all taken a toll on America’s psyche, and whether we like it or not, we’ve all collectively witnessed our institutions slowly fall into disrepair by corruption, greed and malfeasance, by those individuals who have sworn under oath to defend and preserve those same institutions. And while the political elites attempt to bring down Trump, they forget or attempt to distract the public, that they are the political class, and are directly responsible for America’s decline, and aside from the phony who currently resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, there’s another phony, in one Hillary Clinton, who has been a career politician for decades, and who now claims to be an outsider, regardless of the fact that she and Bill Clinton have amassed a huge fortune. Perhaps this 3-minute video clip best illustrates how these two career politicians have used the system to enrich themselves by creating perhaps the largest criminal enterprise within American politics, known as the “Clinton Foundation” which promotes itself as a worldwide outreach charitable organization, while at the same time a financial slush fund for these two. Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, sold access to anyone and everyone with an open checkbook, while Bill used her influence to enrich himself with blotted speaking fees to those same countries donating vast sums of money to the foundation, by selling America down the drain to the highest bidder.  Do you think Hillary being involved in so many instances of lying and scandals should disqualify her as President?

Trump supporters not only come in all shapes, colors, and sizes, they come from all around, even outside the United States. At Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta – that’s in Canada for those of our readers who are Gary Johnson supporters…(just kidding!) – student Matt Linder was wearing a red Trump hat with the campaign’s slogan “Make America Great Again” on the front. Even though they’re Canadian, he and his friend both happen to be very interested in American politics, and are both supporters of Donald Trump. But other students felt their safe space severely violated by this red hat, with one Zoe Slusar demanding that he remove it, because “it’s hate language on campus.” Heat Street reported on the incident: “You’re not allowed to share hate language at a University,” Slusar shouted at Linder. “Make America Great Again means Make America all for white people, no immigrants, no people of different sexual orientations. “You’ve got to take the hat off or I am going to write the president of the University,” she continues. “It’s not allowed. It’s hate language on campus.” The video ends when another man (presumably a student) snatches the hat from Linder’s head and absconds with it. Slusar left this description on her Facebook page, but it has since been deleted: Today I got into an altercation with a guy wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat. I went up and asked him if he would take the hat off, explaining a university should be a safe space. It was impossible to communicate to him why wearing a hat in support of a movement grown on the seeds of racism, bigotry and exclusion of diversity (sexual and cultural) could make some people afraid. People came out of the woodwork around us to support the hat, and after insulting me, they began filming my “crazy” behaviour at asking him to not wear the hat on campus. The video was posted and I made the mistake of reading the comments. I am so deeply saddened… I don’t want to draw anymore attention to the dysfunctional pawns that are being used by a system of power to oppress others. I do want to state that I stand by my belief that every space, but especially university spaces, should be made to make everyone feel SAFE. We need to seriously change our culture. We need to equally support and express movements and gestures of inclusive acceptance. I walked outside after the altercation, which ended up involving security and more concern for someone’s “private property” then about anti-oppression and overt racism, feeling totally hopeless. Only to find the anti-abortion group posing with their graphic images and slogans of “sin”. But… Beside them was a group of courageous and beautiful humans, holding signs of “we support your choice” and kindly warning oncoming students about the graphic images so they could be avoided. (Thank you Aalayna Spence, Nathan Lawley and crew.) It makes me cry that there will always be battles of “right” and “wrong”… There will always be opposing parties… Unfortunately for many people life does not exist without fear of oppression, violence or attack. But there are some warriors, who are not too tired. Some humans who want anyone being attacked (be it blatant or subtle) to know they are equally being a supported. I’m ready to make some noise YYC. I’m ready for some LOUD AF language of LOVE. That is the only thing that might have a chance of helping the world. So be a warrior and express your support for those who are attacked everyday because of who they are. #peace She seems to be a walking contradiction. She wants everyone to “be a warrior and express your support for those who are attacked everyday because of who they are.” But that’s exactly what she did to the Trump supporter student. She attacked him, because of who he was. And not only that, she attacked him based on stereotypes created by the media of Trump and his supporters.

Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s camp requested to have the most embarrassing piece of equipment to help her stand tall against Donald Trump during the debate on Monday — a step stool so that she would not be dwarfed by Republican rival Donald Trump’s 6’2″ frame. Hillary, standing at only 5’4″, was apparently worried that she would look short and weak standing next to the Republican presidential nominee, but the commission for the debate basically said tough luck as the rejected her request. Instead, according to the Drudge Report, they will be making a custom podium that will help accommodate for the differences in height. But wait, there’s more! Hillary’s camp also reportedly questioned whether there would be any commercial breaks during the 90-minute showdown. The answer was a resounding no. In fact, Debate moderator Lester Holt does not even have the authority to cut away from the stage during the debate — even if Hillary faints or has another coughing spell. It was also noted that microphone audio for both Trump and Clinton was not to be manipulated, so everything will be out in the open — warts and all. Can Hillary Clinton make it through another speaking engagement, this time actually having to stand up against Trump, without having her health interfere? Monday’s debate was reportedly expected to draw 100 million viewers, which would make it the biggest political event in history. If Team Hillary can’t rise to the task, it could spell doom for her campaign. Hillary Clinton recently had a 4-minute coughing fit at an rally stop in Ohio, for example. If something like that happens, or worse — she looses her footing for any reason — that could seriously be the end for her. Monday’s debate is sure shaping up to be quite the show.

Hollywood loses yet another one of their dearest actresses, and we are heartbroken. She was born in Chicago Illinois on December 27, 1942 and loved by anyone and everyone who came in contact with her. Many of you probably remember the legendary actress as Liesl Von Trapp from “The Sound of Music.” Charmian Carr definitely left an imprint on Hollywood, and she will never be forgotten. TMZ reported the death of the 73-year-old on Sunday September 18, 2016. Carr’s rep stated that she died from complications from dementia. Apparently she was battling a rare form of the disease.  Carr’s story was a very unique one, which makes her acting journey so special. At the time that she auditioned for “The Sound of Music” she was a student at the San Fernando Valley State College. She was studying speech therapy and philosophy, and was also working for a doctor. “I was going to college and getting extra spending money by modeling in fashion shows in one of the stores. One of the girls who modeled with me knew that Robert Wise, producer-director of The Sound of Music had been conducting a four-month search for someone to play the part of 16-year-old Liesl. My friend, without my knowing it, sent in my picture and explained in a note that I sang and danced. I received a call from Mr. Wise to come for a tryout. It took me completely by surprise…”  After completing “The Sound of Music” and several other acting parts, Carr left her career in acting and pursued another life-long dream of hers. Charmian started her own interior design business “Charmian Carr Designs” and surprisingly it took off a lot easier than she expected – especially after being hired by Michael Jackson. Carr married Jay Brent who was a dentist in 1967 and 24 years later the couple got a divorce. They had two beautiful daughters together. She is survived by all of her siblings, her daughters and her grandchildren.  She brought joy to everyone around her and even still today she is known and loved by those who watch her shows. Her smile lit up every room she walked into and her positive personality was contagious. Please continue to keep this family in your prayers as they mourn the loss of their loved one. I can’t help but watch this over and over and think that there will never be anyone who could replace this woman!  RIP CHARMIAN CARR.
Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton knows her facts, and during tonight’s debate she busted Trump for his ludicrous tweet calling climate change a hoax by the Chinese. While it’s true that China is a major coal user, America still relies on tons of the dirty stuff, so we’re all in this together. When Hillary Clinton first slammed Trump’s non-scientific pseudo nonsense, so Politifact rated it as “mostly true”: Trump has repeatedly called climate change a “hoax” in speeches, tweets and media appearances, and while he hasn’t necessarily repeated the charge that China “invented” climate change, he has said as recently as Jan. 18, 2016, that action on climate change “is done for the benefit of China.”  He also referred to it with a profanity. Give me clean, beautiful and healthy air – not the same old climate change (global warming) bullshit! I am tired of hearing this nonsense. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2014  Climate change is the number one existential fight that not only America faces, but that the world faces. Tonight, it only rated a single mention, and only because the Republican Party has been living in an alternate universe like the Trump Train on this issue for years, while seas are rising and the planet warms. It’s just another reason to vote Blue in November, if you care about the planet and our species’ continued survival. Hillary called out Trump for his madness. He lied. Trump DID call #ClimateChange a Chinese hoax!https://t.co/LxBegp2iWl#debatenight — Grant Stern (@grantstern) September 27, 2016 
A Sergeant employed by the Dallas Police Department has officially filed a lawsuit in federal court against the notorious Black Lives Matter group for allegedly inciting anti police violence. The Sergeant is Demetrick Pennie whose the President of the Dallas Fallen Officer Foundation. He’s worked in law enforcement for seventeen years. Quite an impressive resume. In his lawsuit he said, “police officers and other law enforcement persons of all races and ethnicities including but not limited to Jews, Christians and Caucasians.” Defendants in the case include other race baiters such as Al Sharpton, President Obama, Hillary Clinton, Louis Farrakhan, George Soros, and The New Black Panthers Party. Pennie reports that they have, “repeatedly incited their supporters and others to engage in threats of and attacks to cause serious bodily injury or death upon police officers and other law enforcement persons of all races and ethnicities.” Furthermore, the lawsuit contends that the defendants have encouraged their supporters and citizens, “to engage in threats and attacks” against law enforcement officers around the country, including the July 7 murders of five Dallas police officers by Micah Johnson after a Black Lives Matter demonstration.” Larry Klayman who is a renowned conservative lawyer of FreedomWatch is representing Pennie in his case. Klayman told reporters in a press release, “Sergeant Pennie and I feel duty-bound to put ourselves forward to seek an end to the incitement of violence against law enforcement which has already resulted in the death of five police officers in Dallas and the wounding of seven more, just in Texas alone.” The lawsuit spans 66-pages and seeks a whopping $500 million in compensatory damages. Now while that number is completely ludicrous and next to impossible to obtain Pennie and Klayman are likely to obtain some portion of that number. This is a copy of the lawsuit. Pennie v. Soros et al Amended Complaint by BreitbartTexas on Scribd  Sgt. Pennie told Breitbart news why he felt the need to bring about this lawsuit and spoke about his motives saying, “This action was brought to stop the violence and killings of law enforcement officers in Dallas and throughout the nation.” You guys certainly have our prayers that you get compensation for all the pain and suffering good cops have had to deal with over the last few years. 
It’s the nightmare scenario we hope doesn’t happen: On November 8, somewhere around midnight or shortly thereafter, the election returns are finally in from across the nation and it becomes clear that Donald J. Trump is the next President of the United States. But instead of reaching for your passport and booking an extended vacation to another country, consider what University of Utah law professor Christopher L. Peterson had to say in a paper he just published: Even if he were elected, there’s enough evidence already in the matter of Trump University to impeach the Orange Menace before he even raises his hand and takes the oath of office. Peterson writes: “In the United States, it is illegal for businesses to use false statements to convince consumers to purchase their services. The evidence indicates that Trump University used a systemic pattern of fraudulent representations to trick thousands of families into investing in a program that can be argued was a sham. “Fraud and racketeering are serious crimes that legally rise to the level of impeachable acts.”   In the paper, which is titled Trump University and Presidential Impeachment, Professor Peterson also notes: “Somehow in the cacophony of the 2016 presidential campaign, no legal academic has yet turned to the question of whether Trump’s alleged behavior would, if proven, rise to the level of impeachable offenses under the impeachment clause of the United States Constitution.” So instead of taking up residence at the White House, Trump could instead be facing a trial in the Senate and another in federal court which could well wind up result in him having to pay back tens of millions of dollars to the very people he cheated with his bogus university. And if he were found guilty of racketeering, Trump could even be sent to federal prison where he belongs. Hey, Donald: Don’t get too excited on election night. It may turn out to the beginning of the end for you. Featured Image Via Flickr available under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic License
An allegedly unarmed, mentally disabled black man having a seizure was shot by police Tuesday afternoon. The shooting happened minutes after his sister called 911 for medical assistance. Police in El Cajon, California — outside of San Diego — tweeted on Tuesday afternoon that officers had an encounter with an “erratic subject” that ended with officers shooting the man, later identified as Alfred Olango. Black Lives Matter organizer Johnetta Elzie tweeted that Olango died from his wounds. Officers responded to an erratic subject that ended with an officer involved shooting. We will post updates here as they are available. — El Cajon Police (@elcajonpolice) September 27, 2016  Being told there's been a fatal police shooting in San Diego. #AlfredOlango is the name. Have a friend there at the scene. — Johnetta Elzie (@Nettaaaaaaaa) September 28, 2016  In a Facebook Live video, streamer Rumbie Mubaiwa talked to Olango’s sister, who said her brother was 30 years old. Olango was allegedly having a seizure, and his sister called 911 for medical assistance. Minutes after police arrived, Olango had been shot. “I called for help, I didn’t call for you guys to kill him,” the woman screamed at police while sobbing uncontrollably. “Oh my god, you killed my brother!” “I should have called the crisis communications team,” the woman said.  In a Periscope filmed at the scene of the shooting by NBC 7 reporter Ashley Matthews, at least two witnesses to the shooting said Olango was shot with his hands oustretched, and was unarmed. “I see a man, I see a black man surrounded by officers with their guns out, which caught my attention,” a witness said, stretching out his hands to demonstrate. “The black male is up with his hands like this, scared to death, not knowing which way he’s gonna go … as soon as he runs this way, they discharge. Boom, boom, boom five shots right into him.” Watch on #Periscope: Untitled https://t.co/rrMukk0J79 — Ashley Matthews (@ashleyNBC7) September 27, 2016  According to NBC 7, police confiscated the cell phones of employees at a local restaurant near the scene of the shooting, and told employees to not talk to anyone. The American Civil Liberties Union of San Diego issued a public statement condemning the confiscation of witnesses’ phones. “Confiscating cell phones is a violation of the Fourth Amendment (unreasonable seizure without warrant or exigent circumstance) and the First Amendment (interference with the right to record in public) under the U.S. Constitution and analogous rights under the California Constitution,” stated ACLU of San Diego executive director Norma Chavez-Peterson. “It is hard to see any kind of Fourth Amendment exigent circumstances at issue here.” However, the police department tweeted that no phones were confiscated. We ask that the community please be careful about reacting to inaccurate information. No phones were confiscated from anyone at the scene. — El Cajon Police (@elcajonpolice) September 28, 2016  One employee who recorded video of the shooting on her phone turned the video over to police. El Cajon Police told local media they are currently reviewing the video as part of the investigation. In a tweet, the police department said that the video does not show Olango raising his hands in the air before he was shot. El Cajon police are not currently equipped with body cameras. The investigation just started, but based on the video voluntarily provided by a witness, the subject did NOT have his hands up in the air — El Cajon Police (@elcajonpolice) September 28, 2016  The name of the officer who shot Olango is currently being withheld.   (EDITOR’S NOTE: This story was updated at 11:30 PM Eastern Time to note that Olango had died in the hospital, and to include tweets from the El Cajon Police Department alleging that Olango’s hands were not in the air, and that no phones were confiscated at the scene. This article was also amended to include a statement from the ACLU of San Diego.)        
In a second night of violent protests in Charlotte, North Carolina after a black police officer shot and killed an armed, black suspect, Keith Lamont Scott, things are spiraling out of control and the governor has declared an emergency there. One protester is clinging to life by a thread after being critically wounded by a protester who shot into the crowd randomly. He was hit in the head and is on life support. Three other protesters and four officers were wounded in the chaos. I even heard that protesters tried to throw a reporter into a fire. I also saw white people in their cars with guns for protection. I can’t say that I blame them. The NASCAR Hall of Fame and many other businesses were hit by vandals during all of this. The National Guard has now arrived to help fight the increasing violence in Charlotte.  From the Daily Mail: National Guard troops have arrived in Charlotte after a protest turned violent on Wednesday night. A state of emergency has been declared in response to the chaos that has taken over the North Carolina city, two days after a father-of-seven was shot dead by a police officer. One of the demonstrators was shot in the head outside the Omni Hotel and is fighting for his life. At least three other protesters and four police officers were also taken to hospital after they were injured in the riot. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV were also attacked while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast. It was the second night of unrest following the deadly shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by black cop, Brentley Vinson, on Tuesday afternoon. Police insist he was armed, but family members maintain he was only reading a book when he was gunned down next to his car. Many businesses and buildings, including the NASCAR Hall of Fame, were hit by vandals and looters. Major companies with offices in the downtown area – including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Duke Energy – all told employees to stay away from the area Thursday. Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts is considering putting a curfew in place in a bid to control the disorder. A number of black people defended the police officers, but there were far more that wanted to get their violence on there. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV was attacked, while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast. On Thursday morning, hotel and restaurant employees and security guards started cleaning up dozens of broken windows after protesters smashed buildings and painted the slogan ‘Black Lives Matter’ on walls. Demonstrators were also seen breaking into a convenience store and a shop that sells merchandise for the NBA franchise, the Charlotte Hornets. Others set fire to trash cans. Some protesters expressed anger at the lawlessness exhibited by fellow demonstrators. One woman was heard shouting, “Stop – that’s not what this is about,” as young men broke bottles in the street. After a black man shot another protester, demonstrators began throwing bottles, dirt clods and fireworks at the officers. The police fired flash grenades and then tear gas back, dispersing the crowd of several hundred. Protesters responded by hurling trash cans and potted plants. A riot is an uncontrollable beast… once you unleash it, it takes on a life of its own and the message is usually lost in the violence and chaos that ensues. I fear this is another step in a race war and all out chaos in our streets. Russia must be smiling.                         
One brave police chief in Ohio is speaking out over the killing of Terence Crutcher by police in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In two tweets, Rodney Muterspaw — police chief of Middletown, Ohio, just outside of Cincinnati — sharply criticized his fellow police officers in response to the killing of 40-year-old father of four Terence Crutcher, who was killed shortly after his SUV broke down on the way home from a community college class. Without mentioning the officer by name, Muterspaw said officers who killed without exhausting all other options were “making [law enforcement] look bad.” As an officer I am so sick and drained of some cops doing things like this. You are making us all look bad. STOP. #TerenceCruthcher — R_Muterspaw (@RodneyMute) September 20, 2016  Muterspaw added that he was “sick of seeing death and hate” and implored his colleagues in law enforcement to embrace “compassion and empathy.” Life is precious man. Sorry we don't all agree. Compassion and empathy is eternally important. Just sick of seeing death & hate. #Life — R_Muterspaw (@RodneyMute) September 20, 2016  The tweets garnered dozens of responses from Muterspaw’s followers, nearly all of whom gave the standard pro-police lines of argument often heard after the killing of a civilian by law enforcement. Muterspaw unflinchingly defended his words, saying he had been in similar situations before, and that the top priority was to “protect life first.” @godisgood1961 Been on that type of call/situation over 100x. You don't shoot for non-compliance. You shoot when UOF escalates. Not hard. — R_Muterspaw (@RodneyMute) September 20, 2016  @EASTBAYDFRESH @askarsismygod been in that situation 100x….communication, taser, pepper spray…whatever it takes to protect life first — R_Muterspaw (@RodneyMute) September 20, 2016  The killing of Terence Crutcher ignited outrage on social media after video of the shooting was released earlier this week. In the video, Crutcher is seen standing by his disabled vehicle with his hands up, while a slew of officers approach him with guns drawn. As Crutcher walks to his driver side window, the officers used tasers and opened fire, believing he was reaching for a weapon. However, no gun was found at the scene of Crutcher’s slaying. In the helicopter footage, an officer is heard saying, “He looks like a bad dude. Probably on something.” Officer Betty Shelby, who fired the shot that killed Crutcher, is on paid administrative leave. Calls to Jason Pappas, president of the Fraternal Order of Police’s Local 9 lodge in Ohio, were not immediately returned.        
On Monday, Congressman Lee Zeldin (R-NY) took to Twitter to use the apprehension of lead suspect in the NYC bombing investigation, Ahmad Khan Rahami, to take a shot at San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in an exceptionally clumsy attempt to connect his police recent brutality protests with terrorism, writing “You are welcome” after noting that Rahami was taken into custody:  Zeldin obviously thought the tweet would give him the final say in the matter and a chance to say he thought Kaepernick was ungrateful, but the Internet had other plans. After firing off his passive aggressive swipe at  the football player, Twitter would declare open season on him and continue to to roast him after declaring his ridiculous comment the new, “Thanks, Obama.”  Like “Thanks, Obama” in which Democrats mocked how Republicans went out of their way to link extremely remote events as outcomes of President Obama’s presidency, “You’re welcome, Kaepernick” could now be used to illustrate how absurdly far the right would stretch to manufacture a situation Colin Kaepernick should be grateful for.   The tweet made it to several verified accounts, most notably reaching host of Matter of Fact TV’s Soledad O’Brien. All in all, we can probably guess this is not how Congressman Zeldin planned on this tweet working out for him. Lets hope this bully learns his humiliating lesson, and stop trying to exploit a national scare to increase his national profile.   
Our Constitution protects the right of people to disrespect this nation. It’s despicable, but such policies help preserve the very foundation of freedom in America.   However, nowhere in the Constitution does it say that every action and speech is protected against consequences. Though one may not be jailed for speaking, that doesn’t mean that employers cannot dictate what speech is acceptable in the workplace. As such, one history teacher who disrespected America has discovered that while his actions did not land him in jail, he has landed in hot water. A teacher on Monday at Massey Hill Classical High School in Fayetteville, North Carolina – home of Fort Bragg and America’s Special Forces – stomped on the flag to prove a point about the value of the First Amendment. Because of this, the teacher has been placed on administrative leave while the school district investigates the incident. Students reported that the teacher had attempted to burn and tear the flag before stomping on it. Several students were upset and some walked out in protest of the disgrace. “I put it on the ground and I used my right foot and I took two steps on it, and immediately two kids get out of the room,” the teacher, Lee Francis, stated. Francis was teaching about the First Amendment and specifically about Texas V. Johnson, a Supreme Court case that struck-down prohibitions on flag desecration. “But this is exactly what I teach: You don’t teach kids how to think or what to think; you teach them to go their own path,” Francis said. “If they feel so convicted that this is their cause they’re going to stand for, I don’t blame them. It’s an upper-level school for those who aspire to go to college and in that regard, we have rigor and expectations, so I treat them as such.” “Not only was the demonstration warranted and justified based on the court, it’s warranted and justified in the rights we have,” he continued. This is the law of the land upheld by the highest court. Freedom of speech is not just defined verbally by something you say or write down on paper, but something that can also be a physical action.” The school district has placed him on paid administrative leave as they investigate. What Francis’ explanation reveals, however, is that he remains ignorant about the world he lives in. Just because something is legal does not mean that it is a good idea and it doesn’t mean that the legal act is not deeply offensive to some or downright inappropriate. If Francis wished to teach about Texas v. Johnson, he should have done so the way countless other teachers have done: by explaining it. Acting-out the provocative action is not necessary and unnecessarily hurtful to members of the fiercely-patriotic Fayetteville community. Unfortunately, “paid administrative leave” sounds an awful like “union-sponsored paid vacation.” 
Maybe Clinton was actually thinking of Mark Cuban, her guest “star” for her debate against Trump. Here is a video of Cuban explaining racism. Actually he ends up showcasing his own racism.  Liberals talk of tolerance and not seeing color, as they showcase their intolerance and ability to see “black” quite easily. As a Conservative and Republican, I live in the real world, where I deal with statistics. The math around black teen criminality would make me a fool not to cross the street when I see black teens. Liberals suspend reality, because they must in order to rationalize their nonsense. However, in suspending reality, they are not allowed to then take the “conservative” position of facts, logic, and reason…when convenient. That is why Mark Cuban is a racist. But it may be worse. Apparently Cuban is a bit of a sexist. .@HillaryClinton surrogate, @mcuban, w/ two women, pulling one woman's hair as he shows what appears to be his penis. #debates #debates2016 pic.twitter.com/11ExLaUtHd — Microchip (@WDFx2EU7) September 25, 2016  Judge for yourself. 
Milwaukee Country Sheriff David Clarke told Neil Cavuto of FOX News that the behavior of the rioters in Charlotte, North Carolina on Tuesday night, riots which resulted in the injury of at least a dozen police officers trying to stop the mayhem and anarchy, was “primitive” and “subhuman” and resembled the kind of reaction you’d typically see in a “third-world nation.” After Cavuto pointed out that major news headlines in the Democrat Media Complex, ranging from the Washington Post to the New York Times, conveniently left out the fact that Keith Lamont Scott, the black man shot by a black police officer, was armed and refused to drop his weapon, according to police, Sheriff Clarke, as is always the case, did not mince words in describing both the media malpractice as well as the rioters’ behavior. “It was done on purpose [the media leaving out that Keith Lamont Scott had a gun] to stoke up anger and resentment by the liberal mainstream media,” Sheriff Clarke asserted. “Look, what was on display last night was something was something that resembled something you’d see in third-world nations like Haiti. This doesn’t represent the good city of Charlotte, North Carolina in the United States. You saw primitive behavior on display — at best primitive behavior — and at worst subhuman as people just reacted to circumstances.” “It’s not a socially acceptable response to people’s frustration and what they may not know,” Sheriff Clarke assessed.

It would be foolish to pretend that all police officers are upstanding professionals. Just like any profession, there are many, many dedicated professionals and yes, there are some bad ones as well. Police officers are people and sometimes they make mistakes and sometimes they’re just plain bad people of low moral character.   However, in a profession that requires people to literally put their lives on the line for the good of society, I feel comfortable asserting that while there are some bad apples to be found, the vast, vast majority of police officers in America are dedicated professionals worthy of respect and who should be offered a degree of freedom from unnecessarily second-guessing life-and-death decisions that must occur in a millisecond. But don’t tell that to the Congressional Black Caucus… The caucus is demanding that radicalized and openly-corrupted Attorney General Loretta Lynch step in to target police officers to help prevent officers throughout the country from reacting with deadly force to black men and women who pose immediate dangers. Of course, the caucus does not frame the discussion in exactly that way, but that is the effort all the same. Referring to recent high-profile killings of armed black men posing immediate dangers to police officers, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-CA, read the letter to the Attorney General outside the Department of Justice as the adoring media dutifully nodded in agreement. “The world is watching and we cannot continue to ignore these killings,” she grandstanded with the caucus standing in solidarity. The letter urges Lynch to “aggressively pursue investigations, indictments and prosecutions through the Office of Civil Rights against any and all law enforcement officers who harm or kill innocent unarmed black men, women and children.” Of course, such a demand seems reasonable… if they’re truly innocent people. However, in many recent high-profile cases of blacks being killed by officers of varying ethnicities, the quickly-fabricated narrative concerning the conduct of the deceased radically differs from the reality of the situation that emerges after radicalized social justice warriors have already furthered a fictitious narrative that supports their manipulative media narrative. 
Obama’s time as president is almost over and millions of Americans are counting down the days until he vacates the Oval Office. He promised before taking office that he would fundamentally change America and he did… for the worse. It’s hard to believe that his legacy will be remembered fondly once he’s left office, considering that virtually everything he has implemented has been a miserable failure. But that hasn’t stopped him from patting himself on the back anyway — and telling Americans that they need to protect his legacy once he’s left office. In a speech to the Congressional Black Caucus on Saturday night, Obama used Jim Crow laws and slavery in an effort to encourage people to vote for the “right” candidate. He told the people assembled that his legacy was at stake, so they needed to give him a good send off by registering people to vote. And those people, of course, need to vote for Hillary Clinton.   While Obama did not mention Hillary by name, he said it would be an insult to him if the black community does not support her. “My name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot,” he said. “And there is one candidate who will advance those things. And there is another candidate who’s defining principal, the central theme of his candidacy is opposition to all that we have done.” He then cited the historic turnout among the African-American community in 2008 and 2012, saying, “I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy, if this community lets down it’s guard and fails to activate itself in this election. You want to give me a good send off? Go vote!”   Of course, history contradicts everything that Obama said. It was Democrats, not Republicans, that supported slavery, segregation and Jim Crow laws. The Republican Party was formed specifically to end slavery. The original Congressional Black Caucus were the first black members of Congress… and they were Republicans. Democrats came up with the Ku Klux Klan in order to prevent black Americans from voting. Meanwhile, Obama’s actual legacy with the black community isn’t exactly stellar. It was the Obama administration that cancelled D.C.’s school voucher program, so that low-income minority children could not go to expensive private schools, like the one Obama’s children got to attend. And under Obama’s leadership, unemployment and food stamp usage have skyrocketed, hitting the black community harder than any other. He’s done nothing about the destruction of the black family, the disproportionately high number of black babies aborted every year, or the fact that almost 76% of black children are born out of wedlock. And he wants to brag about his legacy? Is he out of his mind? 
Donald Trump’s charity non-profit Trump Foundation does not exist for its stated purpose of helping those in need, unless one believes Trump himself is among the needy. Yes, Trump was so desperately in need he used the Trump Foundation’s funds to purchase himself a lunch with a Hollywood actress. In 2008, Trump was a guest at a Gucci charity auction where he had an opportunity to bid on something he found too irresistible to pass up: a trip to France which included lunch with Salma Hayek which would take place in the husband of Hayek billionaire François-Henri Pinault’s vineyard. Comedian Chris Rock was hosting the auction and said the auction included “Salma Hayek and her breasts“, which was like blood in the water for Trump. He feverishly bid on the potential meeting all the way up to the tune of $120,000 of the Trump Foundation’s money. Surely a ritzy meal in a billionaire’s vineyard was the best way for Trump to help the needy. Trump bidding on the auction trip with the foundation’s money very likely violated a non-profit law which prohibits “self-dealing” as 501c3 organizations are required to disclose any use of money to purchase gifts for an organization’s executives. Trump’s campaign says he did not personally take the trip, but could also not offer an elaboration as to who did actually take the trip to France. Even if Trump had given the trip to a family member, he would still be in violation. For her part Hayek, while a guest on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on March 30, 2016, said she and Trump have known each other for many years but did not state when they first met. She went on to call Trump’s politics “madness” and wondered why so many individuals are supporting him.  In later media appearances, Hayak was not nearly as charitable about Donald Trump. While a guest on “The Late Late Show With James Corden” on August 4, 2016 Hayak said of Trump, “We have a first-grade boy running for President of the United States.”  Hayek has not been quiet about Trump ‘s hateful rhetoric but she gave him points for showing the world racism still exists. While being interviewed on “America with Jorge Ramos” on August 6, 2016 Hayak said, “The good thing about what Trump did is that it’s shown a light to the level of the problem of racism.”  It is safe to say that during their years of knowing one another Hayek has had enough of Trump’s sub-human personality, and if the two were to meet and converse in the future it would be a terse conversation.
The first debate showdown of Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was expected to be a brutal altercation between the two candidates. Instead, the viewing audience was treated to a one-sided destruction with Clinton appearing cool and presidential, while Trump gave the worst debate performance in presidential history. Each candidate had the ability to invite guests for moral support, and Clinton invited billionaire Mark Cuban who has been one of the loudest voices against Trump in the media. There is no love lost between the two businessmen, and Cuban even said of Trump there was “no bigger jagoff in the world.” The indebted businessman happily admitted on stage in front of Cuban to being in debt at least $600 million. The shameless Trump, who became more unhinged as the night progressed, freely gave away one of his biggest secrets — that he does not and has not paid any federal taxes in years. Clinton speculated about this, and like a predictable rube under the hot lights Trump cracked under the pressure. Rather than offer an explanation or deflection to Clinton’s hypothesis Trump agreed he paid no taxes and said, “That makes me smart.” Trump’s cheap explanation sounded like something a third grader on the playground would offer rather than a presidential candidate. An hour after the debate Trump immediately began walking back his statement, and denied he had ever said it. This type of shamelessness is difficult to combat. When asked , “It sounds like you admitted you haven’t paid federal taxes and that was smart. Is that what you meant to say?” Trump replied, “No, I didn’t say that at all.” Trump insulted every American who pays their fair share of taxes and Cuban was not amused nor impressed. After the debate Cuban said: I get audited every year my taxes are — it takes me 45 minutes just to sign all the different taxes that I have to spend. And I tell my tax lawyers and everybody, you know, take advantage of — do what the law recommends. But I’m not against paying taxes. And I’ll give you a perfect example. When the Dallas Mavericks were building a new practice facility which was just opening I had the opportunity to go to Dallas and and play different cities against each other to get different rebates and everything. I didn’t do it. A couple years ago we had some issues in Dallas, I just wrote a check to the general treasury. This year we had, after the shootings in Orlando, I had concerns about the LGBT community in Dallas. I just wrote a million dollar check to the city of Dallas to support a bunch of different programs. I’m, I’m the luckiest guy in the world. There’s nobody who’s been as blessed as me and my family, so far, knock on wood, is healthy, and at some point you have to realize you have to give back. And you have to realize that this is a country that’s been great to us. And you can’t just take, take, take, take, take, take. .@mcuban on Trump saying not paying taxes makes him smart #debatenight pic.twitter.com/uPNunatukV — Stefan Becket (@becket) September 27, 2016 The contrast between Cuban and Trump could not be more stark. Cuban believes in paying his fair share to society to help those who are less fortunate than him, while admitting he owes his success to society. Trump is content and even proud that he bleeds society for as much money as possible, while offering to pay back nothing. Did Trump say he was interested in paying higher taxes? No. Did Trump say he would like to reform the tax code so that he would be forced to pay higher taxes? No. Trump has no interest in paying his taxes to help fund schools so that children will grow to be more intelligent, because if they did they would certainly not support him. Trump has no interest in paying taxes to help pay for the roads which are used to deliver the cheaply made Chinese goods to which his name is affixed. In Trump’s world there is a two-tiered system. One for him, and one for everyone else.
Warning, Muslims, if you want to chant “Allah” over and over on a plane, there might be repercussions! Faisal Ali and his wife, Nazia had boarded a Cincinnati bound Delta Air Lines flight in Paris, France. The plane sat on the tarmac for about 45 minutes. During that time, several flight attendants noticed that the husband was sweating, hiding his phone, and that both he and his wife were chanting “Allah” repeatedly. It made the flight attendants uncomfortable, reports the Independent UK. One of the flight crew (after having cleared it with the captain) approached the couple, and told them to gather their belongings as they would have to exit the plane over “safety” concerns. Faisal’s wife, Nazia, can be seen in this cell phone video becoming combative, asking if it’s about “discrimination.”  A person who appears to be the captain tells Nazia that it’s a “safety of flight issue.” Mad World News reports that, When the Alis exited, a French police officer was waiting for them outside the gate and an airline worker was carefully reviewing their passports. The couple went through a brief interrogation process and they were okayed for release. It was then that the Delta employee explained that the pilot had made the decision to kick them off the flight because crew members noticed their particularly strange behavior and felt “uncomfortable.” The couple was promptly booked on another flight and sent home and has now offered them a refund as a gesture of good will. Of course, this wasn’t enough to satisfy their entitlement. The inconvenience caused by their unconventional behavior was seen by them as being nothing less than a case of “Islamophobia.” So, the couple immediately called the terror-tied, Saudi-funded Council on American-Islamic Relations to whine about their alleged persecution. CAIR is accusing the airline of repeated profiling of Muslim passengers, and, if this is true, Delta is probably one of the safest airlines to fly. Because France is suffering from a constant barrage of Islamic terrorist attacks, they are taking measures to prevent Muslims from killing their citizens. Personally, I applaud the flight attendants and the captain. Muslims can scream “Discrimination!” all they want. If you’re acting suspicious, you Will be removed from a flight, especially with all of the terror attacks that have been happening as of late. The flight crew was acting out of fear for their, and their passenger’s safety. Imagine if the couple Were terrorists. They could’ve taken the plane down, killing hundreds on board. Safety first, as they say. The hell with your feelings about being “discriminated” against. People want to LIVE, and not be attacked by terrorist scum.  Did the flight crew make the right decision? Share if you think they did! By Jeff Rainforth Like Jeff on Facebook Follow Jeff on Twitter 
There shouldn’t be an estate tax period. Right now the rate stands at 40%. If Hillary Clinton gets her way, she’ll raise it to a whopping 65% and I would not be surprised to see it go even higher. We are being taxed to death and Hillary loves taxes. Taxation equals slavery… it is enforced compliance and I view it as unconstitutional. But these rules don’t apply to elitists such as the Clintons who are now definitely in the top 1% of the wealthy out there. They have several tax shelters that keep this from applying to them. Isn’t that nice? I guess when they kick off, they want to make sure that Chelsea gets their wealth. But it isn’t just the estate tax with these people… they have accounting methods that shield them from almost all taxation.  From Breitbart: Hillary Clinton wants to increase the estate tax to 65 percent on the wealthiest Americans, according to her latest tax plan. The Clinton campaign estimates that the increase would raise an addition $75 billion in revenue over the next decade. The current rate maxes out at 40 percent. But Hillary Clinton and her husband Bill have created a number of tax shelters in recent years to dramatically limit their payment of the very same tax. As Bloomberg reported back in 2014: “To reduce the tax pinch, the Clintons are using financial planning strategies befitting the top 1 percent of U.S. households in wealth.” In 2010 the Clinton created “residential trusts” and the following year moved their Chappaqua estate into the trust, according to their financial records. As David Scott Sloan, a partner at the firm Holland Knight explained the Clinton trust to CBS News, “You’re creating things that are going to be on the nontaxable side of the balance sheet when they die.” The move will save the Clintons hundreds of thousands of dollars in estate taxes, according to accountants quoted by Bloomberg. These types of taxation shelters are common among the wealthy. They do not typically apply to the rest of us. If Clinton could get away with it, she would impose a 100% tax rate. In essence, they are already doing that by using multiple layers of taxation. Creative accounting seems to only apply to the wealthy. Those who see themselves as above the rule of law. Just as Clinton skated on the email scandal and other felonies, she has found a way to shelter her wealth. She’s also adept at money laundering. She’s a multi-talented corrupt barracuda and should be in prison, not running for the presidency.  
The liberal media jumped on the story of Keith Lamont Scott, an “unarmed” black man who was shot in cold blood by North Carolina police. His only crime was holding a book and waiting to pick up his son from school. What a heartbreaking story. It’s a shame for the liberal narrative that it’s not anything close to the truth. Not only did reports conflict with the story of Lamont’s girlfriend (a woman also recording the event from about 20 feet away), but new body cam footage released by the police clearly show that Scott had an ankle holster and was holding a weapon. This coincides with the officers’ numerous orders for him to drop the gun. This also coincides with Scott’s previous convictions for assault with a deadly weapon and carrying a concealed weapon. Here’s definitive proof of Scott holding the gun, according to a user on Twitter: Can we put the debate to rest now? pic.twitter.com/aniW2yxwje — Quake Gyan (@QuakeDawg) September 26, 2016  And a more detailed analysis of the newest video by political commentator and popular YouTuber, Mark Dice.  It’s clear that the liberal media doesn’t care about what actually happened. It’s clear that they’ll gloss over the fact that he had a gun and previous convictions for assaulting people with concealed weapons. The only thing that matters to them is the justification for rioting and the race-baiting tactics that keeps black people and white people at odds for political gain. It’s disgusting, and America is better than this. Share this video everywhere if you think that this was a good shoot and the police were within their rights to protect themselves from a dangerous man. (Source: YouTube) 
This is a major escalation for Obama’s “JV Team.” If our men and women die from a chemical attack, it’s on Obama’s head for not taking out the terror pieces of sh-t years ago. The chemical is believed to have been a mustard agent. US troops who were in the area of the attack went through decontamination showers. Via Fox News: ISIS fighters are believed to have attacked U.S. and Iraqi forces with a chemical weapon Tuesday evening, a U.S. official told Fox News. The U.S base outside Qayyarah, 25 miles south of Mosul, came under rocket fire, and traces of a “mustard agent” were believed to be present, the official said. The attack was first reported by CNN. A Pentagon official told reporters that a “tar-like black oily substance” was found on one of the shells that landed within the base, only hundreds of yards from U.S. forces. An initial test for the agent was positive, but “could be false,” the official said. The second test was negative, possibly because the shell had been exposed to the elements. The official said the base is attacked “fairly often” with conventional weapons, but Tuesday’s assault is believed to be the first chemical attack on U.S. forces in Iraq since they returned to the country in 2014. Nearly 5,000 U.S. troops are currently on the ground in Iraq and “hundreds” of those forces are located at the base, the official said. Read more… 
Dear President Bush. I am interested in buying the artwork that you recently offered. You are multi-talented and an amazing man! I have been a faithful defender and supporter of you and your policies. However, your lack of support for the Republican Party and presidential nominee has left me confused and disappointed. Your silence in the face of republicans, including your father, supporting the opposition has made me question your judgment and integrity. Silence and passivity have historically allowed great tragedies to unfold. It would be a tragedy to elect a president who would continue to accelerate the destruction of principals that we hold dear. As stated, I would like to buy your artwork – but not if it symbolizes a world view that no longer supports conservative ideals. I would like to be able to continue to support and defend the Bush family. I cannot do so until it is clear where your support and loyalty stand. Please make clear to the American people that your will honor your legacy by opposing the radical left and supporting conservative values. The decline of America has been precipitous and needs to be stopped. I look forward to your reply. 
It almost pains me to say it, but Israel probably has the ONLY leader in the world in possession of an Actual Spine. Don’t get me wrong – Benjamin Netanyahu is one of my all-time favorite world leaders. I only wish that we had someone to match his strength, conviction, morality, and spirit. Instead, we have President Mom Jeans. Today, Bibi spoke at the United Nations General Assembly, which can’t be an easy thing for him to do. After all, an organization that puts representatives of nations who think Israel doesn’t deserve to exist in positions of authority isn’t going to look too kindly on the Israeli Prime Minister. But now that I think about it – if you’re speaking to a group of people who pretty much hate you and your citizens, you are pretty well free to speak your mind plainly. Which is EXACTLY what Bibi did today. Here’s a clip of his speech – Here’s more of his speech – Focusing on innovation, intelligence and water technology, Netanyahu said that despite the UN “deserving every word” of his previous criticism of the body, he was positive that Israeli expertise in these areas mean it has a “bright future” in diplomacy. Shortly after telling the assembled diplomats that they would soon change their voting patterns on Israel at the world body, Netanyahu openly called Arab states “allies for security, prosperity and peace.” “For the first time in my lifetime many other states in the region recognize that Israel is not their enemy, they recognize that Israel is their ally,” he stated. “Our common enemies are Iran and ISIS, our common goals are prosperity and peace.” “I hope that in the future we will work together openly,” he added, truly taking the growing regional cooperation out of the closet. In his address, just one day after meeting with US President Barack Obama on the sidelines of the General Assembly, Netanyahu also focused on the “unbreakable bond” between the two nations. “Our unbreakable bond with the US transcends parties and politics,” he said. “It reflects, above all else, the overwhelming support of Israel among the American people, which is at record highs, and for which we are grateful.” The truth is that women and minorities in Israel are the most free in the Middle East, which totally freaks out places like Saudi Arabia and Syria. They just use the UN to punish Israel for giving its citizens freedom and liberty, instead of forcing them to live under tyrannical religious extremist rule. But just for fun – compare what women in Israel can do and have done (what PM Netanyahu talked about in his speech), to what women in Saudi Arabia have to endure. Yeah, no contest. If, for some reason, I was forced to leave America and I had to choose to live in either Israel or some other Middle Eastern glorified sandbox, I would go to Israel, no question.
During Monday nightâs presidential debate, Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump of screwing thousands of his workers out of the wages that they owe him. It was a shining moment for Clinton, that highlighted how Trumpâs entire fortune comes from not his business savvy, but his unending greed and eagerness to exploit anyone he can. Before saying that she is glad that Trump never did business with father, she directly told Trump that he needed to apologize to all those he hurt, saying: âDo the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that theyâve produced and then refused to pay them?â One of those people that Trump stiffed over is an architect named Andrew Tesoro. Tesoro sat down for an interview on , where he revealed how Trump did not pay him the $100,000 dollars that were owed to him for helping to a clubhouse at one of Trumpâs many golf courses. Tesoro was asked whether he was paid for the work he had done on the clubhouse. He responded by saying: âNo, he didnât. He paid partially along the way and the project snowballed over a four year period and our role in the project snowballed as well. We became very much involved in interior design and construction stage work. We made many supplemental agreements as we went along and in the end those agreements were not honored.â Because Trump will do anything to distance himself from his fraudulent business practices, he recently asserted that Tesoro probably wasnât paid because of shoddy work. That comment should really be biting him in the ass now. Thatâs because Tesoro revealed that Trump had written him a letter of recommendation in 2006. In the letter, Trump praised Tesoro for his work. Tesserâs experience is not unique. It seems like every day that more people are coming out in droves and exposing the various ways that Trump has royally screwed them over. One report has been particularly damning. found that Trump has been involved in over 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades. They also found that he has left everyone from cabinetmakers to carpenters left without being paid in full, or on time. While those numbers certainly make it easier to understand how far reaching Trumpâs fraudulent practices are, hearing it from someone who was a victim of them makes it so much more real. You can watch Tesoro expose Trump for scam artist in his own words below.  
A group of over fifty former intelligence officials and national security experts have written a letter demanding that he disclose the details of his “overseas business investments.” Signed by both Republicans and Democrats, the call for transparency comes as Trump defiantly doubles down on his refusal to release his tax returns and reveal any potential conflicts of interest he might have as President. “Donald Trump still has not revealed to the American public his international business relationships, even as it becomes increasingly clear that his overseas ties could well constitute significant conflicts of interest when it comes to charting U.S. foreign policy. This is unprecedented for a candidate for the nation’s highest office. As such, we are calling on Mr. Trump to disclose, in full, the nature of his business relationships overseas — to include specifically who his business partners are and what and where are his foreign investments. The Newsweek article reports that Mr. Trump courted Muammar Qaddafi, a dictator who murdered his own people and who once pursued nuclear weapons and conducted terrorism against Americans. Newsweek also asserts that Mr. Trump’s other business partners have included Kremlin-tied oligarchs and Russians with mafia links, an individual accused of money laundering for the Iranian military, a Turkish media tycoon accused of running a fuel-smuggling ring, Indian companies that may have violated India’s laws in their pursuit of business with Mr. Trump, and a South Korean company mired in scandal. Importantly, according to this news item, Mr. Trump’s business partnerships owe millions of dollars to Chinese entities. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised Vladimir Putin’s authoritarian leadership, while outlining policies that read like a Kremlin wish list. He has claimed that Putin would never invade Ukraine, suggested permanently ceding Crimea to Russia and placed conditions on upholding our obligation to protect our NATO allies. He has floated lifting sanctions against Russia, which would benefit both Putin and the Trump Organization. Our policies must be motivated exclusively by what is in America’s best interest, not by the financial interests of our president. The onus is on Donald Trump to assure voters that this will be the case by disclosing the nature of his overseas relationships and committing to divest such assets.” The letter was penned by signatories as noted as former acting CIA director Michael J. Morell, former undersecretary of Defense Michael G. Vickers, and former national security adviser Samantha Vinograd. Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns would appear to indicate that there are some serious irregularities that could potentially doom his candidacy for President, which his son pretty much confirmed in a foolish statement. The content of those tax returns has been the subject of much speculation, but given Trump’s long history of tax evasion and political bribery, it doesn’t take much imagination to assume he’s committing some kind of fraud. He’s also suspected of accepting bribes from Russian oligarchs and has done business with authoritarian rulers like Libya’s now-deceased Muammar Qaddafi, the emirs of the United Arab Emirates, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s ruling House of Saud. So what exactly are you hiding, Mr. Trump? The full letter can be found here.
Last night, the city of Charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. During the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. The police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying – and that the shot came from law enforcement. One key eye witness report emerged from Charlotte on Twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from Todd Zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: “I didn’t want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. Let the record show.” My friend @neutralized was on the ground in Charlotte. He saw the shooting. Here's his account. pic.twitter.com/H5cQXrAn37 — Max Berger (@maxberger) September 22, 2016  We interviewed Kahran Meyer, who is a North Carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm: I watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. — PAID LEAVE (@kahranasaurus) September 22, 2016  “I didn’t realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let’s march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight. “The protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,” Meyer told me almost breathlessly, “I’ve been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant ‘hands up, don’t shoot’ and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.” “After leaving ‘The Epicenter,’ police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful – and that’s when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.” Meyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, “oh, absolutely.” Five minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street. “It wasn’t a gunshot,” she told us. “It was much louder. It wasn’t a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly ‘They just shot him’ and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn’t already left, exited.” At that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters. It took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was ‘entirely too loud for a gunshot too. It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.’ CNN reports, “Police say the person was shot by a civilian.” The City of Charlotte began spinning the protester’s grave injuries immediately on Twitter: ALERT: Fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @CMPD did not fire shot. — City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016  Two additional eye witness reports have emerged on Twitter refute the Charlotte police’s claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. The first is from the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed Palestinian rights activist. “I saw the man go down on the pavement,” said Minister Steve Knight of Missiongathering Christian Church in Charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at Charlotte-Meckenberg Police for the shooting, “It was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.” #Charlotte Clergy question media & police accounts of tonight's shooting of protester. #CharlotteProtest #KeithLamontScott pic.twitter.com/TlVOwveYAV — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) September 22, 2016  Lastly, a man named Eddie Thomas posted on Facebook – which was also shared via twitter – that, “within 5 mins (no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground, eye rolling in the bakc of his head. he got shot with something, maybe a rubber bullet. I yelled at the bike cops for help and they did nothing.” @RockB_LOOP @michele__arias @kahranasaurus pic.twitter.com/yTJtaScBGU — Taryn J Mitchell (@tarynj19) September 22, 2016  When African-Americans attempt to express their frustration and anger and the violence inflicted upon them by the state, the state responds the only way it knows how – with more violence.

The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, is troubled by the cash payments to Iran. You have to agree: You don’t want your enemy to be enabled to fight you harder, stronger, or longer. In his rush to create a legacy, President Obama has created, instead, this problem that our military must face. Read the article below.  As Written By Kristina Wong for The Hill: Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, the nation’s top military officer, said Thursday that reports that U.S. payments to Iran will go to the Iranian military are “troubling.” “It certainly is troubling. The more funds that they have available, obviously the more effective they’ll be in spreading malign influence,” the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told the Senate Armed Services Committee. He was responding to questioning by Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), a member of the committee, who referenced recent reports that the Iranian government has approved a law that would allocate to the military the $1.7 billion the U.S. paid Iran this year to settle a failed arms deal from the 1970s. The administration has argued the payment was not a “ransom,” as critics have claimed, but that an international nuclear accord signed in January paved the way for the payment and a release of prisoners at the same time. Since the signing of the accord, U.S. military leaders say Iranian naval forces have stepped up their harassment of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf. Dunford also said Iran continues to be one of the lead ….. Full Story Here: Top US general: ‘Troubling’ that Iran military will get US cash | TheHill
I’m convinced that the rioters in Charlotte are just doing this for attention. They want to be the next viral sensation on social media (even if that’s for beating the crap out of an unarmed white guy trying to get out of a parking garage). That’s why they trek across state lines to be where all the action (and the news coverage) is. And, of course, they have their own cameras in their phones to document their stupidity. There was this “die-in” protest in Charlotte last night – presumably to “illustrate” how many black people are supposedly killed by cops (if this were true, would the police have time for anything else? My best guess – probably not). But while the protesters were supposed to play “dead,” they couldn’t help but take selfies of themselves while doing it – Die-in outside #CMPD #CLTProtest pic.twitter.com/tj4dmHOQzX — Ann Doss Helms (@anndosshelms) September 23, 2016  “We’re supposed to play dead?

Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many Syrian refugees as possible, adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants. This quickly turned into a horror show, as crime was unleashed onto German cities, with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year. The German people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in Germany, because they just dealt a crushing blow to Merkel’s conservative Democrat party and voted them out by a large margin. Merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could, citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided, and that she regrets the mistake she made, also referring to multiculturalism as a “living lie.”  According to the Daily Mail, Speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference, she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis, ‘we can do this’, but effectively admitted Germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx. ‘A continuation of the current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society, even in a country like Germany,’ she said. The leader, once known as the ‘Iron Chancellor’, won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face. However, she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals. ‘We want to, and we will, noticeably reduce the number of refugees,’ she told the conference in Karlsruhe. ‘With an approach focused on the German, European and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.’ Mrs Merkel attempted to defend her August decision, which drew hundreds of thousands to Europe, claiming it was a ‘humanitarian imperative’. She appealed to the party’s sense of history, saying that the same strength that allowed it ‘to rebuild from the rubble of the war to create the economic miracle, and to go from division to a reunified country’ would get Germany through the crisis. She said she was banking on a multi-pronged approach to cut migrant numbers, urging bolstered protection for the bloc’s external borders, support for Turkey to host refugees long-term and a long-shot bid for a distribution scheme among EU member states. She also touted a range of measures already undertaken in Germany including speeding up the deportation of failed asylum applicants. Mrs Merkel, who has been the country’s leader for a decade, tried to paint an upbeat vision saying it was no longer the ‘sick man of Europe’ and ‘should be a country that is open, curious, tolerant and even exciting’.  It’s nice that she recognizes this, but it’s too little, too late. It came as no surprise to anyone voting Trump, but then again, it’s getting tiring to say “I told you so” so many times to so many different people. Hillary is still full-steam ahead on increasing the number of migrants into the country, so there’s no telling what can happen if she is allowed to win the election. We have to stop her in November by storming the voting booths and voting with our consciences. (Source: Daily Mail)

A ninety-six-year-old World War II veteran and longtime New Yorker contributor Roger Angell has voted in eighteen elections. As he prepares to vote in his nineteenth, he has published an op-ed in which he shares his wisdom and experience – and sends a dire warning to the American people. This man, who has lived through the most dangerous threats to ever face our nation, including the prospect of nuclear Armageddon, believes that the election of Republican nominee Donald Trump would be a catastrophe on the same level: “My country faces a danger unmatched in our history since the Cuban missile crisis, in 1962, or perhaps since 1943, when the Axis powers held most of Continental Europe, and Imperial Japan controlled the Pacific Rim, from the Aleutians to the Solomon Islands, with the outcome of that war still unknown. “ Angell acknowledges Trump’s long history of outrageously offensive statements but chooses to focus on the one closest to his heart: military service and the lessons of the Second World War, the most destructive conflict humanity has ever fought. “I stick at a different moment—the lighthearted comment he made when, in early August, an admiring veteran presented him with a replica of his Purple Heart and Mr. Trump said, “I always wanted to get the Purple Heart. This was much easier.” Mr. Trump is saying he wishes that he had joined the armed forces somehow (he had a chance but skimmed out, like so many others of his time) and then had died or been scarred or maimed in combat? This is the dream of a nine-year-old boy, and it impugns the five hundred thousand young Americans who have died in combat in my lifetime, and the many hundreds of thousands more whose lives were altered or shattered by their wounds of war. I take this personally, representing as I do the last sliver of the sixteen million Americans who served in the military in my war…I experienced the loss of more than twenty close friends, classmates, and companions of my youth, who remain young and fresh in memory. I have named them in previous pieces, along with some wounded survivors, like my friend Gardner, an infantry captain who landed at Normandy Beach and fought at Hürtgen Forest and Aachen and the Battle of the Bulge, was twice wounded…my late brother-in-law Neil, who lay wounded on the field for two days during the battle of Belfort Gap, and who hobbled with a cane all his life, and with two canes near the end. Every American of my generation can supply stories like these, and once learned and tried to forget that, worldwide, seventy million people died in our war. Far too many people have forgotten the lessons of that dreadful conflict – or never learned them at all, as in Trump’s case. Trump is a selfish coward at his core; a draft-dodger who then had the nerve to compare his promiscuity with the sacrifices of the hundreds of thousands of young Americans who perished in the jungles of Vietnam, a man who mocks war heroes and insults the families of our slain warriors, a man who uses our veterans for cheap propaganda stunts and tosses them aside once they’ve served their purpose. Trump is uniquely ill-suited for the presidency, a man enslaved by his ego and devoid of principle – negatives that deeply disturb Mr. Angell. “Mr. Trump is endlessly on record as someone who will not back down, who cannot appear to pause or lose. He is a man who must win, stay on the attack, and who thinks, first and last, “How will I look?” This is central, and what comes after it, for me, at times, is concern for what it must be like for anyone who, facing an imperative as dark and unforgiving as this, finds only the narcissist’s mirror for reassurance.” On the other hand, Mr. Angell has glowing praise for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, a woman who has spent her entire life in public service, who has shown time and time again that she has a backbone of steel and is up to the pressures of the Presidency: I will cast my own vote for Hillary Clinton with alacrity and confidence. From the beginning, her life has been devoted to public service and to improving the lives of children and the disadvantaged. She is intelligent, strong, profoundly informed, and extraordinarily experienced in the challenges and risks of our lurching, restlessly altering world and wholly committed to the global commonality. Her well-established connections to minorities may bring some better understanding of our urban and suburban police crisis. Ms. Clinton will make a strong and resolute President—at last, a female leader of our own—and, in the end, perhaps a unifying one. He saves his best criticism for the end, however, as he nervously ponders what a President Trump might be responding to an ordinary day in the White House: “If Donald Trump wins this election, his nights in the White House will very soon resemble those of President Obama.  A new day is arriving, and with it the latest rush of bad news—another police shooting out West, another suicide bomber in Yemen, and other urgent briefings from a world already caught up in the morning’s difficult events. He needs to respond, but the beginning of this President’s response is always reliably at hand: How will I look?” We absolutely cannot elect a President that will put his own public image above the needs of the American people.

During tonight’s debate, Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he received a “small loan” from his father to begin his business career. That “small loan” was for over a million dollars, and his father continued to give him financial backing throughout the early years of his career. His “success” is proof of the adage that you “need money to make money,” as he borrowed $14 million from his father and received a blind trust fund which gave him another million. Trump complained to POLITICO that “It has not been easy for me. It has not been easy for me. I started off in Brooklyn. My father gave me a small loan of a million dollars,” Trump remarked. “I came into Manhattan, and I had to pay him back, and I had to pay him back with interest. But I came into Manhattan and I started buying properties, and I did great.” Yes, poor Trump spent his early years in expensive boarding schools and was given start-up money for his “business” career, the success of which has been questionable at best, given his multiple bankruptcies. It’s hard to imagine anyone more representative of the selfish excesses of wealthy America or be more disconnected from the struggles of everyday Americans. It’s mind-boggling to understand how anyone can pretend this man cares or even understands the problems facing the American middle class.  
The whole world is talking about Donald Trump, over which he is no doubt preening because any attention is good attention as long as itâs focused entirely on him. But besides the obvious problems with this, thereâs one tradition thatâs very important among international leaders and diplomats. Trump is getting dangerously close to destroying it. The tradition is this: You donât trash-talk a foreign countryâs political candidates. That might seem silly. It might seem trivial. Itâs not. This is a very old tradition that was actually turned into policy at the 1961 Vienna Convention. While different countries interpret âThou shalt not interfere in foreign countriesâ electionsâ differently, most are careful to keep their mouths shut, at least publicly. Even in 2004, when the whole world hated George W. Bush for the fiasco that was Iraq, foreign diplomats and leaders mostly kept quiet. Not so now. Trump is testing everyoneâs patience, and many find that they just canât keep it to themselves: âIf you represent one of these countries that has been insulted or attacked, you tend to react. We are very passionate, and our blood is pretty hot. But we have to play it cool and understand that this is a campaign, and an election, and that we are diplomats.â This week, thousands of foreign diplomats are gathering in New York City for the U.N. General Assembly. Trump has insulted a great many of them in one way or another. What the Latin-American diplomat said to is true around the world: âAdding to the complications is that U.S. elections are increasingly followed intensely by people overseas, whether itâs via Facebook or CNN International. So when a U.S. presidential candidate slams a foreign country as Trump has so often (with Mexico, Japan, China, members of NATO, and on and on) representatives of those countries feel unusual domestic pressure to respond.â Wars of words could easily escalate into more serious wars with Trump. Heâs proven that with his threats against both Ted Cruz and John Kasich for the 2018 midterms â he canât let a slight go. As another example of how he goes after everyone who pisses him off: Heâs busy trash-talking a Scottish whiskey company for daring to give an award to a neighbor of his who criticizes his golf course. In retaliation, heâs banned every brand of whiskey from William Grant & Sons for that affront, because really, how dare they? He should have more important things to worry about than petty personal slights, but theyâre actually the centerpiece of his whole existence. When foreign leaders wonât play ball his way, and go on record with nothing but what he thinks are insults, whatâs he going to do? Two guesses what heâll do, but youâll only need one. He hasnât even been elected yet and foreign leaders and diplomats are openly attacking him. Some of these people probably held their tongues when George W. was running for re-election, however hard that might have been. This would be hilarious if it wasnât so frightening. 
What is going on with the NFL? What has happened to America’s greatest sport? The ratings have plummeted as of late, though definitely not enough to make any lasting damage…that is until fans get completely fed up with the anti-cop attitude and 44% of them decide to boycott…but that’s just talk, right?  Well that’s the word on the street and if it does happen you can thank Colin Kaepernick and the number of other players who are protesting racial injustice by refusing to stand for the National Anthem, or raising the Black Power fist, idiotically not knowing what that symbol means. Let’s see what the feckless Roger Goodell has planned when the people who line these player’s and the owner’s pockets with cash, completely abandon these creeps.  There’s a recent poll going around that reveals that 44% of fans would actually go through with the threat. Now this is an internet poll, so take it with a grain of salt…just saying. It’s going to be a good time to see if they actually have any conviction. According to the poll, there could be a number of factors. Some stated the absence of Brady and Peyton was enough to get them to stop watching the games, while a healthy third of the poll said that the actions of Colin Kaepernick played a major role in their decision to not watch.   With further riots happening after recent police shootings, it won’t take that much to believe that the kneeling isn’t going to stop anytime soon. But how long can it go on? To what end is all this going? What’s the endgame for these knee jerk reactions to police shootings? Whatever it is, Roger Goodell is going to have to make a decision. Is he going to bring the fist down and fine players each time they disrespect our country? Or is he going to go along with the PC culture… My money’s on the latter. 
As more questions are raised about Hillary Clinton’s declining health, Donald Trump is breaking records! Now, he holds his largest lead ever against “sick Hillary.” The latest Rasmussen poll shows that, as more voters are paying attention to the race, millions of voters find Hillary Clinton’s criminal behavior to be unacceptable. This is shaking the political establishment to the core! With the first presidential debate coming on Monday, Donald Trump has moved to a five-point lead over Hillary Clinton, his biggest advantage since mid-July. The latest Rasmussen Reports weekly White House Watch telephone and online survey finds Trump with 44% support among Likely U.S. Voters to Clinton’s 39%. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson earns eight percent (8%) of the vote, while Green Party nominee Jill Stein holds steady at two percent (2%). Three percent (3%) like some other candidate, and five percent (5%) are still undecided. (To see survey question wording, click here.) Last week, the Republican nominee edged ahead of his Democratic rival 42% to 40% after trailing her by four points the week before. Trump’s total this week ties his highest ever level of support from two months ago. Democrats and Team Hillary were recently ready to move into the White House, and are now seeing their well-financed campaign combust into flames. In a recent conference call, Hillary Clinton wondered why isn’t she “50 points ahead?” This is a meltdown: Hillary Clinton wondered aloud Wednesday why she wasn’t trouncing her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, in the polls. After running through some of the core tenets of her campaign in a video conference call with supporters in Las Vegas, the former secretary of state said: “Having said all this, ‘Why aren’t I 50 points ahead?’ you might ask?” “Well, the choice for working families has never been clearer,” the Democratic presidential nominee added. “I need your help to get Donald Trump’s record out to everybody. Nobody should be fooled.” Here is the outrageous clip:  Hillary clearly thinks she is entitled to the Presidency. As a leading establishment politician, she can’t understand why so many Americans – including Democrats – are excited to vote for such an untraditional, unfiltered candidate like Donald Trump. Hillary represents the status quo and political corruption, while Donald Trump cannot be bought! As time continues and we learn more about Hillary Clinton’s health, these numbers will only improve for Trump. With high negatives, Hillary Clinton simply can’t compete. What do you think think of Trump’s incredible lead over Hillary Clinton? Please leave us a comment (below) and tell us.  
Over the weekend, Barack Obama addressed the Congressional Black Caucus for the last time as President. He hammered the Republican nominee and admonished black voters to vote for the Democratic nominee. He said he’d take it as a “personal insult” for members of the Black community not to vote for her. Here’s what he said: “If I hear anybody saying their vote does not matter, that it doesn’t matter who we elect — read up on your history. It matters. We’ve got to get people to vote,” Obama said. “I will consider it a personal insult — an insult to my legacy — if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election. You want to give me a good sendoff? Go vote.” Well, there’s at least one member of the Black community who doesn’t care that it would be a personal insult to the president for him to vote not only against Hillary, but for Donald Trump. He goes by A.D. Bell, and according to his Twitter profile, he’s an “Army Vet, Realist Party Affil., Father, College Graduate, Man, Not a Liberal or a Conservative.” In his video, Bell asks the President what he’s going to do to him, since he’s voting for Trump. When people say they’re “insulted,” they act on it, he said. “So, what are you going to do to me, Mr. Obama?” an incensed Bell asked. “I feel like liberals and Democrats have insulted me for a long time. I feel like liberals and Democrats have insulted black people for a long time.” “You know what I’m doing?! I’m voting against them!” he yelled, pointing to his camouflage ‘Make America Great Again’ hat.

Penn Jillette, most famous for being one half of magician duo Penn & Teller, has shared with Reason TV about how Trump is more dangerous than anybody suspects, citing his time working with him on  Jillette talked to Nick Gillespie about how, similar to many aspects of Trump’s campaign, even the fundamental set up of the reality show was based on a lie. “I mean, we’re co-workers on a television show,” Jillette said. “He’s not seeing if he’s going to hire me. He has no job. The places he could hire me—the casinos that he has that have showrooms—he put into bankruptcy. He no longer owns them. So, he can’t hire me, plus I have a job, so that’s all completely fake, right?” Jillette reported that while he was on the show, the Trump organization tried to coerce him into endorsing a potential Trump presidency. “There was a time when they asked me while I was still on the show if Donald Trump ran for president, if I’d support him, and I said absolutely not. And I believe, and this may be the most damning thing you’ll hear me say about Trump, I believe I liked him more than anyone else who was on that show. During that time I said I would not support him for president. Now, I get a call instantly. Instantly! From the powers that be—not Trump himself—saying, ‘No, no, no. You must support him as president.’ They say ‘It’s going to come down to you and Trace [Adkins], and he’s going to want to know that you both support him for president. And I said, ‘Well, I don’t.’ And they said, ‘Well, you have to because he’s trying to—he’s looking at the big picture here.’ And I go, ‘We’re on a television show.'” Penn is an avowed libertarian, loyal to neither the Republican or the Democratic parties, and currently endorses Gary Johnson. Despite not being a big fan of Clinton, Penn says that Trump is an unusually incompetent candidate: “However bad you think he is, he’s worse.” “I think he doesn’t really have strong convictions and sense of right and wrong. He’s not really, really smart. He’s not stupid, you know. He’s not a dumb guy, but he’s not smart like presidents are smart. We make jokes—everybody’s makes jokes except me about George W. Bush not being smart. He’s smart. He just is. Obama’s smarter? Probably, sure. Obama’s smarter than Clinton? Probably. Almost certainly. But they’re up here, you know, and if we’re talking about it. You’re wherever you are, but you’re not smarter than Obama, you know. None of us are. Even the smart guys you know aren’t there. And Trump isn’t one of those people. He’s not someone who when you’re having a conversation with him—I probably listened to him talk for, I don’t want to exaggerate, but probably eight or nine hours. A monologue of Trump. And I can’t think of one thing he said that I went, ‘Oh yeah!'”      
We are absolutely heartbroken to hear about the death of someone that was so special to everyone in country music. She always had a smile on her face and she lit up any room that she walked into. Jean Shepard was 82 years old and after only a couple of days in hospice care we had to say our goodbyes. Jean Shepard was a Grand Ole Opry member and she wasn’t just any member. Shepard was known as the “Grand Lady”. In 1955 she was inducted and in 2015 she was the only female that had ever been a member of the Opry for 60 years – which is how she earned the name.  The Grand Lady was also inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame a couple of years ago in 2011. She was passionate about country music, and loved what it stood for. Of course, like many older stars she felt like country music just isn’t the same as what it used to be. In one of her final interviews with Women Of Country at the Grand Ole Opry she told all. “Sixty years ago, I loved what the Grand Ole Opry stood for,…I still love what it stands for, but not quite so much. Isn’t it terrible being so truthful?”  The Grand Lady passed away from complications due to Parkinson’s disease on September 25, 2016. Jean’s publicist shared about her life in a press release and we are heartbroken. “Jean was born Ollie Imogene Shepard in Oklahoma and raised one of ten children in Visalia, California. At age 14 she was spotted by country star Hank Thompson singing and playing bass in the all-girl band she’d formed called the Melody Ranch Girls. Thompson brought her to the attention of Capitol Records and soon the trailblazing Shepard was setting the precedent in country music for a young woman recording and touring on her own rather than as a member of a family act, a duo, or a band’s ‘girl singer.'” There is truly no one like Jean, and there never will be another Grand Lady. She was survived by her husband and her 3 sons. Please continue to pray for this family during their time of loss.  RIP JEAN SHEPARD
If you are one of the GOP candidates who is still saying #NeverTrump, you have been warned. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus on Sunday suggested he could say “never mind” to the “Never Trump” candidates should they try to make another run for the presidency. That is one way to get your troops to fall in line. Will the big heads get the message?  As Written, Reported and seen first on Fox News: Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus on Sunday suggested he could say “never mind” to the “Never Trump” candidates should they try to make another run for the presidency. Priebus said the former primary challengers who’ve refused to support Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump could face consequences if they fail to back Trump in the stretch-run to Election Day. “Those people need to get on board,” Priebus told “Face the Nation.” “And if they’re thinking they’re going to run again some day, I think that we’re going to evaluate the process – of the nomination process and I don’t think it’s going to be that easy for them.” Priebus didn’t specifically name the group, but Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush are the most prominent ex-GOP primary candidates to refuse to support Trump. Cruz and Bush were locked in particularly nasty verbal spats during the campaign with Trump, who termed his opponents “Lyin’ Ted” and “Low-Energy Jeb.” Though Kasich and Trump rarely went toe-to-toe, Kasich was the last Trump challenger to drop out of the race, and despite the Republican National Convention being held in Cleveland, the Ohio governor didn’t set foot in Quicken Loans Arena. Cruz spoke at the convention, but he was booed off the stage when he told the assembled, largely pro-Trump crowd to “vote your conscience.” Despite the intra-party squabbles, however, Priebus made his case by pointing to a pledge that each primary candidate signed vowing to support the eventual Republican nominee…..

They don’t call CNN the Clinton News Network for nothing. They’re there to defend the presidential candidate at all costs and not let any inconvenient facts get in the way. CNN host Chris Cuomo – the New York Governor’s little brother – got into a tense exchange with one of Donald Trump’s advisers Boris Epshteyn. Cuomo argued that Trump should come clean with the birther issue, just as Hillary Clinton owned up to her private server issue. “With Hillary Clinton, she had to own the server thing,” Cuomo said. “It was wrong. We heard from all the people around her that it was wrong, she shouldn’t have done it, it was poorly thought out. It wasn’t enough. Why?” Epshteyn responded that they’re not the same thing. “And Hillary Clinton — there’s no equivalency. Hillary Clinton did something illegal. She broke the law.” They continued: Chris Cuomo: She did not do anything illegal. Boris Epshteyn: Yes, she did. Cuomo: James Comey’s a liar, too? Epshteyn: He said she shouldn’t be prosecuted. He did say she acted carelessly, and as a lawyer, if you look at all the particulars of bringing that case, there was a case to bring. And he said so, too. Cuomo: No, he didn’t. He said there’s no case that could be brought, there’s nothing prosecutable about it. He just said it in his report. He said it wasn’t a close call. Never mind the fact that even the FBI Director himself stated that it is a “felony to mishandle classified information either intentionally or in a grossly negligent way, or a second statute making it a misdemeanor to knowingly remove classified information from appropriate systems or storage facilities.” Isn’t that exactly what Hillary Clinton did? Comey even said that she was “extremely careless” – in other words, grossly negligent – in her handling of classified information. And everyone knows that she had some 13 different mobile devices in addition to her private home server, which had on it classified information.

Republicans have been crossing party lines to announce their votes for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton throughout this year’s general election in numbers not seen in decades. Now, Politico reports that the highest level defection yet comes from former President George H. W. Bush, who revealed to a Kennedy that it was time to go public in favor of the Democratic party’s candidate Hillary Clinton: Bush, 92, had intended to stay silent on the White House race between Clinton and Donald Trump, a sign in and of itself of his distaste for the GOP nominee. But his preference for the wife of his own successor, President Bill Clinton, nonetheless became known to a wider audience thanks to Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, the former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy. The Republican Party’s embrace of unrepentant racism under Trump is personally stinging to the Bush family after his sons Jeb Bush married women of Hispanic origins and learned Spanish. It’s no surprise that the eldest Bush of the bunch would declare early his vote for Hillary Clinton. Both of Texas’ major daily newspapers in Houston and Dallas, who are both deeply conservative news organizations, endorsed Hillary Clinton long before this year’s presidential debates, which kick off next week. It must be reassuring to the elder statesman’s rare crossing of party lines, knowing that he can trust the depth of Hillary Clinton’s national security experience and that her relationships with foreign leaders is unmatched by any party’s nominee in possibly all of our nation’s history. Former President George H.W. Bush won’t be the last prominent Republican to declare for Hillary Clinton in this year’s General Election, but he is one of the few whose judgement we can actually respect.
Leftist loon Chris Hayes, host of little-watched All In With Chris Hayes on MSNBC, took to Twitter to bless us with his idiocy on Monday, expressing his relief that the radical Islamic terrorist who attacked New York over the weekend used bombs rather than guns for the attack. We're also very very lucky that the attackers tried to use explosives rather than guns. — Christopher Hayes (@chrislhayes) September 19, 2016  God only knows how to interpret Hayes’ logic. I’m not even going to take a stab at it. However, the reaction on Twitter was immediate and brutal: @chrislhayes and knives rather than a gun in Minnesota — Sam Stein (@samsteinhp) September 19, 2016  Even actor Nick Searcy weighed in… Hey, by the way, how did that guy with the knife in MN get stopped? OMG IT WAS A GUN THAT STOPPED HIS KNIFE!!!! @samsteinhp @chrislhayes — Yes, Nick $earcy! (@yesnicksearcy) September 19, 2016  Because as we all know, bombs are preferred to “evil” guns, right Chris? @chrislhayes He shot a cop this morning. One person. His bomb injured 29, and could have been a lot more deadly. — Charles C. W. Cooke (@charlescwcooke) September 19, 2016  Some wise advice from the crowd: Buy guns. You have a duty to protect others. And it enrages liberals who want you helpless. Win-win.@Mark_Meed @chrislhayes — Kurt Schlichter (@KurtSchlichter) September 19, 2016  This expression explains it all: .@chrislhayes Uh. pic.twitter.com/M2X6uIeFrx — Tom Nichols (@RadioFreeTom) September 19, 2016  Bombs could hurt and/or kill people a lot faster than guns, Chris. Probably Hayes and his progressive leftist Democrat ilk, from Obama on down, would have loved for guns to be used rather than bombs because then they could use the attack as an anti-Second Amendment rights issue. But since a knife was used in Minnesota and bombs were used in New York, Hayes and lunatics like him won’t have that luxury. Oh, and Chris, there are already plenty of laws against stabbing people and setting off bombs. Why aren’t you asking for more knife or bomb control, hmmm?  Email Subscribe
Wow! Bravo Tomi! You really nailed it this time…Enjoy!  “This notion that ‘political incorrectness’ is somehow responsible for terror attacks is absolute BS! Do you think we are stupid?” “How dare you blame this crap on Donald Trump! Excuse me? Was he Secretary of State? Did 4 Americans die on his watch in Benghazi?”  
On Saturday, September 17 at 8:30 pm EST, an explosion rocked West 23 Street in Manhattan, in the neighborhood commonly referred to as Chelsea, injuring 29 people, smashing windows and initiating street closures. There were no fatalities. Officials maintain that a homemade bomb, which had been placed in a dumpster, created the explosion. The explosive device was removed by the police at 2:25 am and was sent to a lab in Quantico, Virginia for analysis. A second device, which has been described as a “pressure cooker” device similar to the device used for the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, was found on West 27th Street between the Avenues of the Americas and Seventh Avenue. By Sunday morning, all 29 people had been released from the hospital. The Chelsea incident came on the heels of an incident Saturday morning in Seaside Heights, New Jersey where a bomb exploded in a trash can along a route where thousands of runners were present to run a 5K Marine Corps charity race. There were no casualties. By Sunday afternoon, law enforcement had learned that the NY and NJ explosives were traced to the same person. Given that we are now living in a world where acts of terrorism are increasingly more prevalent, when a bomb goes off, our first thought usually goes to the possibility of terrorism. After all, in the last year alone, we have had several significant  incidents with a massive number of casualties and injuries in Paris, San Bernardino California, Orlando Florida and Nice, to name a few. And of course, last week we remembered the 15th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks where close to 3,000 people were killed at the hands of terrorists. However, we also live in a world where political correctness is the order of the day and the fear of being labeled a racist supersedes our natural instincts towards self-preservation which, of course, includes identifying the evil-doers. Isn’t that how crimes are solved? Law enforcement tries to identify and locate the perpetrators of the crime or the “bad guys.” Unfortunately, our leadership – who ostensibly wants to protect us – finds their hands and their tongues tied. They are not allowed to be specific about their potential hypotheses for fear of offending anyone. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio – who famously ended “stop-and-frisk” profiling in his city – was extremely cautious when making his first remarks following the Chelsea neighborhood explosion. “There is no specific and credible threat to New York City from any terror organization,” de Blasio said late Saturday at the news conference. “We believe at this point in this time this was an intentional act. I want to assure all New Yorkers that the NYPD and … agencies are at full alert”, he said. Isn’t “an intentional act” terrorism? We may not know whether it is from an international terrorist group such as ISIS, or a homegrown terrorist organization or a deranged individual or group of individuals. It is still terrorism. It is not an accident. James O’Neill, the New York City Police Commissioner had already ruled out the possibility that the explosion was caused by a natural gas leak at the time the Mayor made his comments.  New York’s Governor Andrew Cuomo was a little more direct than de Blasio saying that there was no evidence of international terrorism and that no specific groups had claimed responsibility. However, he did say that it is a question of how the word “terrorism” is defined. “A bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism.” Cuomo hit the nail on the head, but why did need to clarify and caveat before making his “obvious” assessment? The two candidates for president Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump also weighed in on the Chelsea explosion. Clinton was very generic in her response saying that “we need to do everything we can to support our first responders – also to pray for the victims” and that “we need to let this investigation unfold.”  Trump was more direct. “I must tell you that just before I got off the plane a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows what’s going on,” he said. “But boy we are living in a time—we better get very tough folks. We better get very, very tough. It’s a terrible thing that’s going on in our world, in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant.” Unfortunately, an incident like the Chelsea explosion reminds us how vulnerable our country is particularly in venues defined as “soft targets.” Now more than ever, America needs strong leadership which is laser-focused on protecting her citizens from terrorist attacks of all genres and is not afraid of being politically incorrect.

Bill Clinton has a slew of ex-girlfriends who I’m sure want to take a shot at Hillary, but one of them is actually doing it. Once you listen to what he has to say about Mrs. Clinton and the reason she believes Hillary is having suddenly noticeable health problems, you’re going to find yourself agreeing. Dolly Kyle, who I had never heard of before right now, is the author of Hillary: The Other Woman and has a long, sordid past with the Former President of the United States Bill Clinton. The book details some horrible interactions with the Clintons, including a situation where Hillary actually blew up at a group of handicapped children while serving as the First Lady of Arkansas.  Kyle may have hit the nail on the head with her keen analysis of the Hillary Clinton health issue. “I really think she has been ’cruisin’ for a bruisin’, as we say in the South, because she’s such an angry person and so driven by this inner rage,” said Kyle. “People like that eventually break down, physically.” But, she asserts, Hillary’s “inability to keep her lies straight” is not necessarily attributed to her anger, but “cognitive impairment.” I can’t say that I disagree. I’ve known several people who are just hateful and angry and they have a tendency to suffer from more physical ailments than the rest of us. Of course this isn’t going to be true of all people, but I have personally noticed a correlation between angry people and mental issues. But Kyle says that anger is not the only strong emotion Clinton feels. “That paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,” warned Kyle. “I call her ‘Hillary Scissorhands’ because of her predilection for destroying records which could get in the way of her goals.” I recommend buying Dolly’s book if you don’t already have it, because it is a disturbingly deep look into the behaviors of a woman who may very well become the next President of the United States. And with so many people, including former Secret Service agents, telling stories similar to the ones that Kyle has written about, there has to be some measure of truth to them. Do you think that Clinton’s health issues may be related to her behavior and attitude as a person? Let us know in the comments of our Facebook page!

A few days ago, Donald Trump’s despicable spawn tweeted out a meme comparing refugees fleeing chlorine gas and napalm in Syria to “poisoned Skittles,” implying that allowing them to resettle in the United States would lead to increased terrorist attacks. Donald Trump Jr’s meme is referencing an idea with a long history in white supremacist and neo-Nazi thinking and is nothing but a heartless Islamophobic attack against innocent people fleeing an unimaginable hell on earth. Over the past week, hundreds have perished as Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and his Russian allies rain hellfire upon the city of Alepp. Over half a million have perished in Syria’s civil war. Hundreds of thousands of people in cities across Syria are starving, trapped in besieged cities with no way to get fresh food. Hospitals, markets, schools are bombed indiscriminately. Rebel-held areas are dominated by jihadi groups that institute harsh religious law; in regime areas, tens of thousands vanish into the depths of Assad’s prisons to be raped, tortured, and eventually killed. The people of Syria need our help. The conflict is of our making thanks to George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq; our refusal to hold the Assad regime accountable for his crimes means we contribute to the slaughter being perpetrated every day. Comedian Eli Bosnick gave an incredibly powerful explanation for just why the Skittles meme is so offensive – and how we should really feel about accepting refugees.  That’s what real courage looks like. That is how a REAL American, a real human, should feel.
A waitress is facing major backlash after sharing a photo of herself with former president George W. Bush and his wife Laura along with a caption some have called "insensitive" and "stupid." Leisa Smith tweeted a photo of herself with George W. Bush and the former first lady after she served them at the restaurant where she works and captioned it, “Bush did 911 but he did me a solid and left me a hella tip #.”  According to Leisa, the former president left her a $40 tip on his $21 bill. As the tweet began to go viral, Leisa started facing backlash from Twitter users. “I hope you work there till you 70 lol. You ain’t ready for the real world!” one user wrote, said Daily Mail. “You gladly take his money and then dog him on social media? So disrespectful and uneducated,” another user wrote. ”I hope you grow up and learn. Good luck.” Mic reached out to Leisa for comment and she said that “Bush did 911” comes from a meme she and her friends use. She said she only intended for a few friends to see the tweet and that she thought it would be funny. The “Bush did 911” meme originated during an interview with Charlie Sheen in 2006, according to Mic. Since then, many on the internet use the meme to make fun of conspiracy theorists who believe the Bush administration was responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. “I have a couple of friends that use the meme a lot and they were the only ones I was expecting to see the tweet,” Leisa told Mic. “I was just trying to get a laugh out of my friends but I in no way actually believe the conspiracy.” Leisa tweeted a follow up to clarify her comments, in which she said Bush and his wife “were the nicest people I have ever met and had I known the tweet would blow out of proportion like this I would have never tweeted.” 
Tonight’s debate is at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. This will be the third presidential debate hosted by the university, so you’d think students would be used to this sort of thing. Guess I was wrong. Look what a CBS News reporter found in the student center: Sign inside Student Center at Hofstra. I guess these are common now on college campuses? #TriggerWarning pic.twitter.com/gfRkKVtToM — Tony Aiello (@AielloTV) September 26, 2016  Yep. A trigger warning. Young adults actually require trigger warnings ahead of presidential debates now. They HAVE to be warned that they might hear some ideas that they–GASP!– disagree with. Some of the debate topics are super scary OMG! I wonder how many students will miss school tomorrow. Donald Trump’s presence may induce vomiting and cause mass panic attacks. Quick! Someone grab the smelling salts! If you require a trigger warning ahead of a presidential debate, you’re too much of a child to vote. Period. h/t The Right Scoop

Footage of the explosion that took place in New York on Saturday night is now being shared across all social media sites. An explosion on Saturday night in what is known as New York’s “Chelsea neighborhood” left over 29 people injured. Mayor Bill de Blasio said that the explosion was definitely intentional, but as of now they do not believe it to be a specific terrorist threat. At a late night news conference after the explosion Blasio spoke saying that they are at full alert now. “There is no specific and credible threat to New York City from any terror organization. We believe at this point in time this was an intentional act. I want to assure all New Yorkers that the NYPD and … agencies are at full alert…Whatever the cause, New Yorkers will not be intimidated, they will not let anyone change who we are…”  The explosion on Saturday night wasn’t the only concern either. Authorities and examiners went searching the area on Sunday and found another explosive near the area of the explosion on Saturday night. A random pressure cooker was found about four blocks away from the site that the bomb went off. The police department tweeted around 2:30am stating that the device had been safely removed. “The suspicious device on West 27 Street in Chelsea has been safely removed by the NYPD Bomb Squad…”  New York Police Commissioner James O’Neill said that the explosion wasn’t a natural gas explosion but they also don’t have any other leads on the cause of the explosion either. They are treating the area as a crime scene in hopes to protect residents from harm. “The investigation is active and at this time an extensive search is being conducted. The area around the explosion site is being treated as a crime scene.” Watch the leaked video below, you can see the explosion and then you will see people running everywhere. This is so crazy!  Please pray for all of those who were injured….this has got to STOP!
The House Oversight Committee has ordered the website Reddit to preserve copies of posts purportedly published by the computer technician who appears to have asked for advice for how to strip Hillary Clinton’s email address from her emails. (If you are unfamiliar with the story, read this first) Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the Oversight Committee, told The Hill that the order “has the weight of law, you can’t destroy things and hope things magically get erased.” The posts in question appear to have been made by Paul Combetta, a technician at Platte River Networks, a Denver-based computer firm that Clinton hired in 2013 to manage her private server. They were deleted on Monday, just after Internet sleuths discovered them and circulated them across the Web. In the posts, a user going by the handle “stonetear” asked other users for advice on how to “strip out” email addresses from the account of a “VIP.” “Basically, they don’t want the VIP’s email address exposed to anyone, and want to be able to either strip out or replace the email address in the to/from fields in all of the emails we want to send out,” reads the post, which was published on July 24, 2014. That date is a significant point on the Clinton email timeline. Just the day before, the House Select Committee on Benghazi had reached an agreement with the State Department to obtain Clinton’s work-related emails. The FBI’s report of its investigation of Clinton’s emails shows that that same month, Combetta transferred backups of Clinton’s emails to two of her lawyers, Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson. “Stonetear’s” post on Reddit raises questions about what was being covered up. And if “stonetear” is Combetta, as seems likely, the Reddit post would not be the first example of the technician engaging in an apparent cover-up. Combetta is the technician who used a software program called BleachBit to delete backups of Clinton’s emails in late March 2015, weeks after Clinton’s email setup was revealed in the press and after Congress had subpoenaed all of her records. He also lied to the FBI during an initial interview about his decision to use BleachBit. Regardless, the Justice Department granted him immunity in exchange for his cooperation with the email investigation. Last week, Combetta and another Platte River Networks technician named Bill Thornton declined to testify at a House Oversight Committee hearing. Both technicians pleaded the Fifth. The allegations that Combetta posted questions about Clinton’s server on Reddit “fit the pattern of what we think was happening,” Chaffetz told The Hill. Another Oversight Committee member, North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, said that while the circumstantial evidence “certainly points in one direction” — that “stonetear” is Combetta — the Committee wants to have definitive proof that he is. “We’re just trying to make doubly sure that we can authenticate that in a real way, because if not it will be challenged on a number of fronts,” Meadows told The Hill. Chaffetz also said that the committee has to verify the authenticity of the posts, “but we are pursuing it with vigor.” Numerous clues have surfaced which strongly suggest that “stonetear” is Combetta. Combetta’s email address is [email protected] , and other posts from the user refer to facts known about Combetta, such as that he lives in Rhode Island. TheDC uncovered other clues which lend more evidence to support the case that Combetta is the Reddit user. In some of the Reddit posts, “stonetear” refers to an email encryption service that Platte River Networks uses called Mimecast. He also refers to Datto, Inc., a cloud storage company that PRN hired to service Clinton’s server. A spokesman for Platte River Networks told TheDC on Tuesday that the company is not yet ready to comment on the matter but that it will “soon.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

This is hot off the presses folks – something dangerous is going on in the New York City metro area. At around 12:40 AM Monday morning police were alerted to a suspicious backpack near a trashcan in an Elizabeth, New Jersey trashcan. The men who reported it said they could see a pipe and wires sticking out of the bag. When police arrived they discovered FIVE different devices but when a bomb squad robot approached the bag one of the devices exploded, fortunately no one was injured. UPDATE: Elizabeth, NJ mayor says five devices found in bag near train station. One exploded while bomb squad robot tried to disarm it — Fox News (@FoxNews) September 19, 2016  The latest bomb scare comes just one day after two other bombs exploded (one in Seaside Park, New Jersey and one in Manhattan) and three more were found by authorities before they could be detonated. Late Sunday evening authorities announced that they believed all five bombs from Saturday were the work of the same people, then later in the night they announced that they had made five arrests in connection with the bombs. Federal authorities conducted a traffic stop of a “vehicle of interest” in the Chelsea bombing Sunday night in Brooklyn. A law enforcement source told Fox News that a “number of individuals” who are possibly connected to the explosion were taken into custody. Law enforcement officials told the Associated Press that at least 5 men were being questioned. The two officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about an ongoing investigation. The FBI said in a statement that no one had been charged with any crime and the investigation was ongoing. There is no word yet if the latest group of bombs found in Elizabeth, are connected to the just detained persons of interest. Elizabeth, New Jersey Mayor, Christian Bollwage speaking to the media about the bomb (you can see more video from the scene here):  UPDATE: The man sought in connection with the bombings in Manhattan and Seaside Park, New Jersey has been captured after a shootout with police. NEW PHOTO: Ahmad Rahami captured in Linden, NJ, senior law enforcement official says https://t.co/kuiR1Q6LUF pic.twitter.com/fYYurIZIeu — NBC New York (@NBCNewYork) September 19, 2016  Ahmad Khan Rahami is a Muslim man of Afghani origin who was living in Elizabeth, New Jersey (the city where the bombs were found late last night/early this morning). Authorities had launched a dragnet earlier Monday in search of the 28-year-old Afghan-born man, whom they described as being “armed and dangerous” A naturalized U.S. citizen, Rahami was wanted for questioning regarding the Saturday night blast in New York’s Chelsea neighborhood, an explosion in New Jersey’s Seaside Park on Saturday morning and a foiled bomb attack Sunday night near a train station in Elizabeth, NJ. An eyewitness to Rahami’s capture in Linden, NJ told Fox News that he saw a man walking down a street with a gun in his hand. A police car pulled up next to him and the man fired at cops 4-6 times. The shooter then began running down the street with several police cars trailing him, the witness, Peter Bilinskas, said. After days of pretending that the bombings were not the work of Islamic terrorists it seems that New York’s liberals are finally beginning to understand the truth. If a bomb goes off on American soil, it is more likely than not the work of Muslim terrorists. “Today I believe we’re going to find out that [the bombing] was influenced by foreign sources,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday on “Fox & Friends.” Reposted With Permission From Constitution.com  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.
A hardworking farmer went on ABC's reality show "Shark Tank" to pitch his product, which simply exists to improve the lives of other farmers, and was mocked for his lack of business expertise (video below). But by the end of his pitch, he had an investor and had won over the hearts of all the sharks on the panel. Johnny Georges, a farmer and the inventor of the Tree T-Pee, brought his invention to "Shark Tank," seeking an investment to help sell his product nationwide. As he explained his product to the panel of sharks and revealed that he had only sold within five counties of his Florida farm, the sharks were stunned. They began nearly mocking him for his lack of business experience and questioning how the company was expected to succeed.  Georges tried to explain that he wants to do what is right and to help other farmers, so he only makes $1 per Tree T-Pee. The judges were shocked he hadn't expanded his market or raised his prices, but he remained faithful to the greater cause. Finally, Georges' character won the hearts of the panel and John Paul DeJoria, co-founder of hair care product company Paul Mitchell, offered to give him exactly what he asked for. The moral of this story is certainly to stay true to who you are and what you believe in. Watch Georges' "Shark Tank" pitch below.  
The Washington Post’s intrepid reporter David Fahrenthold’s investigation into the Trump Foundation and the finances of Republican nominee Donald Trump have found yet another instance of foul play by the avaricious real estate mogul. It turns out that Trump has been using his tax-exempt charitable foundation as a vehicle for tax evasion by having companies that owe his money funnel it through the Foundation, allowing him to dodge the taxes on nearly $2.3 million in income.  For instance, the Trump Foundation received payments “totaling nearly $1.9 million from a man in New York City who sells sought-after tickets and one-of-a-kind experiences to wealthy clients.” Anonymous sources within the Trump organization indicate that the man, Richard Ebers, was instructed to pay Trump for goods and services to the Foundation instead. This helps explain why people kept on “donating” to the Trump Foundation after it became clear that not even the man it was named after cared enough to put any money into it – his last donation was in 2008. Senior Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn said that “what Trump did was provide a service, renounce any fees, and then merely ‘suggest’ that the other party make a donation to a charity of their choosing.” Which is the exact definition of shady business dealing. The Head of the Internal Revenue Service’s non-profit watchdog agency, apparently extremely negligent in his monitoring of the Trump Foundation, was absolutely dumbfounded by what Fahrenthold’s investigation is uncovering. “This is so bizarre, this laundry list of issues. It’s the first time I’ve ever seen this, and I’ve been doing this for 25 years in the IRS, and 40 years total”  said Marc Owens. It is absolutely clear that Trump is violating the rules surrounding tax-exempt foundations, rules that were written to stop this exact kind of dishonest money laundering. The consequences of those violations bring monetary penalties, the loss of tax-exempt status, and possibly – if we’re lucky – criminal charges. Trump has claimed innocence when queried on the issue. “Are you confident that the Trump Foundation has followed all charitable rules and laws?”asked journalist Sharyl Attkisson. “Well, I hope so…I mean, my lawyers do it” shrugged the Republican nominee. The Trump Foundation has no paid staff, let alone lawyers, so draw your own conclusions from that. It is absolutely astonishing that the Trump campaign would have the nerve to go after the Clinton Foundation when his own “charity” is literally a money-laundering organization that is being used to perpetrate tax fraud, pay political bribes to unscrupulous Republican politicians investigating his other fraudulent businesses, and purchase $10,000 paintings of himself. The polar opposite of charitable, Donald Trump’s greedy schemes border on the comical in their pervasiveness and extension. Corruption is his modus operandi, and we cannot allow him to turn our nation into a giant kleptocracy.
Donald Trump Jr. Is quite possibly the dumbest person ever to take to social media. In the very least, it’s a tossup between him and little brother Eric, who just yesterday made a fool of himself with his childish self-admiration for being the answer to a crossword puzzle question, along with free wifi, pushup bras and Bozo the Clown. Together, the dimwitted duo provide enough social media fodder to make fun of them well into the next generation with posts to spare. When this election is finally over, it will be almost sad to see them fade back into oblivion. Maybe we’ll keep track of their Twitter accounts just for a giggle every now and then. Today’s silliness begins with Oompa Loompa Jr. pinning a tweet that is certainly relevant to a particularly volatile national discussion happening right now: Colin Kaepernick and the National Anthem. As more and more athletes decide to take a knee in protest to support Black Lives Matter, more and more conservatives trash them for it, calling them unpatriotic and demanding they stop getting media coverage. Lord Cheeto II has been one of the most vocal, accusing Kaepernick of disrespecting our troops and those who died for his freedom. For the left, it’s a simple matter of the 1st Amendment. Regardless of how you feel about the issue, these athletes have the right to express themselves. Yes, that means from government oppression and prosecution and not public criticism, but let’s not forget that it’s people like Little Comb-Over who are calling for police to stop providing protection for these athletes, for their employers to terminate their contracts and some have even gone so far as to suggest they be jailed for treason. For years, we’ve known that the only constitutional amendment conservatives care about is the second, so when this tweet appeared pinned to Mini Douche’s Twitter account this morning, I couldn’t help but bust out in hysterical laughter:  Clearly when you’re the son of pure evil you have a hard time understanding the words you use. When “liberals” — otherwise known as “sane people” — try to explain why people like Kaepernick and those who have followed his lead are expressing that very right, we’re attacked in a frenzy of hate by people who think placing your hand over your heart and singing a song is mandatory patriotism. It’s not. The first amendment is exactly today what it was when the founders added it to the framework of a growing nation in 1789; the right to be you. The Supreme Court has sided with those “liberals” every time the issue of free speech is tied to something conservatives think should be compulsory, like the pledge of allegiance and school prayer. I’ve said it already once in this article and thousands of times in my everyday life and I’ll say it again: The 2nd Amendment is the only one they see as absolute. All others are open to the interpretation of some holier than thou asshole like Donald Trump Jr. Featured image by Gage Skidmore
In a particularly tense interview on CNN, Trump was called out for saying that Hillary Clinton is a âbigot.â When he was asked for any particular reasons on why, he just couldnât explain himself. He tried to pivot away from the question at handÂ and made himself look really foolish. Here is the exchange: Â Anderson Cooper: Youâve previously called Hillary Clinton Â a bigot. How is she a bigot? Trump: Well, sheâs a bigot. Anderson Cooper: But, how is she bigoted? Bigotry is having a hatred towards a particular group. Trump: Sheâs not doing anything for those communities. Anderson Cooper: (Again) So, youâre saying she has hatred or dislike of black people? Trump: Her policies are bigoted. Anderson Cooper: But, you said her policies are âpersonally bigoted.â Trump: Oh she is. Of course she is. Sheâs totally bigoted thereâs no question about that. Anderson Cooper: But, it does imply that she has antipathy, that she has hatred toward, I guess in this case youâre talking about African-Americans, but I donât want to put words in your mouth. But, is hatred at the core of that? Or dislike of African-Americans? Trump: Or maybe sheâs lazy.  Â  
Cities and towns across the nation are fighting Obama’s refugee resettlement efforts to terraform and seed the nation with Islamists. Imperial Beach is a suburb of San Diego and the fighting citizens there want no part of it. Mayor Serge Dedina issued a proclamation declaring Imperial Beach as a Welcoming City. People have pretty much figured out that means Sanctuary City and the Muslims are being forced on their community. He just retracted the proclamation because a) he bypassed the City Council and just did it and b) he pissed off most of the residents there. I don’t blame them for being mad. This fight can be won. The good people of Imperial Beach pushed back and won. All of us should be getting involved and doing the same in our individual communities. It’s a matter of safety, national security and survival. It only took a small, vocal group to make the mayor back down. That’s true patriotism and I’m heartened to see people taking a stand.  From 100PerCentFedUp.com: Last month, Mayor Serge Dedina issued a proclamation, declaring Imperial Beach to be a “Welcoming City.” The “Welcoming Communities” program is an Obama initiative intended to resettle large numbers of refugees from Syria, the rest of the Middle East and Latin America in cities and towns across America as part of his “fundamental transformation.” At the time, Mayor Dedina thought it was pretty harmless, but some people believe it goes deeper than that. They’re suspicious that the words, “welcoming city,” is another way of saying, “sanctuary city.” But Mayor Dedina says that a small town, and a relatively poor town, like Imperial Beach couldn’t handle such a thing, even if they wanted. But that’s not good enough for some skeptics. They want the proclamation erased. The mayor tried to claim the whole thing was a misunderstanding. Sure it was. He knew exactly what he was doing. So now he comes off as a shifty liar as well. Then he tried to dance on the subject and evade questions. Typical sleazy politician. Time to find a new mayor guys. Refugee resettlement is being used to bring into America hundreds of thousands of Islamic refugees and they are being settled in cities without telling the citizens. They bring mosques, Sharia law, disease, intolerance, hatred and crime with them. Combine that with illegal immigrants who are also being shipped all over America and you have the makings of a political coup. Americans must stand up and fight back or we will lose our country and our freedom through these Marxist programs.        
President Obama prides himself on his legacy for African Americans. He often touts his south side of Chicago childhoods as some type of rags to riches story. Despite the fact that he really grew up all over the world including in the Phillipines. You’ll often hear him discussing how his presidency has helped to quell racial tensions. Despite the fact that they are at an all time high as seen in Baltimore, Milwaukee, Charlotte, New Orleans and more. Democrat’s in general have had a very loyal demographic voting base in African Americans, women and Hispanics. Groups of people the party routinely targets during the election. But just because most vote blue doesn’t mean they all do. Now some minority citizens are expressing their outrage with President Obama and his legacy and spreading it all over Twitter. Here are a few outraged Twitter members, @Brownfractals @HillaryClinton I’m insulted by Obama more concerned about his damn legacy! What? Transgendered toilets? — Deplorable Latina (@terrymendozer) September 19, 2016  Obama’s Veto of Bill to Let 9/11 Families Sue Saudi Arabia Will Cement His Legacy https://t.co/p35ZkxJv0A via @usheraldnews — Roo??

Had no intention of helping USA pic.twitter.com/PC2ctoZQiQ — Hector Morenco (@hectormorenco) September 26, 2016  Donald Trump even posted a comment on Twitter in which he attached a video of President Obama speaking at an event saying that not voting for Hillary Clinton as an African American would be an insult to his legacy. As Donald Trump so eloquently put it, always worried about himself and never about anyone else. Watch the the speech here,  Other users called on the increase in racial rioting as a signal of his failed legacy and policy. Some called on his veto of the 9/11 bill that Congress passed allowing families of the victims of September 11th to sue Saudi Arabia. A few others mentioned the tremendous rise in mass shootings and terrorist attacks as well as his paying ransom to Iran for American Navy hostages. Just take a look on Twitter and everyone can see his legacy is not as squeaky clean as he would like everyone to believe. Especially in the gun control and healthcare department. But then again all that matters is his ego so his real legacy matters not to him.

Donald Trump was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Thursday for a campaign speech. He took time to address the unrest around the country in the wake of recent officer-involved shootings. Here’s what he said: “Before going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country. And it seems to be a never-ending problem. America desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness, that has not only gotten us through our toughest times – because we’ve had some tough times – but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation. “Everyday I see people of different backgrounds working together for common good, and we need to bring that spirit to every part of our country and become one American nation, united by shared values and principles as American citizens. We have to do it. And we have to respect our flag. We have to respect our flag. “We all have to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes and see things through their eyes, and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. We have some real problems. And we do have a wounded country. “Many Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screen. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world’s leader. How can we lead when we can’t even control our own cities? “We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest, and demonstrate. But there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others. “Every single American in our country is entitled to live in a safe community. The violence against our citizens and our law enforcement must be brought to a very rapid end. “The people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities where the crime is so rampant. It’s their jobs, housing market, schools, economic conditions that will suffer. And the first duty of government is to protect their wellbeing and safety. We have to do that. “There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a Trump administration. “Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disrupter, but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and get their children great educations. We have to cherish and protect those people.”   The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.
“I’ve never seen anything like this. He’s the Republican Obama in terms of online fundraising.” — A Senior GOP operative about Donald Trump Across the Internet many political observers are wondering if Donald Trump has become the Republican version of Barack Obama. Over the weekend, Mr. Trump stood up to decry the obvious acts of terrorism in New Jersey and New York. For his efforts he was attacked, criticized, and derided by liberals and their partners in the media. As New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D-NY) refused to call the terrorism what it was, Hillary Clinton attacked Trump for his “rhetoric.” Arguing that by talking tough, Mr. Trump was somehow giving “aid and comfort to the enemy.” “I don’t want to speculate but here’s what we know about I think it is important for voters to hear this and weigh it in making their choice in November,” Clinton said. “We know that a lot of the rhetoric used by Donald Trump is being seized upon by terrorists.“ Clinton says Trump's rhetoric has "given aid and comfort" to terrorists. Phrase is definition of treason. — Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) September 19, 2016  In fact, the left, almost as one, decried Trump’s comments as problematic and insinuated that he was encouraging Muslim terrorism by condemning the attacks. However, most Americans seem to have agreed with Mr. Trump, and by Monday most liberals in and out of the media had also come to realize that Trump’s early comments were correct. We don’t yet know how the weekend’s events will play into the upcoming election, but we can look at a few other indicators that give Trump and his supporters reason to be optimistic. Fundraising for example. Donald Trump has already, with 7 weeks left before Election Day, outraised both John McCain and Mitt Romney among “small donors.” Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has raised as much as $100 million from small-dollar donors contributing $200 or less to his campaign — in less than three months. Trump’s campaign has surpassed a “threshold no previous Republican has ever achieved in a single campaign,” according to Politico, which looked over Federal Election Commission filings and spoke with operatives familiar with the campaign’s fundraising efforts. All of this also shows what could be a building Trump tsunami…   Read the Rest of the Story at the Daily Surge… 
Donald Trump appeared on Â Monday morning and blamed the weekend attacks in New Jersey and New York City on refugees, a lack of profiling by law enforcement, and the First Amendment. Conservatives always go right past that First Amendment and only abide by the Second. Trump took aim at refugees; however, bombing suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, is a naturalized citizen. A Fox & Friends host asked Trump what he would do to stop âpeople who are radicalized here.âÂ Trump responded to that by saying âfreedom of the pressâ was to blame. âTheyâre all talking about it so wonderfully because, you know, itâs called âfreedom of the press,â where you buy magazines and they tell you how to make these same bombs that I saw,â Trump said. âThey tell you how to make bombs. We should arrest the people that do that because theyâre participating in crime. Instead they say âoh no you canât do anything, thatâs freedom of expression.ââ âThe websites are the same thing, those people should be arrested. Theyâre inciting violence, okay?â he continued. âTheyâre making violence possible. They should be arrested immediatelyâ¦yet we donât want to touch them because of freedom of speech.â Watch at around the 21 minute mark: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GTRabASaY8] However, incitement is already an exception to the First Amendment. Think Progress reports: Itâs a high bar to proveâââfor which Trump may have reason to be personally grateful. Under a laxer rule, itâs possible that Trump could be charged for incitement himself. In August, his statement that âSecond Amendment peopleâ could be able to do something about Hillary Clinton was met with widespread condemnation as a veiled assassination threat. On Friday, he called for Clintonâs bodyguards to âdisarm immediately,â adding âletâs see what happens to her.â Donald has attacked Freedom of the Press many times. Most recently, his campaign had a VICE reporter arrested. The GOP presidential nominee has gone as far as to defend Vladimir Putin for killing journalists. Trump said of Putin after being confronted by Joe Scarborough over the Russian leaderâs bloody history with journalists, âHeâs running his country, and at least heâs a leader. Unlike what he have in this country.â Freedom of the Press is part of our Constitution. Itâs not up for debate, unless Melania Trump feels like suing bloggers for quoting from a source. But if you ask Donald Trump Jr., heâll tell you that political correctness is to blame for terrorist attacks. Ironically, Juniorâs pinned tweet reads, âLiberals love the first amendment until you say something they donât agree with.â He really should change that. 
I don’t know what it’s like to be dumb. I have been a thinking individual my entire life. So being able to relate to 18-yr-old Zannay Laws and Dakei Perry and why they filmed themselves beating up and robbing an old man to post on social media will be a challenge. Based on their actions I can only say they were probably both dropped on their heads at birth and since then joined the Black Lives Matter movement. They seem to share the same mentality. A 64-year-old man was reading a book at 5 p.m. in the North Baltimore park near the Johns Hopkins University, little did he know that he was about to get the shock of his life. A group of young thugs found him and decided to rob him, but not in the normal robber way of “give me all your money”, they wanted to have some ‘fun’ with it. These millennials decided to film the whole thing for ‘prosperity’ or something (doubt they know the definition of the word). The first suspect held a gun to his head demanding his stuff like cellphone and money. The second stabbed the poor old man in his lower back. Even thought the man was incapacitated and had a gun on him, the third decided to spray mace in his face. Someone stabbed him again, this time in the right arm and the suspects took his iPhone, backpack and $60. All THIS while LIVE streaming on Facebook. Wow… brilliant folks we got here. They filmed their entire crime and put it out there for people to see, did they not know they created the best evidence to land themselves in jail? Serious asshats! Police spokesman T.J. Smith said, “Criminals do some crazy things. They record themselves committing crimes, and we thank them for it. We encourage the criminals to continue to record your acts, and encourage citizens to continue to send us information when you find the criminal wrongdoing on camera and on social media.” Smith said detectives were working to confirm the identities of the other two suspects, but said they believe the group has committed a series of crimes in the area. Smith called it a “little crime spree.” This group is suspected of other similar type crimes in the neighborhood and one in custody has already started singing. Would you at any age or stage in your life think stabbing and mace-ing an old man was fun? I’m just curious if this is only a Black Lives Matter thing. 
A member of Donald Trumpâs presidential campaign has creepy words about what could happen if her candidate becomes president of the United States. As part of a PBS special on the candidates, former contestant and current Trump 2016 director of African-American outreach Omarasa Manigault said the key to the campaign was Trumpâs desire to see his political enemies on their knees:  Omarosa Manigault, a contestant on âThe Apprenticeâ who is director of African-American outreach for Trumpâs campaign, explains what she sees as Trumpâs motivations for running for president. Among them: resentments. âEvery critic, every detractor, will have to bow down to President Trump,â she says. âItâs everyone whoâs ever doubted Donald, whoever disagreed, whoever challenged him â it is the ultimate revenge to become the most powerful man in the universe.â In the video accompanying Manigaultâs comments, the night of the 2011 White House Correspondentâs Association dinner is revisited, in which President Obama infamously roasted Donald Trump, who was in attendance. The President, riffing on Trumpâs promotion of the birther conspiracy theory, came at the reality TV star with his comedy guns blazing. Obama heaped joke after joke on Trump during the roast, and reports have indicated that Trump was seething but sitting stone-faced during the monologue. Some now believe that the episode embarrassed Trump so completely that he decided then to run for president as revenge for the humiliation. Regardless of whether that is true or not, history will record that as Obama was crushing Trumpâs spirit, he had already given the green light to the Navyâs infamous Seal Team Six to go into Pakistan and capture or execute al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. As the Correspondentâs Association audience laughed at Obama making fun of Trump, members of the U.S. Navy were in the process of killing one of the most wanted men in world history. And Obama never broke a sweat. 
We are heading into yet another day of unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina, and one GOP congressman is blaming the victims of systemic racism that lead to the deaths of so many black people at the hands of those sworn to serve and protect in the most blatantly racist way yet. North Carolina GOP Congressman Robert Pittenger had some extraordinary opinions to express here, but he swears he is not racist. Pittenger said that the protesters: âThe grievance in their minds, the animus, the anger. They hate white people because white people are successful and theyâre not.â Yes, he actually said that. Here is video of the statement, via BBC NewsNight on Twitter: Protesters in #Charlotte "hate white people" â North Carolina Congressman Pittenger tells #newsnight https://t.co/q6ELYD01QV â BBC Newsnight (@BBCNewsnight) September 22, 2016  As if that werenât bad enough, Pittenger went on to say: âWe have spent trillions of dollars on welfare, and weâve put people in bondage, so they canât be all theyâre capable of being.â Of course, the backlash was swift, leading the fool who should never be allowed to hold any position of power whatsoever to quickly try and pretend that isnât what he really meant, that he isnât really a racist. He insisted that he is simply upset, thatÂ âwhat is taking place in my hometown right now breaks my heart.â He also said,Â âMy anguish led me to respond to a reporterâs question in a way that I regret.â Pittenger, a die-hard Trumpkin, insists that he isnât racist eh? No, Rep. Pittenger, you ARE racist. Anyone who isnât would even think such a thing in response to these protests, much less say it. Face it â youâre a racist. You and the rest of the GOP can whine and complain anytime someone calls you on your ignorance and bigotry all you want â we all know the truth, right from your own mouths. Those of us who are aware know the truth, even though you donât want to look in the mirror and see yourselves for what you are: flaming racists. Run along now, Iâm sure your sheet and hood are ready to be picked up from the dry cleaners. 
Since the Reagan administration, Americans have been sold a bill of goods that tells us that inherited money is more valuable than earned money. Republicans would like all inherited money to be completely sheltered from any taxation, while for the most part, Democrats disagree. The compromise has been that only estates valued at a whopping $5.45 million or more ($10.9 million for married couples) are taxed. Anything below that is completely tax free. Now, Hillary Clinton, after prodding from Bernie Sanders and his followers, has revised her estate tax plan and trust me when I say Donald Trumpâs children wonât be happy. Previously, Clinton said she would restore the tax on dead rich folks to its 2009 levels, pushing up the rate from 40 percent to 45 percent, and making it kick in for estates worth at least $3.5 million (today, it only hits those valued at $5.45 million or more). But, no longer. Instead, sheâs borrowed a page from her formal primary rival, and now proposes turning the levy into a progressive taxâmeaning it will take a bigger bite out of wealthier estatesâwith a top rate of 65 percent. The last time the estate tax hit that level was in 1982, though back then it also kicked in on smaller inheritances. Beyond all that, Clinton has said she would largely do away with the step-up in basis at death, a rule that allows lucky heirs to avoid paying capital gains taxes that, say, their parents or uncle or other rich benefactor would have owed had they sold their stock before passing away. In the end, the committee expects these measures to raise about $225 billion over ten years. Source: Slate As it stands, the estate tax system is a joke. In 2012, a staggering $1.2 trillion was passed down as an inheritance. Of that, less than 1 percent was taxed. As for the Republican argument that estate taxes will hurt small businesses, in 2013, only 20 small businesses and family farm estates, in the entire country, had to pay estate taxes. The other common Republican argument is that estate taxes are âdouble taxationâ (as if every other dollar in the American economy hasnât been taxed multiple times), but the reality is that most of what comprises large estates comes from capital gains, which are also unlikely to have every been taxed. Of course, even if Clinton is elected, sheâll have a tough time passing this, at least as long as Paul Ryan is in charge of the House. He wants Trumpâs kids to pay zero in estate taxes. Of course, for all we know, Trump himself pays zero in taxes. 
Hillary Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin recently separated from her husband, Anthony Weiner, after a photo surfaced of Weiner sexting some random chick with their son right next to him. The Bunny Ranch legal brothel responded by offering Weiner a full time position as the director of social media, and we all laughed. But this? This is no laughing matter. It’s sick. According to that sourcelink, Weiner carried out a months-long online sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl. She claims he asked her to dress up in “school-girl” outfits and allegedly “pressed her to engage in ‘rape fantasies.'” The girl, whose name is being withheld by DailyMail.com because she is a minor, said the online relationship began last January while she was a high school sophomore and before Weiner’s wife, Hillary Clinton’s aide Huma Abedin, announced she was ended their marriage.   Weiner was aware that the girl was underage, according to DailyMail.com interviews with the girl and her father, as well as a cache of online messages. He knew this and sent her completely disgusting, inappropriate messages anyway. He sent her “bare-chested” photos of himself, called her “baby,” complimented her body and even told her he woke up “hard” thinking about her.  In one particularly lewd message, he told the teen: ‘I would bust that tight p***y so hard and so often that you would leak and limp for a week.’ The teen said she originally reached out to Weiner on Twitter in January. She said she was interested in politics and heard about his sexting scandals and wanted to know more about him. It was clear from the messages that she was encouraging Weiner to engage with her in a sexual manner. She told DailyMail.com she didn’t consider Weiner her boyfriend, but thought the relationship was a ‘romantic’ one.  She acknowledged during interviews that she had developed an obsession with Weiner, and sought him out on Twitter in January while trying to write a book about him. She said she continued to write the book as their relationship developed.  ‘Why did I message you [in January]?’ the girl wrote in an email to Weiner last week. ‘I was studying you- for a book of course. You were my Hannibal Lecter.  ‘I wanted to know what made you tick. As we chatted, I pretended to not know EVERYTHING about you. I didn’t want to appear suspicious.’  She also told Weiner: ‘I was obsessed with you.’  Weiner quickly messaged her back, and they struck up a conversation about the large snowstorms that had hit New York and the girl’s home state. From there, he sent her a friend request on Facebook, and the rest is history. The girl told DailyMail.com that she and Weiner first started talking on Skype a few days into the relationship. ‘[Weiner’s] son was in the bathtub at the time just downstairs,’ she said. ‘So he would yell at his son to check on him, and then he asked me to take my clothes off, and just started saying these really sexual things.’  Afterward, Weiner sent her a message with a heart-eyed emoji, writing ‘I caught a glimpse of your body’ and indicating he would like to keep talking over Skype.  She claimed the conversations grew more explicit as time went on, with Weiner allegedly asking her to undress and encouraging her to masturbate over video chat.  She said Weiner would not get fully nude, but was usually shirtless and wearing boxers.  ‘He would tell me to say his name as I was touching myself,’ said the girl. ‘He would ask me to take my clothes off.  ‘He would just have his shirt off. Sometimes he would grab his lower region, but that was about it,’ she added. Weiner didn’t deny messaging the teen and refused to address the specific allegations. “I have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent,” Weiner said. ” I am filled with regret and heartbroken for those I have hurt.” Weiner just got 195 times more disgusting. I know. I didn’t think it was possible either. If only his first name was Bill and his last name was Clinton. Then everyone would laugh about these sexual escapades. h/t Daily Mail
Progressive Democrats are the “helicopter parents” of America. They want to protect people so much that they end up doing more harm than good, and it’s keeping segments of the American population from being fully independent. This is NOT what our Founders envisioned when they set out to create our government.  One of the groups most negatively affected by liberal hand-holding is blacks. Don’t believe me? Just ask Thomas Sowell, who penned an amazing piece for National Review on this very subject. Back in the 1960s, as large numbers of black students were entering a certain Ivy League university for the first time, someone asked a chemistry professor — off the record — what his response to them was. He said, “I give them all A’s and B’s. To hell with them.” Since many of those students were admitted with lower academic qualifications than other students, he knew that honest grades in a tough subject like chemistry could lead to lots of failing grades, and that in turn would lead to lots of time-wasting hassles — not just from the students, but also from the administration. He was not about to waste time that he wanted to invest in his professional work in chemistry and the advancement of his own career. He also knew that his “favor” to black students in grading was going to do them more harm than good in the long run, because they wouldn’t know what they were supposed to know. Such cynical calculations were seldom expressed in so many words. Nor are similar cynical calculations openly expressed today in politics. But many successful political careers have been built on giving blacks “favors” that look good on the surface but do lasting damage in the long run. Sowell continues his piece, lamenting the creation and maintenance of the “welfare state,” a term used to describe a government that acts as a parent of the citizen. In 1960, before this expansion of the welfare state, 22 percent of black children were raised with only one parent. By 1985, 67 percent of black children were raised with either one parent or no parent. A big “favor” the Obama administration is offering blacks today is exemption from school behavior rules that have led to a rate of disciplining of black male students that is greater than the rate of disciplining of other categories of students.

(EDITOR’S NOTE: This video contains graphic content that may be emotionally disturbing for viewers.) A video of Keith Lamont Scott’s final moments, filmed by Scott’s wife, Rakeiya, has been made public. In the video, obtained by NBC News, Charlotte-Mecklenburg (CMPD) police officers are seen approaching the car where Scott, a father of seven, was waiting for his child’s school bus to arrive. Rakeiya Scott is heard shouting, “Don’t shoot him! He has no weapon!” while police are heard in the distance shouting at Keith Scott to “drop the gun.” “He doesn’t have a gun… he’s not going to do anything to you guys. He just took his medicine,” Rakeiya Scott said.  After four shots were fired, Scott is heard repeatedly shouting, “Did you shoot him?” And runs over to her husband’s car. “He better not be fucking dead, he better not be fucking dead, I know that fucking much,” Scott said as officers ordered her to come to them. “We are at 9453 Lexington Court, and these are the police officers who just shot my husband,” Rakeiya Scott said. “He better live.” From the angle of the recording, it is unclear as to what led up to the killing of 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott. As of this writing, CMPD officers have not released the body camera video of Scott’s death, despite calls from the community and even the New York Times editorial board to release it. Police were on the scene to search for a man with outstanding warrants, who was not Scott. However, Scott was nonetheless shot and killed by CMPD officers who allege he was brandishing a firearm. Scott’s mother, Vernita Scott Walker, told CBS News he was sitting in his car, waiting for his child’s school bus, and reading the Koran, which he did every day. “That’s a task for him every day, so he can be out there to get a special spot,” Walker said.”He sits in the truck and reads his book.”        
When you WATCH this VIDEO you MUST have tissues out. The further into the video I went, the more I cried. It starts out with a guy saying, “This goes out to the people who support Black Lives Matter. Until I see y’all protesting black on black crime that goes on in our neighborhood every f***ing day, shut the f**ck up goin’ around saying that Black Lives Matter. Shut the f**ck up with that sh*t!” You might wonder what he’s talking about so here are some statistics from the Uniform Crime Report’s Supplemental Homicide Reports published annually by the federal government that support his concern on black on black crime. These numbers explain why this guy is saying that black people are killing black people… because they are and en masse: ⦁While only 6% of the U.S. population is identified as black and male, 57.9% of the persons legally killed by a private citizen in self-defense were black males. ⦁ However, 73.1% of the black males legally killed by a citizen in self-defense between 2009-2012 were killed by a black citizen. ⦁ 42.6% of victims of all solved criminal homicides from 2009-2012 were black males ⦁ 89.6% of black males killed in criminal homicides from 2009-2012 were killed by another black male ⦁ 40.6% of the police officers murdered in the line of duty from 2009-2012 were killed by black males* In 2012, white males were 38 percent of the population and committed 4,582 murders. That same year, black males were just 6.6 percent of the population but committed a staggering 5,531 murders. In other words: black people–at just a fifth of the size–committed almost 1,000 more murders than their white counterparts. The figures above highlight a horrific truth that black racialists and white liberals routinely ignore: Lawbreaking black Americans, young black males particularly, put themselves in close proximity to (mostly white male) police officers at rates sometimes five to 10 times higher than whites. This is a recipe for disaster. Thusly…. Blacka are only 13% of the population but have committed half of homicides in the United States for nearly 30 years. DOJ statistics show that between 1980 and 2008, black people committed 52% of homicides. In 2013, black criminals committed 38% of the murders. Whites accounted for just 31 percent. There are five times fewer black people than white people in America and, yet, they consistently carry out a larger share of the crimes? Given this rate, it’s no wonder that there aren’t more assistances where cops kill black criminals. The video then leads to the speech of a police captain who is reporting on the drive-by shooting of a little girl and how he now has to send his officers out there looking for suspects with a gun under their seat. The video then goes into an emotional string of video where you see police officers hesitating to a criminal with a gun pointed at them, the officer always gets shot when hesitating. It helps anyone understand WHY police officers MUST shoot when being threatened, if they don’t they will be killed. Here are statistics that really show you who is getting killed more often; white criminals are. Of the 1,491 persons that died from police use of force from 2009-2012: ⦁ 915 (61.4%) were white males ⦁ 481 (32.2%) were black males ⦁ 48 (3.2%) were males of other races ⦁ 28 (1.9%) were white females ⦁ 15 (1.1%) were black females ⦁ 4 (0.2%) were females of other races If there is anyone who should be afraid right now it should be: 1. White male criminals because you’re more likely to get shot by police. 2. Black person who lives around black people because you are more likely to become a victim of homicide around more black people. 3. People who are in the Black Lives Matter movement because you are increasing your risk of injury just by being in an environment where the cops are your enemy… who will protect you? Plus you are literally standing among the people who commit the HIGHEST disproportionate amount of violent crimes in the nation. 4. All of us because the BLM are going to destroy the greatest police force in the world that protects our Bill of Rights better than anyone right now. We are about to get a Federalized police force and the Constitution is DEAD without the local Sheriff. 5. Police Officers because they’re in more danger today than ever before because of the farce of Black Lives Matter movement giving people permission to shoot white Police Officers just because. NOW, watch this VIDEO to truly understand what Police Officers go through and how their hesitation may cost their life and the lives of others.  
Who won the debate tonight? Donald J. Trump or the Lester Holt-Clinton team? NBC News’ Lester Holt had his “Candy Crowley” moment at the first debate of the 2016 presidential election on Monday night, bowing to pressure from the Hillary Clinton campaign and the liberal media by “fact-checking” Republican nominee Donald Trump on the question of his support for the Iraq War. Holt lived up to the expectations of his peers. But he lived down to the worst expectations of conservatives, who routinely see Republican candidates treated unfairly by debate moderators. Hillary also went over the 2 minute mark several times, while there were several times when Lester Holt would cut Donald Trump off after only having a little over a minute to answer a question.  Again and again, Holt asked Trump tough questions that were straight from the Clinton campaign’s talking points, and which were obvious set-ups for Clinton to attack (and for fact-checkers to pounce on whatever Trump asserted in his own defense). Here are the five worst examples. Tax returns. Holt never asked Clinton about her e-mail scandal, about Benghazi, or about the Clinton Foundation and its dubious dealings. But he did ask Trump about his tax returns, arguing — not asking — that there might be questionable information in them that the American public deserved to hear. Birther conspiracy theory. Holt never asked Clinton about her past record of racist statements, including her “super-predator” remarks as First Lady, or her explicit appeal to “white Americans” in her 2008 primary campaign against Obama. Yet he asked Trump about the Birther conspiracy theory and cast it as racist. Stop-and-frisk. After an exchange between the candidates over the policy of “stop-and-frisk,” Holt interjected to bolster Clinton’s point by stating, erroneously, that stop-and-frisk had ended in New York because it had been declared unconstitutional by a court. Trump countered, correctly, that the new mayor had canceled the policy before the litigation was over.  “A presidential look.” Towards the end of the debate, Holt asked Trump about what he meant by saying Hillary Clinton did not have “a presidential look.” He did so after noting that Clinton had become “the first woman” to be nominated for president by a major political party, thus setting Trump up as a sexist. As Trump answered, Holt interrupted him, then gave Clinton a chance to respond with her talking points about Trump’s past comments on women. Iraq War. The question of whether Trump supported the Iraq War or not has been widely debated. What is beyond doubt is that Hillary Clinton voted for it. Holt only represented one side of the debate about Trump, and never asked Clinton about her own vote. Via: Breitbart 
Hillary Clinton appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon on Monday evening, an appearance which was precipitated by Donald Trump’s appearance with the late night comic last Thursday. Both programs were ratings bonanzas with Trump’s program averaging a 2.6 rating share and Clinton’s program averaging a 2.8 rating share, the best rating The Tonight Show has had in five months. Clinton also scored higher ratings than Trump among adults who are between 18-49 with a 0.9 rating vs. Trump who garnered a 0.7 rating with this age group. While Hillary Clinton’s Tonight Show visit may have marginally defeated Trump’s in the ratings war, the program featuring the Democratic nominee for president was far less entertaining than that of her Republican challenger. With the exception of few moments, such as Fallon’s opening the interview by wearing a surgical mask and using hand sanitizer in reference to Clinton’s recent bout with pneumonia, the interview was not that funny. Fallon also had another good moment when he handed Clinton the bag which Trump “left in his dressing room” which contained a picture of Vladimir Putin in a heart shaped frame, a CD of Pink Floyd’s “The Wall” and an actual bag of softballs, a reference to the media accusing Fallon of doing a” softball interview “with Trump. Why the media expects a late night comic to conduct hard hitting interviews is a question for another day. While Fallon certainly was trying, Clinton did not appear to want to stay within the confines of a humorous exchange for very long. Clinton quickly steered a conversation that started off about the importance of her legacy as the first female nominee for president to one where she was attacking Trump. She went after Trump for “refusing to admit that President Obama is an American.” She also criticized him for his past comments where he referred to a Federal Judge, Gonzolo Curiel, who is an American of Mexican descent as a Mexican. Clinton also brought up Trump’s exchange with the Khans, the Muslim Gold Star family who criticized Trump’s immigration policy. The irony of Clinton’s Trump rampage was that she opened her conversation with Fallon by saying that she wanted focus on the issues and dispense with the rhetoric. Politicians and political candidates appear on entertainment programs to showcase their human side. Bill Clinton famously played the sax on The Arsenio Hall Show over twenty years ago. Clinton missed a tremendous opportunity to connect with the American people on a different level, to show them that she has a sense of humor and that she doesn’t take herself too seriously. Last fall, she appeared on Saturday Live as a bartender in a humorous skit. Recently, she appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live where she famously opened a jar of pickles to demonstrate her health. Of course the pickle jar episode is not that funny anymore now that we know that Clinton could have been suffering from pneumonia when she taped the program. No one is saying that Hillary Clinton needed to mess up her hair, but she would have done herself a better service if she treated the Jimmy Fallon interview as exactly what it was, entertainment. Clinton will have an opportunity to go after her opponent in an appropriate forum, namely the upcoming September 26 debate.

Usually, when I pass someone in a park, on a walk, or even when I get the mail – it is considered good manners to exchange some sort of pleasantry with the person you encounter. As a woman, I like to be reassured that that this is not someone with ill intent. This woman took it to the next level claiming ‘sexual harassment’ when a random white man dared to say ‘hello’ to her. *insert eyeroll*    This is why every claim of sexual harassment and rape must be investigated thoroughly. It’s sad to say, but you can’t just take a woman’s word for it anymore – mental health should always be looked into. If you see this, get your friend or family member some help – this is not normal behavior. Written by Katie McGuire.

Were you worried that Donald Trump might fall victim to a âconcentrated Satanic attack?â Yeah? Well, you arenât alone. But good news folks, you donât have to worry about that anymore! God himself is now protecting the GOP nominee from the Dark Lord. On Wednesday, Trump attended the Midwest Vision and Values Pastors Leadership conferenceÂ in Cleveland.Â Trump-loving black man who lost his damn mindÂ pastor Darrell Scott was worried that Satan might be after Trump too, which is ironic since most of us assumed the Republican nominee was workingÂ  the Prince of Darkness already. Scott claims thatÂ before Trump began is bid for the presidency, aÂ ânationally knownâ preacherÂ warned him âthat if you choose to run for president, thereâs going to be a concentrated Satanic attack against you.â âHe said thereâs going to be a demon, principalities and powers, that are going to war against you on a level that youâve never seen before and Iâm watching it every day,â Scott said. Scottâs wife, Belinda Scott, prayed over Trump as those around him laid hands on the bigoted billionaire, making sure Satan knew they were serious, dammit: âGod we ask you right now that Your choice is this choice.â âGod, I ask that you would touch this man, Donald J. Trump,â she continued, âgive him the anointing to lead this nation.â Because what would Jesus do? Well, duh! Heâd make America great again. And naturally, he would use a racist demagogue to do it. (*Insert eye roll here.) Personally, I think they are a little late. At this point, they probably should have moved straight to an exorcism before his head starts spinning around.

Do you remember Clock Boy, Ahmed Mohamad? You know, the Texas Muslim teen who brought a “clock” that didn’t look like a clock but rather like a bomb, to school then cried Islamaphobia when people freaked out because it looked like a bomb? You know, the Texas Muslim teen who was praised by Barack Obama for making a “cool clock” that didn’t look like a clock but he got invited to the White House anyway. You know, the Texas Muslim teen who received tons of gifts and adulation from Microsoft and a special invitation from Facebook to visit the company’s headquarters? You know, the Texas Muslim teen who went to live in Qatar for a year after receiving a scholarship to the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development because of his bomb-looking clock. (He’s now back in America.) You know, the Texas Muslim teen who is suing the city of Irving, Texas for $15 million and apologies from the police chief and mayor, continuing to try to milk his bomb-looking clock incident for all it’s worth? Yeah, that kid. Here is what he tweeted on the 15-year anniversary of 9/11. RIP the 2977 americans who died in 9/11 and RIP the 2 million innocent muslims who died during the US invasion for something they didnt do. — Ahmed Mohamed (@IStandWithAhmed) September 11, 2016  One guy, who was obviously a former supporter of Clock Boy, let him know that his slam against 9/11 was “not cool” so he would be unfollowing. @IStandWithAhmed not cool.

In a viral status update posted to his Facebook page, Robert Reich perfectly explained how to get through to a Donald Trump supporter. The Berkeley professor and U.S. Secretary of Labor recently wrote about an encounter with a voter supporting the GOP presidential nominee, and how he managed to convince the would-be Trump supporter to reconsider his support of the blustery billionaire. The post has caught fire, garnering nearly 25,000 shares in roughly three hours as of this writing. I finally found a Trump supporter — this morning when I went to buy coffee. (I noticed a Trump bumper sticker on his… Posted by Robert Reich on Monday, September 19, 2016 The post begins with Reich patronizing a local coffee shop, and encountering a man with a Trump bumper sticker on his car. When Reich asked the man if he was a Donald Trump supporter, the man defensively responded in the affirmative. Rather than attempting to preach to the Trump supporter, the former U.S. Secretary of Labor engagefd him in dialogue and asked him why he was supporting the GOP nominee. After the man told Reich he was voting for Trump due to his business acumen, Reich reminded him that Trump inherited most of his wealth, and invested it poorly. The man was silent by the time Reich told him about Trump’s real estate empire being largely built on the backs of taxpayers with nearly $900 million in public dollars. Reich’s account of the conversation is a perfect example of how to politely plant seeds of doubt in the minds of Trump’s supporters in the last 50 days before the general election: “I know he’s a little bit much,” said the Trump supporter. “But he’s a successful businessman. And we need a successful businessman as president.” “How do you know he’s a successful businessman?” I asked. “Because he’s made a fortune.” “Has he really?” I asked. “Of course. Forbes magazine says he’s worth four and a half billion.” “That doesn’t mean he’s been a success,” I said. “In my book it does,” said the Trump supporter. “You know, in 1976, when Trump was just starting his career, he said he was worth about $200 million,” I said. “Most of that was from his father.” “That just proves my point,” said the Trump supporter. “He turned that $200 million into four and a half billion. Brilliant man.” “But if he had just put that $200 million into an index fund and reinvested the dividends, he’d be worth twelve billion today,” I said. The Trump supporter went silent. “And he got about $850 million in tax subsidies, just in New York alone,” I said. More silence. “He’s not a businessman,” I said. “He’s a con man. “Hope you enjoy your coffee.” Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will meet for their first presidential debate next Monday.        
Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus appeared on CNN’s pre-Presidential Debate coverage Monday afternoon, absurdly joking with Wolf Blitzer that the Republican Party’s presidential candidate was ready for the debates because “he’d already been through 14 season finales” of Trump’s reality TV show The Apprentice. Of course, it makes absolutely no sense to equate a gaudy half-hour of programming that loosely classifies as entertainment with what is arguably the hardest and most significant hurdle in the journey to becoming the most powerful elected official on the planet, but false-equivalency is after all, the biggest theme of this election. In his latest act “The Donald,” who is apparently “not a fan of mock debates” because “he can get bored,” has decided to eschew traditional methods of debate preparation, instead opting to watch footage of Mrs. Clinton’s best and worst debate moments to look for vulnerabilities. When asked about Trump’s preparation for the debates, Priebus didn’t appear to be concerned about how Trump would perform at the debates, “He’s very comfortable,” Priebus said. “He did a great job in our primary debates. He will be prepared. He’s always shown up for the big dance.” Although Blitzer attempted to press Priebus for more specific details on how Trump is preparing for the debate, the RNC chair would not budge, saying he “didn’t want to get into all those details,” and changing the conversation to discuss the Clinton campaign instead. The Trump-Clinton debate will be at Hofstra University in Hempstead, NY Monday night at 9:00 PM EST and will be broadcast across all the major networks. It is expected to be the most viewed television debate of all time, and could reach up to 100 million viewers, almost certainly affecting the outcome of the November election. Donald Trump made a name for himself in the fact-free zones that were the Republican primary debates, where a group of neocons, corporate shills, and religious extremists argued over who was willing to murder more Middle Eastern people and who hated government the most. Trump thrived by being a bully, making fun of his opponents and literally talking about the size of his penis. He’s not going to be able to get away with that tonight. Watch the exchange here, courtesy of ThinkPolitics: 
It only took Seth Meyers ten minutes to blow up the gullible media for broadcasting an hour-long Trump infomercial, willfully spreading more of the Republican nominee’s outrageous lies and allowing him to twist the narrative and pretend that he hasn’t been leading the birther movement for the past five years while using the occasion to promote his new hotel. After a half an hour of free advertising, Trump finally tossed the media the bone they were waiting for, a thirty second statement with no apology that FALSELY claimed that Hillary Clinton started the birther movement in the first place. You don’t peddle racist rhetoric for five years and then decide when it’s over. We decide when it’s over. And it’s certainly not over after a thirty second statement in a thirty minute hotel commercial. He’s right. Donald Trump is a shameless birther, a man who spent half a decade making racist claims about President Obama long past any rational point of interest, questioning the President’s birthplace and religion for the sake of personal attention within the bigot wing of the Republican Party. Anyone naïve enough to believe that Donald Trump isn’t a hate-mongering politician merely must look at that thirty second statement, which was immediately followed by the a concentrated effort by the Trump campaign to gaslight the country and claim innocence while blaming Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. “I’m not sure the guy who holds fake press conferences, has a fake university, a fake foundation, fake hair, and a fake tan, should be in charge of deciding what’s real!” rips Meyers. But it’s a crock of lies, and Seth Meyers called out the Republican nominee for knowingly pulling the hotel commercial stunt which Trump admitted in a tweet. Meyers pointed out that even CNN’s anchors thought Donald Trump was full of crap while their infomercial was rolling, but they didn’t cut or break away and kept letting the Republican candidate hawk his hotel anyway. Meyers then rips into Trump surrogate and disgraced New Jersey governor Chris Christie for defending Trump while prosecutors are accusing him of orchestrating the “Bridgegate scandal.”The traditional “objective” style of coverage with it’s he said-she said equivalence is not capable of aptly conveying the factual reality of the gushing sewer of falsehoods that is Donald Trump. We who write here seek to ably analyze the news from a reasonable person’s point of view and present to you our readers what has actually occurred with a transparent written analysis of events based on the solid and established facts at hand in our detailed stories. It’s about time that the media quit giving a free pass to Trump and his lying pack of surrogates, scoundrels and birthers. If they remind the entire country daily that the Republican nominee is a racist birther for at least 30 seconds of each political news program daily, maybe it would help make up for the three billion dollars in free advertising they’ve already gifted to his vile campaign of hatred. Watch it here: 
The first presidential debate was Monday and letâs just say that Donald Trump had a bad night. One of the GOP candidateâs easiest lies to expose was his insistence that âstop and friskâÂ wasnât ruled unconstitutional. Heâs wrong, it absolutely was. Debate moderator Lester Holt asked Trump about his recent arguments in favor of âstop and friskâ and mentioned that the court has declared the practice unconstitutional on the grounds that it is discriminatory. ââStop and friskâ was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men â â Trump cut Holt off mid-sentence:Â âNo, youâre wrong. It went before a judge who was a very against police judge. It was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal.â Factcheck:Â U.S. District Court Judge Shira A. Scheindlin ruled âstop and friskâ to be unconstitutionalÂ August 12, 2013.Â According to the Center for Constitutional Rights,Â âJudge Shira Scheindlin found the NYPDâs practices to violate New Yorkers âFourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and also found that the practices were racially discriminatory in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment,â The Bloomberg administration did appeal the ruling. The order was then suspended by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and the case was sent back to be tried againÂ with a new judge presiding over the proceedings. However, the court shot down the cityâs motion and decided not to vacateÂ Scheindlinâs decision. The appeal was eventually dropped byÂ the de Blasio administration. Trump, who has run a bigoted campaign right from the start, was completely undeterred by Holtâs assertion of the facts and continued to argue vehemently in favor of the discriminatory policing practice. Watch Trump wrongly argue that âstop and friskâ wasnât ruled unconstitutional, even though it was, here:  
The LA Times/USC Daily Tracking Poll began reporting results on July 10. Daily poll numbers represent an average of randomly sampled polling if a control group over the prior seven days. These data provide interesting perspectives of the presidential race not readily noted by just following changes in the daily poll numbers. Here are a few of those perspectives based on data up to and including September 20: These observations reveal that since August 13 there has been a steady movement in support from Clinton to Trump. Daily Averages Since August 13 Looking at averages to date since August 13, Figure 1 shows a net swing in poll averages of 6% (from 4.7% in favor of Clinton on August 13 to 1.3% in favor of Trump on September 20). A logarithmic trend best fits the history of daily averages and suggests the slow and steady trend in favor of Trump will likely continue.

Tony Stewart is still fighting to remain in the Chase, and so far it doesn’t look very promising. Tony Stewart has had an interesting season to say the least. What started out not very promising thanks to a back injury has now turned into him being in the running towards a championship. Over the years Smoke has been involved in many controversial things. From being accused and admitting to wrecking people intentionally to being involved with a man being hit on the track, resulting in the end of his life. Overall, Tony has seen some pretty harsh things. And that can take a toll on a guy. However, he still manages to give back to people in the most amazing ways!  In a recent event, it looks like Smoke’s giving saved a life. According to a racing team first responder, Jay Masur, Tony Stewart’s lending of equipment saved his life. Masur has been a first responder for years. He’s seen first hand just how dangerous racing is. He’s also been in instances where Tony Stewart is the one he’s responding to. Now it looks like the roles have reversed. Masur was responding to an incident on a dirt track when he lost control of his four wheeler, causing him to fly off into the air and on the ground.  Now you may be wondering where Tony Stewart fits into all of this. A few years before this incident, Masur responded to one of Smoke’s wrecks and reportedly saved his life. That’s how Tony felt at least. So after everything was said and done, Smoke bought Masur and his team top of the line equipment. That equipment, including a helmet, is what Masur claims saved his life. “I believe I swerved to miss something and flew off the four wheeler and ended up hitting my head pretty hard. I believe this helmet probably saved my life, there’s no doubt. We all feel like, we’re bullet proof, we all feel, in the jobs we do, it can’t happen to us, because we’re pretty good at our stuff, but no matter how much we prepare, how much we plan, things happen, and at the end of the day, love your family, treat every day like it’s the last day on earth, because it may be. We saved [Tony’s] life and I truly believe he had a huge part in saving mine.” WOW! That’s amazing. Tony has yet to speak out about this incident, but we can only imagine how he feels. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Jay Masur and his family as he continues to heal from this incident!   
A police officer in Louisiana fighting murder charges in the death of a 6-year-old boy with autism is pleading self-defense, saying he feared for his life. In late 2015, Norris Greenhouse, Jr., 24, and Lt. Derrick Stafford, 32, of the Marksville, Louisiana police department, opened fire on Christopher Few’s car while his young son, Jeremy Mardis, was strapped in the front seat. While Few survived the injuries sustained from the gunshots, Mardis was killed at the scene. Because Few was backing his car toward the officers, attorneys representing Stafford say his indictments for second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder should be dropped as he was in fear for his life. “A review of the indictment by the court would show that the state does not state any allegations of fact that would satisfy the essential element of specific intent for the offenses charged whereby trier of fact could support a conviction,” Stafford’s attorneys wrote to the court. In body camera video of the shooting, which has still not been publicly released after nearly a year, prosecutors with the Louisiana Attorney General’s office say Greenhouse and Stafford fired on Few’s car from a “safe distance,” even while Few had his hands in the air in a plea to stop the officers from firing on his vehicle. This isn’t Stafford’s first brush with criminal charges. In 2011, he was charged with raping two women in Rapides Parish — an 18-year-old girl, and a 16-year-old girl on her birthday. The charges were dropped in 2012. Both Stafford and Greenhouse are facing separate trials for their charges. Stafford will stand trial on November 28, and Greenhouse’s trial is scheduled for March 2017. Louisiana state district judge William Bennett will hear Stafford’s argument to quash the indictment next Wednesday.        
Ambassador Chris Stevens’ former fiancée, Lydie Denier, said that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton resigned because she knew just how badly she had bungled the Benghazi debacle. “She was at the top at the time; she was the secretary of state,” Denier told Newsmax. “What I always wondered is suddenly she decided to quit her job as secretary of state earlier than people were expecting.” Denier addressed Benghazi and its aftermath in a new book, “A Voice for Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens,” commemorating the sacrifice of Stevens and the other Americans who died in the attack on the American diplomatic compound in September of 2012. She speculated as to the cause of Clinton’s departure from office: “Did someone tell her, ‘Listen, you made a big boo-boo and you have to get out?’ That subject has never been brought to the public.” Understandably, she said that Hillary Clinton can’t be trusted for the country — she certainly proved that she couldn’t handle the one situation that claimed the life of Denier’s fiancee. “If we cannot trust her for Americans, how can we trust her for the whole country? It doesn’t make sense. In my book, I do talk about that and about what happened … Chris was and knew, was extremely knowledgeable about Libya and what was going on. He should’ve been listened to,” said Denier. The book also took time to celebrate who Stevens was as a person. His fiancée understandably remembered him fondly. “The Chris Stevens I knew was fun and loving, caring, always putting others in front of everything instead of himself,” she said. Ultimately, Steven gave his life for his country — but he shouldn’t have had to. Please share this on Facebook and Twitter and let us know what you think of Stevens, Hillary Clinton and Benghazi.

While Charlotte, North Carolina faces a state of emergency and unarmed black people continue to get shot dead by police, Mike Pence has a few words to say regarding the mounting racial tensions gripping this nation. To him, it’s annoying — but not in the way one might think. As black people — who have done nothing wrong that warranted getting killed — lie dead in the street, Pence and Trump are annoyed hearing about it. How do we know? Because Pence was *smart* enough to admit it to reporters: Trump and I believe there’s been far too much talk about institutional bias and racism within law enforcement. Gee, sorry black people dying and being targeted at disproportionate rates annoys you so much, Pence. Sorry the plight of black America is a burden to your message of “Build that Wall.” Thirty-eight percent of the U.S. population is non-white. When a third of the population can fall victim to institutional bias and racism in law enforcement, the conversation (or “talk” as Pence puts it) is extremely important. Sorry if the talk makes your uncomfortable or triggers your prejudices, but it needs to happen. Skirting it under the rug or blaming it on drug use doesn’t make it go away. The statistics tell us all we need to know: So, even with all these glaring statistics, Mike Pence thinks talking about it has been “far too much” for his and Trump’s comfort. Newsflash, Pence: you’re running for Vice President of the United States, not Vice President of the white community. If the talk is too much, get out of the race. We already know Trump doesn’t care about the black community nor does he want to actually fix anything that afflicts it, but Pence was supposed to give the illusion that a potential Trump Administration would care. That’s been shattered. Good luck getting the black vote in November when you completely wish to disregard what hurts them the most: systemic racism. 
A public high school has been accused of indoctrinated Islam into their students. Allegedly, the school has been mandating children profess the Islamic statement of faith, memorize the five pillars of Islam, as well as teaching students that the Muslims faith is stronger than a Christian or Jews. This is all according to lawsuit filed in federal court this past Wednesday. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of John and Melissa Wood with the Thomas More Law Center and the action is being taken against La Plata High School in Maryland. According to John Wood the school banished him from their property when he complained about the Islamic teachings. Richard Thompson, President of Thomas More, said, “Defendants forced Wood’s daughter to disparage her Christian faith by reciting the Shahada, and acknowledging Mohammed as her spiritual leader.” The Law Center commented that for non Muslims such as Christians and Jews that reciting the Shahada Islamic creed which is their statement of faith is the equivalent of converting. Spokespeople for the Charles County Public Schools have refused to comment other than to say they have not received any such lawsuit yet. However, the Principal Evelyn Arnold, Vice Principal Shannon Morris, and Charles County Board of Education were all named in the lawsuit. The lawsuit says, “During its brief instruction on Christianity, Defendants failed to cover any portion of the Bible or other non-Islamic religious texts, such as the Ten Commandments. Instead, the class included disparaging remarks about Christianity and the Pope. Such discriminatory treatment of Christianity is an unconstitutional promotion of one religion over another. United States Supreme Court precedent does not create a double standard that allows for the promotion of Islam in our public schools while disallowing and silencing teachings of Christianity and Judaism.” Classroom assignment copies indicate the teachers were instructing students that most Muslim people’s faith are stronger than that of the average Christian. As well, the copies show they taught students that Islam is a peaceful religion that treated their conquered nations with kindness and respect too. Part of the handout reads, “Nowhere in the Koran does it say you will go to paradise if you martyr yourself with a suicide bomb. Important: The majority of Muslims do not live this way.” It referenced the jihad as, “a holy war waged on behalf of Islam as a religious duty; a personal struggle in devotion to Islam especially involving spiritual discipline.” This reportedly occurred during the 2014-2015 school year. So lord only knows what these teachers have been education these students about for the past few years. Despite the fact the Thomas More Center has taken on this case neither the American Civil Liberties Union or the Freedom From Religion Foundation have weighed in on the issue.       
Next week’s debate may be the nation’s most widely watched Presidential debate in YEARS. That is, if both participants actually bother to show up.  Trump-enthusiast and Gateway Pundit owner Jim Hoft published an article today in which he says that an unnamed “conservative leader” contacted him stating that Hillary may be pulling out of Monday’s debate. Now this… A conservative leader wrote The Gateway Pundit Wednesday morning to share this news: Hearing smart guys say that Hillary may cancel the debate on Monday … Hillary may be trying to run out the clock because she thinks she is ahead. Could it be that Hillary Clinton pulls out of the debate, or is this just propaganda for Trump? Or even, a way to garner more interest for the much-awaited debate between the Republican and Democratic Presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton? With the widely-publicized health problems facing the Democratic nominee, it may very well be that she faces a “medical emergency” just before she is slated to take the stage. What do you think is the legitimacy of these whisperings? 
Like much of the mainstream media, the Washington Post is going out of its way to disparage Donald Trump. But the Post isn’t satisfied with the normal biased reporting—they have gone above and beyond assigning 20 reporters just to dig up dirt on the Republican nominee. That must have failed because now they are taking the lazy, but disgusting way out with inappropriate Hitler references. Twice in this month Post columnists have compared Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. Perhaps the editors have designated September as “Trump Is Hitler Month” at the Washington Post. On Monday they featured a column by Richard Cohen which said in part, (…) while Trump is neither an anti-Semite nor does he have designs on neighboring countries, he is Hitlerian in his thinking. He thinks the truth is what he says it is. Mr. Cohen didn’t mention what despot Hillary’s lies reminded him of, but then again the post would never have a “Hillary is Hitler month.” While a Hillary comparison would be just as wrong, the fact that they are only creating a “Trump” month is incredibly sexist. Six Day’s before Mr. Cohen, another columnist  Shalom Auslander wrote, “Don’t compare Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler.

Republican nominee Donald Trump got thoroughly outplayed by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton during the debate tonight, only capable of blustering and babbling in response to her cool and measured fact-based statements. Whether it was crime, national security, the economy, trade, or his own tax returns, Trump was on the defensive the entire night, unable to overcome the consequences of his own selfish decisions and the weaknesses of the incoherent rambles that pass for policy positions for the Republican nominee. Immediately after the debate, Trump rolled out a pathetic excuse for his own failures tonight.  Trump is relentlessly sticking to this ridiculous notion that the system is “rigged” against him, refusing to admit that he’s shot himself in the foot so many times that the vast majority of the American people will be unwilling to support a rabble-rousing racist with an extensive history of shady business practices. Not only is it a shameful refusal to admit his own mistakes, but it’s an existential attack on our entire democracy. His mic was clearly not defective, since he continuously interrupted both moderator Lester Holt and Secretary Clinton tonight and didn’t back down off from failed attempts to take cheap shots at the Democratic nominee. His childish behavior tonight illustrates that he is temperamentally unfit to be the President of the United States, and this pitiful response is just the cherry on the cake.
It definitely wouldn’t be all that surprising if George H.W. Bush is voting for Hillary Clinton. After all, his son Jeb didn’t do all that well during the primary campaign, and in a show of opposition to Donald Trump, no one in the Bush clan showed up at the Republican National Convention for Trump’s coronation. The Bushes themselves have remained mum on the subject of whom they’re voting for. In fact, they’ve pretty much stayed out of the presidential race altogether. But one insider says the elder Bush of 92 years will be casting his vote for the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. That insider is one of the late Robert F. Kennedy’s daughters, Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend. She is a former Democratic lieutenant governor of Maryland. On Monday, she posted a picture of her shaking hands with Bill Clinton’s predecessor with the caption: “The President told me he’s voting for Hillary!!”  According to Politico, Kennedy Townsend was visiting with the former President at his Maine summer home on Walker’s Point in Kennebunkport. Later in a phone interview with Politico, the Kennedy daughter confirmed, “That’s what he said.” But when pressed about it, a spokesman for Bush would neither confirm nor deny. In an email to Politico, Jim McGrath wrote, “The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days. He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim.” Politico noted that George H.W. Bush wouldn’t be the first from his or his son’s administration to be voting for Hillary – or at least not voting for the Donald: “Many former GOP officials from both Bush administrations have also announced their support for Clinton over Trump, including national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez.”    The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.
In the last 24 years, we have had both Republican and Democrat presidents. Republican and Democrat Congressmen and Senators differ on many things, but they agree that the market should be flooded with Chinese merchandise, that our American factories should close, and that American workers should be laid off. It is harder to find products that are made in America. When we go to a store, Chinese-made merchandise floods the aisles. Wow, they are smart politicians. They did the thinking on behalf of the American public. They decided that this is how it should be. It seems that American voters really don’t have a say. Elect whomever you want to elect. Let the conservatives and the liberals beat the heck out of each other, and let the voters cheer whomever they like. What do they tell the voters about the trade policies that they sign? Why are these agreements kept locked up behind closed doors? Why is it that no one knows the details of these agreements until after the bills have been voted on and passed? Did they ask the voters if the trade agreements should be signed? Did they ask the voters if the agreements should be revoked or at least modified? The Elite Businessmen have to make more money, even at the expense of American industry, and the free trade agreements are their sacred texts.

Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years. I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good. The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity: Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014. Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.    The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.
This should come as no surprise to most of us, but Trump supporter Don King let the âN-wordâ slip out during a recent speech in an Ohio Church. Itâs also unlikely that youâll be surprised at the fact that Trump was sitting right behind him, smiling with glee when it happened. Trump LOVED hearing the âN-wordâ (screenshot) CNN commentator Angela RyeÂ spoke about this terrible incident with a Trump supporter, and the racism behind the Trump campaign got even worse. When Rye asked white Trump surrogate Joseph Borelli to âPlease tell me that you understandâ how offensive it was to use the âN-wordâ in 2016, she didnât quite get the answer she was hoping for. In fact, it was the exact opposite. The white panelist basically said that since rappers use the âN-wordâ, itâs fair game for Don King and everyone else. Borelli said: âHave you not listened to music where other African-Americans use language far worse than this?â Rye couldnât believe her ears, andÂ gave Borelli a chance to save himself as she begged, âPlease donât do that to me. Please donât do that to me, today.â And of course, the dense Trump supporter didnât take the hint: âI am going to do it, though. You canât say that Don King is saying a word that is now suddenly unacceptable. Itâs not one that I would use, but itâs perhaps a word that Don King would use.â Thatâs when Rye went off and tore him a new one. In making her point, Rye warned, âWhat Iâm saying to you,Â is this trivializes your candidateâs black outreach.â You can watch Rye shred Borelli below: @CorporateBarbie@metroadlib RT @keithboykin: .@angela_rye for the win! #DonKingpic.twitter.com/otd8owrCU7 â Thanks for Asking (@ykesha2001) September 21, 2016 Rye also didnât hesitate to point out the fact that Trump was smirking during the âN-wordâ-heavy speech, which will undoubtedly create more trust issues with African American voters: .@angela_rye on Trump surrogate using the N word during a minority outreach event https://t.co/fVy4GUzMZU â Eugene Scott (@Eugene_Scott) September 21, 2016  
CNN recently ran an article titled, “Donald Trump defends racial profiling in wake of bombs.” Now, let’s first ignore the fact that once again, CNN is more upset over how we talk about the terror suspect and his religious affiliation than the fact that he allegedly set off bombs intended to hurt people and shot at cops during his capture. CNN claims Trump “reiterated his support for the controversial practice of racial profiling by police amid increasing threats to the homeland.” Translation: Donald Trump is a RAAAAAAACIST!  But here’s the thing. Trump never even mentioned racial profiling. He was praising Israel’s extraordinary vetting methods, which involves profiling, especially at the airport. And guess what? It works for them. “Our police are amazing. Our local police — they know who a lot of these people are. They are afraid to do anything about it because they don’t want to be accused of profiling and they don’t want to be accused of all sorts of things,” Trump said. “You know, in Israel they profile. They’ve done an unbelievable job, as good as you can do. But Israel has done an unbelievable job, and they’ll profile. They see somebody that’s suspicious, they will profile. They will take that person and they’ll check out,” he continued. “Do we have a choice? Look what’s going on. Do we really have a choice? We’re trying to be so politically correct in our country. And this is only going to get worse.” Profiling doesn’t necessarily mean racial profiling. CNN completely made that up, because they want to advance the false narrative that Trump’s a giant racist. CNN even admitted that Trump didn’t actually say “racial” profiling in that very article. Trump did not say on what attributes he would encourage police to profile possible suspects, but it’s illegal for police to subject US persons to disparate treatment based on their race or other protected status. So Trump “did not say on what attributes he would encourage police to profile possible suspects,” but in the VERY FIRST PARAGRAPH, CNN definitively claims that he “reiterated his support for the controversial practice of racial profiling by police.” They made a claim and basically debunked it two paragraphs later. In what world is that considered fair and balanced reporting?
Not reading enough off-the-wall news? Well, boy howdy, do I have a story for you. If you know anything about mice and rats, you know that they don’t exactly live out in the open. They rely on small spaces and dark paths for the bulk of their travel. some of these small, dark spaces include the pipes of your toilets. We’ve all seen videos of rats in toilets and you have to admit, it would be pretty frightening to stumble tiredly into your bathroom in the middle of the night and find a large rodent staring back at your from your porcelain throne.  See what I mean? Who wants to find that? Here is a video that shows how simple it is for these guys to climb up into your toilet.   If you live in a place that is rife with these furry menaces, there is something you can do to prevent them from disturbing your bathroom time. To keep rats away, install sewer pipes made of PVC or clay, at least 24 inches wide. Place a one-way rat baffle (a cap, basically), in the pipeline. And make sure any rubbish and drains are tightly sealed to stop rats congregating near your house in the first place. If you can’t do that, because you live in an apartment or some such accommodation, call your plumber and let them know you’re having rat problems and see if they can help you. 
I watched both shootings of black men play out yesterday and I have something to say about each of them here today. The shooting in Tulsa, where I live, is being portrayed as a white cop shooting an innocent black man. Not quite. Terence Crutcher has a rap sheet a mile long. He had been arrested at least 12 times previously. They found PCP in his stalled SUV. What the media would have you believe is that he was just standing by his stalled car when the evil cops showed up and shot him while he had his arms raised. He was indeed unarmed, but as you will see in the video below, he was walking with his arms and hands raised after being told repeatedly to stop by the police. He kept on going until he got back to his car and then he started to reach in the window for something. That is when a white, female officer shot him fatally. His attorney is claiming the window was up when he arrived… it is pretty clear that the guy was reaching inside that vehicle when he was shot. Two officers fired simultaneously – one a taser and one a gun. It was a justified shooting – he was not shot with his hands up. From my viewpoint, the officer followed procedure. Was she supposed to wait and see if he pulled a gun and fired on them before shooting the guy? No, that is not how they are trained. The guy was not obeying commands and he looked high to me. Hundreds showed up in Tulsa last night to protest… it was Black Lives Matter again. Originally, people said he was a pastor… not true, he was a criminal and the officers acted in a way to protect themselves as a last resort. Now, onto North Carolina, where the black man was armed, shot and killed as well… by a black police officer.  From Gateway Pundit: Protests erupted in Charlotte, North Carolina Tuesday after 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by a police officer. The man was reportedly shot by a black officer. Protesters attacked police, hit a reporter in the head with a rock and trashed a police cruiser. The shooting occurred around 4 p.m. at The Village at College Downs apartment complex in northeast Charlotte. According to WBTV, officers said they were searching for a person with an outstanding warrant when they saw a man get out of a vehicle with a firearm. Lamont Scott got out of the vehicle “armed with a firearm and posed an imminent deadly threat to the officers who subsequently fired their weapon striking the subject.” Black Lives Matter activists gathered tonight to protest the shooting. They’re hurling water bottles at police. Twelve police officers were injured last night as hundreds of Black Lives Matter protesters rioted and looted after Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by a police officer in Charlotte. His daughter is circulating a video claiming he was innocent of course… a father of seven, reading in his car and waiting for his son to get home from school and that he was unarmed. That’s touching, but it’s not reality according to the police and just as in Tulsa, I’m far more willing to believe the police here than BLM. According to officers, they were looking for a suspect when they came across Scott in his car. They were in plain clothes and ordered Scott out of his car. He got out with a gun and then got back in. He got out a second time still with his gun in hand and they took him down because he was an armed threat. A gun was recovered from the scene. Several hundred rioters went to town last night in Charlotte. They threw bricks and water bottles at the police. The police lobbed tear gas at the rioters. The BLM asshats stole cargo off trucks and set fire to it in the middle of the street. They tried to loot a Walmart and were pushed back by police. They destroyed two police vehicles and assaulted the media. They set trucks on fire as well. “We out like the Taliban!” one rioter could be heard crying on a Facebook Live broadcast of the protests, shortly after tear gas canisters were fired into the crowd. After 11 pm, the situation grew more severe, with several people successfully trashing a police SUV. The police also used flash grenades to disperse the crowds. I didn’t see any, but I’ll bet pepper spray was used as well. Some protesters were heard yelling ‘Black Lives Matter!’ and ‘Hands up, don’t shoot!’. They held up a sign saying ‘Stop Killing Us!’ and ‘It was a book!’, making reference to the object Scott was reportedly holding when he was shot dead. Officer Brentley Vinson – a former college football player – was identified as the officer who shot Scott, WCCB reports. Officer Vinson, who has worked at the department since July of 2014 and is also black, has been placed on paid on administrative leave, as is standard procedure in such cases. What you are seeing is a ginned up race war with cop-hatred for fuel. Both of these incidents were justified and the police were doing their jobs. If you do not obey a police officer repeatedly, you are going to get shot. If you have a gun and brandish it at them, you are going to get shot. Black Lives Matter is a radical, racist terrorist group and its members should be treated as such.       For context, the shooting of Terence Crutcher:

To say that the relationship between Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan is a bit tepid would be nothing short of an understatement. Nevertheless, for all of their differences that have been repeatedly highlighted by the liberal media, Ryan has endorsed Trump over Democrat rival Hillary Clinton, and that didn’t change following Monday night’s presidential debate. According to Politico, Ryan broke from some other seemingly disappointed Republicans on Capitol Hill to offer high praise for Trump’s debate performance. “I saw Donald Trump give a spirited voice to those of us who don’t like the status quo, and I see emerging in front of us the potential for what a unified Republican government can get you, which can be the solutions,” Ryan stated Tuesday morning at a press conference. “I think he passed a number of thresholds … and showed that for 90 minutes he could go toe-to-toe with Hillary Clinton,” he added. Other GOP members thought Trump could have done better, though, and several lamented the many “missed opportunities” where Trump could have landed damaging blows against Clinton over a host of problem issues for her — except that he didn’t even take a swing. Nevertheless, Trump was not hung out to dry by his fellow Republicans after the debate, and the high praise from Ryan showed that at least some in the GOP establishment have apparently come to terms with Trump as potentially the next president. In other words, don’t believe all the stories about disunity from a left-leaning media that fears victory by a consolidated Republican Party. Please share this on Facebook and Twitter so that everyone can see what Speaker of the House Paul Ryan had to say about Donald Trump following the first presidential debate.

The United Kingdom began construction on what is being called their “great wall” near the border at Calais, France. The wall is being built to prevent illegal migrants from jumping onto vehicles preparing to cross the English Channel. The wall will cost an estimated two million pounds — about $2.5 million — and will be approximately 13 feet high.   There is a nearby migrant camp called “the Jungle” that has been attacking vehicles in an attempt to climb aboard lorries and cars in order to enter the United Kingdom. The wall will be made out of concrete, which is more difficult to climb and will be extended by fences. The “Jungle” now has more than 10,000 migrants and it has become a hotspot for violence. Police have called that area of Calais a “no-go” zone after dark, due to the endemic violence in the area. The migrants have been known to cause car crashes, leave debris on the road, thrown rocks off of bridges and started fires. They have also physically attacked drivers with bats, stabbed them with knives and even threatened people with chainsaws.   It is these attacks that encouraged Calais port chief executive Jean-Marc Puissesseau to support the wall. “This wall is going to prevent migrants from getting onto the road every night,” he said. “We can no longer continue to put up with these repeated assaults.” Liberals in the United Kingdom predictably opposed the construction of the wall, comparing it to the policies of Donald Trump. However, they don’t offer any other alternatives to deal with the problems. Thankfully, the British government, along with the French, are not going to allow this kind of violence to continue. 
I love a story with a happy ending! When a Palestinian teenager attempted to lure an Israeli soldier into an ambush, the last thing he probably expected was to be shot down before he could carry out his fatal plan. It makes me all warm and fuzzy inside.  If there’s one thing you need to know about Israeli soldiers, male and female, it’s that they are trained to know the moves you are going to make before you even think about making them. They are faced with life and death situations every single day, because they live in the most dangerous area in the world and have been targeted by Palestinians and Muslims around the world for as long as anyone can remember. Apparently this 16 year-old didn’t know what you and I know, and it was the very last mistake he ever made. A surveillance camera captured the 21-second event where Issa Tarayra – as identified by the Palestinian Health Ministry – approached an IDF soldier before attempting to stab him. Forces responded to the threat immediately and put the young man down. Luckily nobody but Tarayra was harmed, as the soldier that was targeted had managed to duck out of the way of the knife just in time. Watch the video below, but be aware that while it’s not extremely graphic footage, it may be considered shocking to some. Viewer discretion is advised:   According to The Daily Mail, this is the ninth attack of its kind since the end of the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha and ahead of October’s Jewish holidays. I can’t say I feel too terribly bad for the kid, who decided to risk his life on one stupid act. One less scumbag in the world and good riddance. 
As most of our readers are well aware, there has been immense speculation recently regarding the health status of Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Following in the wake of Clinton’s near collapse at the 9/11 memorial service earlier this month, some have suggested that Clinton may be suffering from some sort of neurological disorder that is causing her to have dizzy spells and difficulty walking or standing, particularly when dealing with steps. There is sure to be renewed speculation in that regard following a bit of video that emerged Sunday via a Twitter post from Clinton pool reporter and ABC News journalist Liz Kreutz, who happened to catch Clinton as she was leaving a building in New York City, according to the Conservative Treehouse. Clinton was exiting the Appleseeds Kids Center and preparing to descend a set of stairs when Kreutz approached, camera rolling, and began to ask questions of the candidate.  Clinton just left "Apple Seeds" kids center in Flatiron. Feeling good about debate? "Getting ready, getting ready!" pic.twitter.com/mXxBbMiVcu — Liz Kreutz (@ABCLiz) September 25, 2016  As can be seen in the video, Clinton seemingly ignored the reporter’s first questions, instead remaining intently focused on grabbing the handrail and her footing on the steps as she descended. Once she was about three-quarters of the way down the stairs, only then did Clinton turn her attention to the reporter, flashing a sudden smile but continuing to ignore the questions, replying with only “Getting ready” when pressed about her preparedness for the first presidential debate Monday evening. She then carefully hoisted herself up into her special campaign van, without any assistance, though a Secret Service agent stood ready to perhaps lend a hand right behind her. While it is entirely plausible that Clinton didn’t see or hear the reporter until she had reached the bottom of the steps, this video clip will likely still serve as further proof that she is suffering from some sort of medical issues that make it difficult for her to walk up and down stairs. The video certainly reinforces the supposition that Clinton suffers from selective hearing, picking and choosing which questions she will acknowledge and answer while ignoring others that may prove difficult or too revealing for her. Please share this on Facebook and Twitter so that everyone can see Hillary Clinton seemingly struggle in her effort to successfully descend a flight of stairs, so much so that she virtually ignored a reporter standing and watching in close proximity. What do you think of the apparently extra-careful manner in which Hillary Clinton was spotted descending a small set of stairs? Scroll down to comment below!
Rioters have taken over Charlotte, North Carolina. The situation has become so bad that Governor Pat McCrory has declared a state of emergency and called in the National Guard. One person isn’t having it though and that’s Sheriff David Clarke. Nicknamed “America’s Sheriff,” Clarke is known for his commonsense approach to controversial issues and his politically incorrect devotion to telling it like it is. Sheriff Clarke was on Stuart Varney’s show on the Fox Business Network and weighed in on the riots in Charlotte, and he hit the nail right on the head. Clarke completely rejected the idea that the rioters were actually protesters trying to combat racial injustice. “This has become a political construct and I said that four months in December of 2014 after Ferguson,” Clarke said. “I know these people, I know what they’re up to, I know their mode. These are anarchists! The anarchists are exploiting these poor people in these urban ghettos to be the riot starters so until the police commanders start to understand what this movement is – all they have to do is go back to the war on cops in the 60’s.”  Riots in Charlotte. @SheriffClarke: these are anarchists… a soft approach from police just won't work. #VarneyCo pic.twitter.com/brFSeCOH4B — Varney & Co. (@Varneyco) September 21, 2016   He also called on police to stop handling these rioters with kid gloves. According to Clarke, police must act more aggressively to stop the violent activists before it gets out of control. And the situation in Charlotte is truly out of control. In addition to blocking highways and looting businesses, the rioters have turned violent. They were smashing windows and setting fire to businesses. At least one person has been killed and multiple police officers have been injured. They even began attacking the media, which has largely been sympathetic to their cause. A CNN reporter was body-slammed live on air and the rioters tried to kill a photographer by throwing him into a fire. But the violence didn’t end there. After a black man shot another protester, demonstrators began throwing bottles, dirt clods and fireworks at the officers. The police fired flash grenades and then tear gas back, dispersing the crowd of several hundred. Protesters responded by hurling trash cans and potted plants. This is not about protesting the death of an allegedly innocent person. This is a bunch of thugs exploiting someone’s death for their own nefarious purposes. 
Charlotte has seen some of the worst rioting over a cop shooting in a while and regardless of what the liberal media labels these people, they are not protesters. Protesters have a right to protest. They are protected under the Constitution. No. These folks we have here are rioters. They have burned, smashed, looted and now murdered each other over the latest police shooting (by the way, the officer was black).  Justin Carr, 26, passed away on Thursday after being critically wounded during the riots over the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by a black police officer. Carr was shot as rioters fought with police in riot gear lined arm-in-arm standing guard at the Omni Hotel at about 8:30 pm. City officials say Carr was not shot by an officer, but some protesters have claimed that he was wounded by a cop. No arrests have been made in Carr’s death, but a homicide investigation has been launched.  Police Chief Kerr Putney has put detectives on the case to try and find out who it was that made the shot, while the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice have other plans… ‘I saw the man go down on the pavement,’ Minister Steve Knight of Mission gathering Christian Church in Charlotte said. ‘It was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.’ Of course. Rioters are burning, looting and beating people, and it’s the cops. These people are pathetic. Knight also claimed: ‘We would like to see surveillance video from the surrounding area that may have captured the shooting to determine who was responsible for the shooting.’ Justin Carr is dead. Shot in the head. Does this sound like a peaceful protest? Well, it’s not one I’m familiar with. Is there any reasoning or waiting for the facts anymore?   
The Benghazi fiasco and subsequent lie trail that Hillary Clinton has left in her wake is something I’m sure she wishes would just go away. Luckily, we have patriots all across this great nation that will make sure that never happens. Take this kid for example. His name is Mason and unlike most students his age, he is a conservative through and through. It’s evidenced by his awesome anti-Hillary t-shirt he wore to school. He and his teacher, who is a Liberal (surprise), routinely engaged in political conversations. What happened next is pure awesomeness.   A young man by the name of Mason wore his “Hillary for Prison 2016” shirt to high school one day, which caught the attention of one of his liberal teachers. According to his father’s proud Facebook post, it’s a pro-Hillary teacher whom Mason regularly talks politics with. But during this particular exchange, the teacher got an unexpected, yet, totally epic response. His father sets the scene: So…Mason wore his “Hillary for Prison 2016” shirt to school today. One of his Clinton-supporting teachers whom he’s has political discussions with asked, “Did you wear that for me?” His reply, “No, for Chris Stevens.” Mic drop. Boom! Nice job, Mason! That’s how you stand up to liberal indoctrinators, sometimes known as teachers. Christopher Stevens, of course, was the U.S. Ambassador to Libya that perished in Benghazi on Hillary Clinton’s watch.  This story originated from a Facebook post, but it’s since been taken down. We imagine that Mason and his family didn’t want the publicity, but to be honest, they SHOULD. The liberals tend to act all high and mighty about things like this and showing your conservatism should be celebrated by you, your family, and all other conservatives. Mason, we salute you and hope you continue to show what it truly means to be a patriot in the face of all the lies and hate. (Source: Truth Revolt) h/t Allen B. West 
You’ve got to be freaking kidding me. This is just simply unbelievable. Not only was the Hildabeast’s IT guy granted immunity, they gave immunity to Cheryl Mills and two other staff members. No wonder they couldn’t convict her. The revelations of the immunity granted left Republicans in utter shock. Then they got furious, but I guess they got out-maneuvered on this one. I told you these people aren’t stupid. There were a myriad of ways that Mills herself violated the law or at a minimum assisted Clinton in skirting it. In the New York Post earlier this month, Paul Sperry bluntly accused Mills of being the evil mastermind behind the Clinton email coverup: … Mills ultimately made the determinations about which emails should be preserved before she and Clinton decided to delete the rest as “personal” … Mills was the one who ordered the server host to move the emails from the server to a laptop where she could screen them … And Mills may have been a key player in the game of hide-and-seek.  From The Federalist Papers Project: Another top aide to Hillary Rodham Clinton was granted immunity by President Barack Obama’s Department of JusticeInjustice during the FBI’s investigation into the former Secretary of State’s use of a private email server, reported theAssociated Press. Specifically, the FBI provided Clinton’s former chief of Staff, Cheryl Mills, and two other staff members with immunity. The bombshell revelation reportedly left congressional Republicans in utter shock. “No wonder they couldn’t prosecute a case,” remarked Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. “They were handing out immunity deals like candy.” Consider also why the FBI granted immunity — to procure more evidence to use against Secretary Clinton. Yet the Department ultimately failed to acquire enough evidence to pursue charges against her, as Director James Comey tried to explain two months ago:   Every official in and out of the FBI involved in this whole investigation should be brought to account for this and should at the very least, lose their jobs, if not go to prison. According to the final House Benghazi Committee Report released three months ago, as reported by Politico, Mills also tainted “the findings of an internal State Department review of the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack.” Why in the hell would you grant this woman immunity? Oh, I know why! You never had any intention of prosecuting ANYONE involved. Instead the FBI was so corrupt they handed out immunity deals like candy and everyone walked. The FBI is no longer viable. They need to be gutted and rebooted. Seriously. 
Obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N. Assembly. During it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups in Syria and otherwise. He spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his "JV team." Seeing as the U.S. is the global police force, he said that we have no chance of winning this battle. The Daily Caller reports that Obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the Islamic State group. He cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution. "If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long," said Obama. President Obama continued by saying that we must "be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy." He mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the Islamic State group he also categorized Syria as "a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won." Instead Obama suggested that we "pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect." Which may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable' people to try to deal with.  It's likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical Islam and death and violence. These are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a Christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected Muslim terrorist. It's this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today. Pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some JV team get's us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse. It's about time we start calling it like it is and taking action. We're past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. If we don't take action soon, then Obama's pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality. Make sure to share this on Facebook if you think it's time we take action against the very real threat that is radical Islam. Source: Conservative Tribune  Tags: ISIS, Obama
It’s no secret that Russia is very pro-Donald Trump, and Donald Trump is extremely pro-Russia. His policies align with Russia’s Christmas list, and he hired – for a campaign manager – a man who benefited heavily from pro-Russian monies during the Ukrainian conflict. In fact, the ties between Paul Manafort and Russian oligarchs became so widely known that it caused his premature departure from the campaign, prompting many questions to be raised. The Trump campaign thought this would all be behind them in no time. But, as usual, they were wrong. On Friday, it was a announced that U.S. intelligence officials are investigating Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser to Trump, for alleged ties to Russia. Intelligence officials have reason to believe that Page has opened up secret and backroom communications with top Russian officials in an ongoing effort to have economic sanctions lifted. According to Yahoo News, which first broke the story: The activities of Trump adviser Carter Page, who has extensive business interests in Russia, have been discussed with senior members of Congress during recent briefings about suspected efforts by Moscow to influence the presidential election, the sources said. After one of those briefings, Senate minority leader Harry Reid wrote FBI Director James Comey, citing reports of meetings between a Trump adviser (a reference to Page) and “high ranking sanctioned individuals” in Moscow over the summer as evidence of “significant and disturbing ties” between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin that needed to be investigated by the bureau. The reports apparently had some members of Congress “taken aback,” due to the overwhelming and disturbing evidence that shows these ties. Congressional members, which includes California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, fear that such ties could lead to an unfair tampering with not only U.S.-Russian relations, but undercut foreign policy and even the November presidential election. Page is a former banker who worked for Merrill Lynch and is based in Moscow, giving him strong ties with rich and influential Russian officials. In fact, one of Page’s business buddies is especially problematic for American diplomacy and international law: But U.S. officials have since received intelligence reports that during that same three-day trip, Page met with Igor Sechin, a longtime Putin associate and former Russian deputy prime minister who is now the executive chairman of Rosneft, Russian’s leading oil company, a well-placed Western intelligence source tells Yahoo News. That meeting, if confirmed, is viewed as especially problematic by U.S. officials because the Treasury Department in August 2014 named Sechin to a list of Russian officials and businessmen sanctioned over Russia’s “illegitimate and unlawful actions in the Ukraine. So now that that the Trump campaign is once again under the microscope for shady Russian ties, they did what they know best: they lied. Page has been listed as a foreign policy adviser to Trump since March. In August, Hope Hicks, spokeswoman for the campaign, confirmed that Carter was an adviser. Now? Communications director Jason Miller told The Hill that Page is “not an adviser and has made no contribution to the campaign.” So which is it? The campaign and its spokeswoman have confirmed that Page is in fact an adviser, and now their communications director says he’s not nor has he ever been. It’s becoming clearer and clearer everyday that the Trump campaign is nothing more than a puppet of the Kremlin and Putin’s rich, thuggish buddies. But no, let’s continue to talk about Hillary Clinton’s pneumonia, because that’s way more important than a potentially stolen election by the same people supporting one of the candidates. 
Very rarely does a cop’s good deed ever make it into the headlines. It’s just not provocative enough for most in the mainstream media, so they have no reason to run it. But we do. With all of the pain that Americans are facing with the riots and the hatred of men and women who are sworn to protect the public, we at Right Wing News are dedicated to balancing out the seemingly endless stream of anger.  Mark Ross wasn’t shy about admitting that he disliked police officers, but when a tragic event struck his family, an officer turned out to be the best friend he’d never expected to have. You see, Ross received a phone call that nobody ever wants to get; the call telling him that his sister had passed away after getting into a car accident. Doing what any of the rest of us would do, he hopped into a car with his friend at the wheel and they sped toward Detroit. While passing through Ohio, they were pulled over for speeding. The driver was taken to the local jail and the car was impounded. So what happened to Ross? He began explaining to the officer the reason for the traffic infraction. As he told the officer about the loss of his sister, he broke into tears and began sobbing. Instead of leaving him on the side of the road, or taking him to the closest bus stop, the officer decided to do what he knew was right. The officer reached out to Ross and prayed for him and his family. He also drove him 100 miles to the prison where his friend was being held so he could get bailed out, and to get Ross closer to Michigan. Ross posted the above photo on his Facebook page with the following message: At 3am I got a phone call stating that my sister had been killed in a car accident due to some young dumb punk! I haven’t slept and instantly got on the road. Of course we were speeding, trying to get back to Detroit. And we got pulled over in Ohio. I knew I was going to Jail due to a petty warrant. The police called Wayne county and they refused to come get me because of the distance. I explained to the officer that my sister had died and that I needed to get to my mother asap. I broke down crying and he saw the sincerity in my cry. He REACHES OVER AND BEGAN PRAYING OVER ME AND MY FAMILY. He offered to bring me 100 miles further to Detroit because they towed the vehicle. Everybody knows how much I dislike Cops but I am truly Greatful for this Guy. He gave me hope A GoFundMe has been set up to help pay for his sister’s funeral expenses. If you have an extra dollar hanging around, please consider donating it to this family in this time of grief. 
Let’s go eat all of the Skittles and send the empty packages to Donald Trump’s unfortunately named son. Because the candy metaphor he posted to Twitter today in order to demonize Syrian immigrants is worthy of great mockery. Trump Jr. posted a image of a bowl of Skittles and asked if anyone would eat them if he said three were poisoned. Somehow, that’s what the Syrian immigrant “problem” is like. This image says it all.

This is just disgraceful. Texas… you can do better than this. A judge took to Facebook to vent her feelings after seeing a police officer named Sgt. Demetrick Pennie sue Black Lives Matter and others for causing disparagement of police and causing racial division. He also charges their actions led to the deaths of five officers in Dallas and others across the country. For that, this judge called him a clueless slave. Others on her Facebook page called him derogatory names and went to town on the officer. One of them was a Texas State Representative, if you can believe it. Sergeant Pennie recently petitioned the federal court to expedite his case due to the incoming threats received. Everything is about race now and cop-hatred. I don’t even recognize my country anymore. Andrea Martin, 304th District Court Judge in Dallas County (D), should be removed from the bench permanently. She is supposed to be non-partisan, unbiased and fair as a judge. She is obviously not. She should be reported to the state bar and held accountable.  From Breitbart: A Texas judge likened a black Dallas Police Sergeant to a clueless slave in response to the cop’s lawsuit against Black Lives Matter and its high-profile supporters. Andrea Martin, 304th District Court Judge in Dallas County (D), told her network of friends on Facebook Saturday that Sgt. Demetrick Pennie was like a slave that Harriet Tubman could not free because he could not comprehend his own bondage. The post elicited a number of supporters to Judge Martin’s sentiment, typically calling Pennie a “coon” and other derisive messages. A sitting Texas State Representative apparently joined the racialist banter as well.  Martin’s thoughts led others to compare Pennie to a “coon”, “Judas” and Samuel L. Jackson’s house slave character “Stephen” in the 2012 film, Django Unchained. The derisive comments were repeatedly cheered by Martin’s lines of “laughing-so-hard-I’m-crying” emojis and others.     Texas State Representative Eric Johnson (D – Dallas, Mesquite) also appears to join in with a “Stephen” reference via his Facebook account. Judge Martin currently serves in the 304th Juvenile District Court. She originally graduated from Texas Wesleyan University School of Law in 2000 and later worked for the Dallas County District Attorney as a general prosecutor and subsequently represented Child Protective Services. Texas State Representative Eric Johnson (D – Dallas, Mesquite) should be recalled immediately as well. Such behavior is unbecoming of a state leader. These people are stone cold racists and they are pushing bigotry and hate. These are the sentiments and comments that tear communities apart. They are extremely destructive. All elected officeholders should be held accountable for their racially-derogatory language.  
Roy Istvan, Cornell Football’s offensive line coach, was forced to issue a public apology in response to student outrage over a picture he tweeted showing two players wearing large sombreros. Istvan said he regrets his “cultural insensitivity,” but explained that the team awards sombreros to “team members who represent the best teamwork and winning spirit on and off the field.” A Cornell University football coach has been forced to issue an apology for the “cultural insensitivity” of tweeting a photo of two players wearing sombreros. Cornell Football’s offensive line coach Roy Istvan came under fire for a tweet sent out Tuesday morning, now deleted, captioned “Eman & Fosta! THE BIG SOMBRERO!” with a picture of two football players each wearing a big sombrero.  The University retweeted Istvan’s tweet, and Istvan later apologized for the photos over Twitter when the attention sparked outrage among students. “I am truly sorry for the cultural insensitivity and understand how our expression of pride came at the expensive of others in the Cornell community,” Istvan said in a Tweet.

The season premiere of the hit television dramaÂ features an amazing song performed byÂ Jussie Smollett, who plays Jamal on the show. The song, entitled âNeed Freedomâ has a very clear message: gun violence, senseless killings, and police brutality against people of color must stop, because our nation is ripping itself apart. Smollett says of the decisions that inspired him to record âNeed Freedomâ: âI recorded this exactly seven days after Philando Castile was shot. Between the shootings of Castile, Alton Sterling, at the Pulse in Orlando and the police officers in Dallas â not to mention the other numerous killings over the last couple of years â it was like we couldnât breathe. What are we doing as a people, a nation; what messages are we sending to the next generation. Then this song came.â Smollet is right, of course, and what better way to inspire people in an effort to draw peace in such a tense and violent time, where there is such anger, such division, such justified outrage, than by doing so in song? Here are just a few of the more inspiring lyrics from Smolletâs song: As I sit and think about All thatâs goinâ on My soul just cries out Can you tell me please? Tell me whoâs to blame For causing all this pain The oneâs we call to help us turn They kills us everyday See war is not the answer And love is what we need Take the chains off, break the bondage Set my people free We gotta make it better Somethingâs gotta change The world needs your voice just to make it through the rain When I think of whatâs goinâ on in this world Ohh it gets me to see my sister not breathe My sister, my brother here with me Need freedom Our world is cryinâ, no more silence, with guns and violence Need freedom I canât keep dyinâ, weâre way too quiet, no more silence Need freedom Stop this evil, free my people, weâre all equal Need freedom Our world getâs brighter, keep on tryinâ, keep on fightinâ for freedom These lyrics come on this night, September 21, as, at this very moment, protests are erupting in Charlotte, North Carolina, because yet another black man, Keith Lamont Scott, is dead at the hands of the police. Already, as per usual, the police are in front of cameras, in damage control mode, spinning the story they want the public to hear. Whether it is true matters not to them; they only want to cover their own asses, because black lives simply donât matter to them. This message is one that is definitely needed. It is, of course, a message that will likely fall on deaf ears. We live in a nation where people think that the right of every person to have as many guns as they like, anytime they like, no matter what, should supercede the rights of innocent people to live. These are the same people who think that cops can do no wrong, and that the bloodshed at their hands is always justified. These are same people who believe that freedom only applies to certain people, and to hell with everyone else. Theyâre the people who think that every black man shot by police was just another âthugâ anyway, and that the void left in the lives of his loved ones is of no importance. Theyâre the same people who donât care about what happened in Orlando, or Oregon, or Newtown, or any of the other countless places where people who should have never had firearms carried out massacres. They only care about their guns and their rigid belief that whatever happened was worth their version of âfreedom.â Hopefully, the people who need to hear this message the most will, and the killing will stop. However, I sadly wonât be able to hold my breath on that one. It will only continue another day, in another city after another innocent life is lost, or another unbelievably tragic and preventable massacre is carried out. Sadly, that is the America we live in today. Watch the video below:  
Sheriff Parnell McNamara For the vast majority of normal individuals, it wasn’t all that long ago, when we heard a phrase such as “all lives matter” we thought of it as a positive loving encompassing an inclusive statement, in that everyone’s life had purpose and should be celebrated regardless of race, age, sexual orientation or gender. Now fast forward to today and that innocent phrase that might have been spoken just a few short years ago has taken a life all its own, among the politically correct and entitlement class. Leave it to progressives and race hustlers to cleverly create a subtext of words and phrases, specifically designed to change the underlying or implicit meaning of those words and phrases original intent. And that’s perhaps where McLennan County’s top law enforcement officer, Sheriff Parnell McNamara, finds himself. It seems that the hapless sheriff isn’t up to speed with the continued changes taking place within the race baiting world of political correctness, and he’s now paying the price. His “carnal sin” was to purchase a full-page ad, in the Hometown News that says “All Lives Matter,” which of course has set off a firestorm of protests from the usual cast of characters McNamara acknowledged he bought the ad because of what he believes, saying: “I remember talking to someone about ‘All Lives Matter,’ because it aggravated me when someone said ‘All Lives Matter’ is a racial slur. All lives matter. Your life matters, mine, police, John Q citizen. It doesn’t matter what color you are. Every human being has a right to live.” And no doubt most traditional Americans feel exactly the same way; however Sheriff McNamara works within a political environment where the political establishment sets the rules governed by what is currently politically correct, and publicly stating that “all lives matter” is now considered a racist statement within the bastions of progressive orthodoxy. And making that point was Jo Welter, Community Race Relations Coalition board chairman, saying; “You can say, ‘All lives matter,’ but the fact is throughout our history, and even currently, we do not value black lives as much as we do other lives.” Then Welter went on to carefully cherry pick data that bolstered his ridicules claim. “Black Lives Matter” is divisive and counterproductive, State Rep. Charles “Doc” Anderson said. “It doesn’t help the issues. It’s inflammatory, and I think it’s intended to be so,” he said. “Most members of the black community realize that all lives matter.” McNamara added, “I know of no police officer that puts his badge and gun on in the morning and goes to work wanting to hurt someone or kill someone,” he said. “We have black police officers that have been killed. It’s a movement against police out there that’s absolutely wrong.” Sheriff’s office Sgt. Lionel McGee, put it all together. He is a black police officer who does not support BLM. He said some in the BLM movement will never support police. He said, “I tell people all the time, the incident that sparked all this with Michael Brown in Ferguson, I probably would have done the same thing. You know, that’s what started it. The deal with (Eric) Garner in New York. He was 300-something pounds. I had this argument with my own sister. How come Mr. Garner couldn’t have said, ‘Hey, y’all caught me selling illegal cigarettes on the street. You got me and put my hands behind my back, and let’s go to jail.’ He’d still be alive today. “If somebody’s fighting and struggling with you and you’re trying to arrest them and you’re doing everything in your power to arrest them, and that person don’t want to go and they happen to die or get injured or get seriously hurt, I can’t see that as being my fault.” Do you agree with this Sheriff's ad that states "All Lives Matter" or is this an insult to the black community? Let us know what you think in the comments below. Source: Waco Tribune 
Hillary Clinton’s optics don’t get much worse than this… unless of course she has seizures, her knees buckle and she’s lifted/dragged into a van – all in front of the media and on 9/11. At Temple University, which has 38,000 students, Clinton had a rally… one that probably held less than 200 attendees. If you go to her site, it says the event reached capacity. What a spin. It also looked to me like there were about as many in the press there as there were students. Just pathetic. As you can see below, a Trump rally draws thousands and is packed. And it’s not just the attendance. Clinton had to climb all of four stairs to get to the podium and exit the stage. In the pic below, you see a man having to help her as if she is elderly and bordering on being an invalid. Not exactly the picture of health or a strong leader to say the least. Wonder if Vegas is taking bets on her life expectancy.  From Top Right News: Hillary Clinton traveled to Temple University on Monday to woo millennial voters. Nearly 38,000 students are enrolled at Temple. Yet Hillary had a hard time filling up the small room… Hillary also has a hard time getting up the stairs to the platform. She then needed help just to make it up a small flight of 4 steps leaving the area. Democrats were horrified as photos of grandma Clinton were released by Getty: PHILADELPHIA, PA – SEPTEMBER 19: Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is helped up stairs after delivering a millennial speech at Temple University on September 19, 2016 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Hillary Clinton is campaigning in Pennslyvania. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Between the shoe closet rallies, lack of interest and obvious health issues… the Hildabeast is in real trouble here. Her ground game right now sucks… in Delaware, Ohio with a population of over 2 million, no one showed for a door knocking event. Add to that disclosures on Reddit that her go-to IT guy and Clinton were looking for ways to cover her tracks on emails and you have a political nuclear bomb. But there’s more! WikiLeaks is about to dump info. on Clinton smuggling weapons in Benghazi to al Qaeda. Something Glenn Beck predicted from the beginning. That scandal is getting ready to re-explode. With all of this, one of several things could happen… she could lose in a landslide to Trump, which is looking more and more likely… Clinton could drop dead before the election or she could get impeached right after being elected. Not good. The Democrats made a massive mistake in not going with someone else. They are scared stiff and should be.    
In every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. The National Democratic Party, a “powerful hate group,” has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available. [Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: America’s Most Powerful HATE Group] As a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is this author’s contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get “Hillary the Horrible” into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election. A proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone – especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President – to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud. The proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters – but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens – to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America. Due to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible. Donald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party, America’s most powerful “Hate Group,” not only wants “Hillary the Horrible” to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed. Let us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.

Hillary Clinton recently appeared on Jimmy Fallon’s The Tonight Show. Jimmy Fallon was all jokes about Hillary’s health as he reached under his desk and grabbed a surgical mask and put it on. I’m guessing that was his way of pushing the idea that Hillary’s health issues are nothing more than the flu or bad cold.   Hillary of course laughed her cackling laugh with the audience and then Fallon high-fived her. After touching her hand, Fallon reached under the desk for some hand sanitizer. I admit it was a funny gag. Fallon is a clever guy and will do all he can to help his candidate of choice. Voters DO have a right to be concerned and many medical professionals are: Hillary’s Health Concerns Serious, Say Most Doctors Polled by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) Concerns about Hillary Clinton’s health are “serious—could be disqualifying for the position of President of the U.S.,” say nearly 71% of 250 physicians responding to an informal internet survey by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS). About 20% said concerns were “likely overblown, but should be addressed as by full release of medical records.” Only 2.7% responded that they were “just a political attack; I have confidence in the letter from her physician and see no cause for concern.” While more than 81% were aware of her history of a concussion, only 59% were aware of the cerebral sinus thrombosis, and 52% of the history of deep venous thrombosis. More than 78% said the health concerns had received “not enough emphasis” in the media, and only 2.7% that there had been “too much emphasis.” So THIS is how you treat the Presidency of the United States. Make fun of voters concerns over the health of candidates who may become President of the United States. I’m so disgusted with the Left and the irony of it all is that Liberals are upset with Fallon’s satire on Hillary’s health. Boy they are a bunch of dumb nuts. WATCH Here:

As if this week was not tragic enough, we get hit with this news. It seems as if every member of NASCAR is beloved in some form or fashion. There are just some really fine people involved within this sport, and there has been for years and years. A cool thing about NASCAR is that it’s not just the drivers that are well known and loved. It’s their crew chiefs or family members. It’s executives, hardcore fans and amazing reporters. Everyone has an amazing role to play in the sport of NASCAR. Sadly, two of those beloved members have passed away. Bob Margolis and Herbert Ames. Two of some of the finest men in all of NASCAR.  Herbert was more of a beloved friend of NASCAR. He was involved in many things that gave on the behalf of the sport, and he was long time friends with almost everybody in NASCAR. Tom Jensen, reporter for Fox Sports, expressed Herbert’s personality in a great way: “If you walked up to him and asked what he did in the sport, he’d bellow loudly and say, ‘Whatever the hell I want to do!'” Margolis was known for being a first-rate writer and reporter for NASCAR. He was different than everybody else because he gave younger writers a chance to really show what they got in the complicated world of NASCAR. He always told it exactly how it was and was loved for that. It’s clear that Bob captured the hearts of many more than he probably ever knew. Both of these are already extremely missed by many in the NASCAR community, as they are mourning their losses. I played a little golf with Jim Hunter and Herbert Ames… I can only imagine the heckling taking place between those two right now. #RIP — Jimmie Johnson (@JimmieJohnson) September 22, 2016  My thoughts are also with the family and friends of @BobMargolis. — Jimmie Johnson (@JimmieJohnson) September 22, 2016  To hear we lost @BobMargolis this morning is hard to fathom…I'll cherish the time & conversations we shared over the past couple of years. — Daniel Hemric (@DanielHemric) September 22, 2016  I listened intently to what Bob Margolis had to say. He understood the complexities of the sport & hit them head-on. Prayers to his family. — Jim Cassidy (@jfcassidy) September 22, 2016  It’s always horrible to lose great people, but we know they’re in a much better place than here! Our thoughts and prayers are with both of these men’s friends and families as they navigate what to do in the coming days. 
U.S. women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe could face disciplinary action if she continues to kneel during the national anthem before games. Despite an official statement from U.S. Soccer stating that both coaches and players are expected to stand at attention during the national anthem, Rapinoe continued to kneel at the Sept. 18 game against the Netherlands, protesting what she believes to be injustice and oppression in the United States.   Rapinoe first began her protest in solidarity with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who announced that he will not stand for the anthem as long as there is continued police brutality and racial prejudice in this country. His statements and actions have created a national movement, with athletes like Rapinoe following in his footsteps.  Her actions in particular have angered U.S. Soccer, which released a statement saying that her protest goes against everything the organization stands for.  "As part of the privilege to represent your country, we have an expectation that our players and coaches will stand and honor our flag while the national anthem is played," the statement reads in part, according to ESPN. While she wasn't immediately punished for her protest, ESPN reports that the situation will be re-evaluated if Rapinoe continues to kneel throughout the rest of the season. During a home game against the Netherlands, Rapinoe was met with some backlash when she refused to stand for the anthem, with one fan yelling, "Stand up!" Nonetheless, Rapinoe has no plans of quitting her protest and is willing to risk suspension in order to make a statement. "As of now I plan to keep kneeling," she told ESPN. "I'm trying to kind of formulate a better plan and an action step moving forward. But until then, this is how I can help, this is how I can use my voice going forward, and this is how I can be an ally in this space."  Sources: ESPN (2) / Photo credit: Brad Smith via Megan Rapinoe/Instagram
(Via JewsNews) Quebec mayor gives Muslim ârefugeesâ a little piece of his mind by spilling the truth that Canadians donât adapt to them, itâs the other way around.  â MUSLIMS MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THEY MUST ADAPT TO CANADA, ITS CUSTOMS, ITS TRADITIONS, ITS WAY OF LIFE, BECAUSE IT WAS THE COUNTRY THAT WAS CHOSEN TO EMIGRATE. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT THEY MUST INTEGRATE AND LEARN TO LIVE IN CANADA. NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE TO BE FOR THEM TO CHANGE THEIR LIFESTYLE, NOT THE CANADIANS WHO SO GENEROUSLY WELCOMED THEM. YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT CANADIANS ARE NOT RACIST OR XENOPHOBIC. WE ACCEPT MANY IMMIGRANTS, IN MANY COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT CULTURES AND RELIGIONS, CONTRADICTING TO MANY MUSLIM COUNTRIES WHICH DO NOT ACCEPT IMMIGRANTS NON-MUSLIMS. FOR THIS REASON, THE CANADIANS ARE NOT WILLING TO GIVE UP THEIR IDENTITY AND THEIR CULTURE. FINALLY, THEY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN CANADA, WITH ITS JUDEO-CHRISTIAN ROOTS, CHRISTMAS TREES, CHURCHES AND RELIGIOUS FESTIVALS, RELIGION MUST REMAIN IN THE PRIVATE SPHERE. THE MUNICIPALITY OF DURVAL HAS THE RIGHT TO REFUSE ANY CONCESSIONS TO ISLAM AND SHARIA LAW. FOR MUSLIMS, WHO ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH THE CANADIAN CULTURE AND RELIGION AND DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE IN CANADA, THERE ARE 57 BEAUTIFUL MUSLIM COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD, MOST OF THEM UNDER-POPULATED AND READY TO RECEIVE THEM WITH OPEN ARMS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SHARIA LAW. IF YOU LEFT HIS COUNTRY TO COME TO CANADA, AND NOT TO A MUSLIM COUNTRY, IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE CONSIDERED THAT LIFE IS BETTER IN CANADA THAN IN OTHER PLACES. HELP YOURSELF TO THE QUESTION, JUST ONCE: WHY IS IT BETTER HERE IN CANADA THAT WHERE IT COMES FROM. It boggles my mind that many feel that they have the right or the authority to control other peoples lives. This is the direct opposite of what we feel as humans. Because Muslims cannot eat a particular meal, should mean they should bring their own. The few should never out weigh the many, especially when it comes to adopted culture. Adopt it, or don’t. Just do block others from it. Gernot Trolf Mar 28, 2016 at 1:12 pm The Prime Minister of Australia said much the same and I agree with you both wholeheartedly. Spread the word. Adapt or leave
Fox News host Sean Hannity desperately tried to smear Terence Crutcher on Wednesday as a violent criminal who was wanted by police but was repeatedly shut down by a local Tulsa news anchor. Crutcher was shot and killed by white police police officer Betty Shelby even though he had his hands up and was surrounded by other police officers. The murder was caught on camera. Clearly, the unarmed Crutcher was not a threat to the safety of the officers, especially when you consider the fact that police officers have consistently taken in armed white suspects alive without ever firing a shot at them. But Sean Hannity repeatedly claimed during his radio show that Crutcher had a violent criminal record and had warrants out for his arrest. “I understand that in this particular case Mr Crutcher has a long criminal history and appeared to be under the influence or so the police are charging,” Hannity said, which prompted Tulsa news anchor Russell Mills to smack Hannity down with facts. “Well I’ll tell you I looked up his history and I’m not seeing a lot of criminal history,” Mills replied. “We have something called the OSCN – the Oklahoma Supreme Court Network. I was able to find a protective order from 12 years ago that was dismissed. I found a couple of financial things. There’s no violent criminal history for Mr. Crutcher that I’ve been able to uncover.” But Hannity didn’t want to hear the truth so he moved on to claiming that Crutcher had several warrants out for his arrest. Mills informed Hannity that there were no such warrants. Hannity responded that he read somewhere that there were warrants. “I have not seen any reporting on any warrants for Mr. Crutcher and I certainly haven’t uncovered any myself,” Mills said. “There has been some misinformation floated.” A disappointed Hannity resorted to claiming that he has a “source” within the department and said that “it’s a matter of time of when they’re gonna release this information.” Here’s the audio via Media Matters:  Once again, Sean Hannity tries to demonize another black victim of a police shooting in order to make people believe the shooting was totally justified. The bottom line, however, is that Crutcher had his hands up and was surrounded by officers. He wasn’t a threat to them or anyone else but they executed him anyway. Officer Betty Shelby should be arrested and charged with murder. Period. 
“Rather than end dangerous politically-driven policies that have put a total of 85,000 deportable criminal aliens back onto the streets in the last three years, ICE tried to hide them by providing grossly inaccurate information to Congress and the American people.” —Dan Stein, President of FAIR In a report released by the Federation of American Immigration Reform (FAIR), they have charged that the Obama administration “grossly misrepresented – by almost tenfold” the number of crimes that were committed by illegal, criminal aliens who were released from custody in fiscal year 2014. Now, if the term “illegal, criminal aliens” sounds like overkill, understand that the term illegal does refer to aliens who are in the united States illegally, which makes them criminals. However, applying the term criminal relates to the fact that they committed a crime while here illegals and were incarcerated, but not deported. “In response to an inquiry from the House Judiciary Committee in July 2015, ICE reported that the 30,558 criminal aliens it released, instead of deported, in FY 2014 were convicted of an additional 1,423 offenses,” read FAIR’s press release. “However, the ICE records that were requested by The Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI) on FAIR’s behalf show that the actual number of subsequent convictions racked up by the criminal aliens ICE released in FY 2014 was actually 13,288. It is important to note that not all criminal charges result in convictions. Thus, the number of offenses committed by criminal aliens ICE turned loose is likely significantly greater.” “The criminal aliens responsible for these 13,288 convictions were not considered sufficiently dangerous to be deported under ICE’s self-declared ‘priorities’ for removal,” the press release added. “The list of convictions for offenses committed by criminals ICE did not deem worthy of deportation in FY 2014 includes: homicide, kidnapping, assault, sexual assault, drunk driving, and other offenses. Yet despite the clear knowledge that its policies resulted in thousands of avoidable crimes, ICE doubled down in FY 2015—releasing nearly 20,000 additional deportable criminals.” “In recent years, the number of criminal aliens deported has plummeted, despite ample funds to remove many more. As a result of Obama administration policies that place protection of illegal aliens—including criminals—over the safety of the American public, thousands of people have been needlessly victimized,” charged Dan Stein, president of FAIR. “Rather than end dangerous politically-driven policies that have put a total of 85,000 deportable criminal aliens back onto the streets in the last three years, ICE tried to hide them by providing grossly inaccurate information to Congress and the American people,” added Stein. “Moreover, despite knowing the true extent of the criminal activities committed by the aliens they were releasing, DHS scrapped the Secure Communities program designed to allow ICE to take custody of criminal aliens who are being held by local police.” “Congress has to act. It is being lied to by an administration that is misrepresenting the facts and a president that refuses to enforce immigration laws in favor of manipulating policy for political gain,” Stein concluded. In March of 2015 Freedom of Information Act Documents exposed the fact that 165,900 convicted criminal illegals were released on the streets of the US by Homeland Security. They were not deported. In fact, so-called “sanctuary cities” released 9,000 criminal illegals in 9 months during 2015 who were supposed to be deported, but never were. In 2014, it was also reported the administration released 75% of illegals rather than deport them. It appears to me that DHS needs to be renamed the Department of Homeland IN-Security.

The great State of Texas has come down hard with the Obama administration refugee program. Texas has taken more than their share so far. Now they want some security guarantees for the administration. They will reuse refugees if demands not met. Or so it seems. Read more here.  As Written By Kevin Diaz for the Houston Chronicles: Texas, which has taken in more refugees than any state in the nation over the past year, is threatening to leave the federal refugee program if the Obama administration does not meet its security demands. The dispute comes as the Obama administration has announced a new goal of resettling 110,000 refugees in the United States in the coming year, including an unspecified increase in the number from Syria. In a letter Wednesday to Robert Carey, director of the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission said that unless Washington “unconditionally” approves the state’s new plan controlling placements in Texas by September 30, the agency will “exit” the program. Without an agreement, Texas would join Kansas and New Jersey in withdrawing state participation in the refugee program over the federal government’s vetting procedures to screen out potential terrorists…..

As this bizarre election cycle heads into the home stretch, the issue of race relations in America has become almost all-consuming. Add the shootings of two black men in Tulsa and Charlotte by police and the fuse to the powder keg is remarkably short. As the left contends that systemic institutional racism is alive and well in this country, the right fires back with Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr. quotes to prove that it’s not. While liberals decry the shooting of unarmed black men as evidence of the violence and oppression inherent in the system, conservatives write it off not as black men being killed but rather as “thugs” getting what they deserve for “non-compliance.” One of the favorite pastimes of the modern conservative is to forget the due process afforded to all Americans under the constitution and instead convict them with their past records. Forgetting that institutional racism extends into police departments and court systems, making young black men more susceptible to arrest and conviction, we know about every instance of driving without a license, resisting arrest and jaywalking ever perpetrated by every black man ever shot and killed by police. Today, while looking through a Twitter feed at a Fox News report about Tulsa Officer Betty Shelby being charged with manslaughter for killing a man with his hands in the air, I came across a tweet that shows that racism is without a doubt alive and well in America: @foxandfriends@blp3pic.twitter.com/JmjD5DNCRA — Theresa (@VOTE_TRUMP_) September 23, 2016  Once again, conservatives feel the need to point out that the police officer who killed a man shouldn’t be held accountable because he was a very, very bad person. There’s only one problem here: the tweeted information is about the man killed in Charlotte, not Terence Crutcher, who was killed by the officer in question. My response was as simple as I could possibly make it: @VOTE_TRUMP_ @foxandfriends @blp3 Why is another man’s record relevant? Oh…because “they” are all the same, right? — ezekiel wilekenmeyer (@wilekenmeyer) September 23, 2016  Terence Crutcher being judged on the criminal record of Kieth Lamont Scott isn’t really that surprising, is it? What’s far less surprising is that nobody bothered to mention the mistake. That’s because my response was accurate. To the conservative racist, It makes no difference which black man was convicted of which crimes or that they were two different individuals separated by a dozen states who had never met. “They” are all the same. How fitting is it that her handle is “@VOTE_TRUMP_” Because…of course it is.
Bernard Sansaricq, former president of the Haitian Senate, issued a blistering statement condemning the Clinton Foundation, which has been posted at Donald Trump’s campaign website. Sansaricq’s statement says: Sadly, when an earthquake rocked the nation of Haiti in 2010, corruption moved in faster than the help so desperately needed. Today, the people of Haiti are still suffering despite the billions of dollars that have flowed into the Clinton Foundation. The Clintons exploited this terrible disaster to steal billions of dollars from the sick and starving people of Haiti. The world trusted the Clintons to help the Haitian people during their most desperate time of need and they were deceived. The Clintons and their friends are richer today while millions still live in tents. The world deserves to know where the money went and why help was never sent. The situation Sansaricq refers to is discussed in detail here, and also features prominently in Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich. Speaking at a Trump rally last Friday, Sansaricq accused President Bill Clinton of trying to bribe him. He said his visa was revoked after he refused the offer. A group of Haitian protesters demonstrated against the Clinton Foundation’s actions in Haiti during the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia 
Hillary Clinton has just postponed a high-dollar fundraiser, indefinitely! The event, called “lunch with Hillary Rodham Clinton” invited donor levels between $2700 and $100,000 to attend. No reason was given for the change of event, originally scheduled to take place at the home of Michael Warner and Betty Craven. Clearly, Hillary Clinton’s serious health issues are why her campaign is imploding! This indefinite postponement couldn’t come at a worse possible time, as the campaign reportedly spent $50 million just last month trying to defeat Donald Trump. As WNCN reports: A small Eastern North Carolina town is preparing for Donald Trump’s appearance Tuesday just as a Hillary Clinton event in Chapel Hill on Tuesday was postponed. Trump will hold a rally in Kenansville Tuesday just two weeks after making a stop in Greenville. The rally will be held at the Duplin County Event Center and it is likely to be the largest event ever held in Kenansville, with a population of about 855. Duplin County Schools announced on Monday they would be closing at noon Tuesday in anticipation of Trump’s visit. High amounts of traffic are expected in the area, school officials said. Meanwhile, Clinton campaign officials said Monday afternoon that a Tuesday fundraiser in Chapel Hill was postponed. The Clinton event was billed as “lunch with Hillary Rodham Clinton” and had four donation levels to attend. Those contribution levels were described as $100,000, which featured “chair reception with Hillary,” $33,000, which included a “host reception with Hillary,” $5,000, which included “preferred seating” and $2,700. While Hillary was unable to make an appearance, Trump is planning rallies in Kenansville, just weeks after a stop in Greenville. While Kenansville has a population of 855, the Trump rally at the Duplin County Event Center will likely be the largest event they have ever held. 10,000 supporters are expected. Donald Trump made sure to point out Hillary cancelling a fundraiser: Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. Sleep well Hillary – see you at the debate! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 20, 2016  Reporters are standing by to see if Hillary Clinton’s plans this week in Florida will also be cancelled without explanation. What do you think Hillary Clinton is hiding? Please leave us a comment (below) and tell us.  
Hillary Clinton proposed on Thursday a new series of progressive taxes that would raise rates on the nation’s ultra-rich. The most significant of her new proposals calls for raising the top estate tax rate to 65% from the current 40%, a move that would generate about $260 billion in new government revenue over the next decade. Clinton had already proposed raising the rate on some millionaires to 45%, but her new plan, drawing heavily on that of her social democratic primary challenger Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT), would be even more progressive. Three new estate tax brackets would be added under the new system: a 50% rate for couples with estates valued over $10 million, a 55% rate for couples with estates valued over $50 million, and a 65% rate for couples with estates valued over $1 billion. Although the Trump campaign predictably railed against an “even higher hike in the death tax,” only an infinitesimal number of incredibly wealthy Americans would be affected by the new rates. According to IRS data only 223 estates with taxable value over $50 million filed estate tax claims in 2014, and there are fewer than 1,000 people in the entire country who would ever be subjected to the highest rate. This very minimal burden on a tiny number of families that are more than able to shoulder it would pay for Clinton’s proposed simplification of small business taxes and expansion of the child tax credit, programs that will millions of Americans. While cynical Republican demagogues have painted the estate tax as an oppressive punishment for small businesses, couples with less than $5.5 million in assets – or 99.8% of the nation – pay no estate tax at all. The rhetorical acrobatics and outright lies required to convince the average American that they are at risk from the so-called “death tax” is astounding. In reality, Clinton’s proposed hikes would actually lessen the tax burden on small businesses by financing a simplification of the business tax code. All in all, Clinton’s tax proposals would generate about $1.5 trillion in new revenue over the next decade, with the vast majority of the burden falling on the super-rich. Donald Trump, in contrast, has called for eliminating the estate tax entirely and slashing taxes by $12 trillion over the next decade, a move that most reasonable economists agree would cause a severe recession and eliminate a staggering 3.5 million jobs. The Clinton campaign reportedly collaborated with Sen. Sanders’ former economic advisers to produce the new estate tax plan, and indeed it is almost identical to Sanders’ primary proposal. Today’s announcement was thus one of the most concrete examples of Clinton’s shifting leftward in an attempt to win over skeptical progressives who supported Sanders in the primary. Sanders himself praised the proposal and released a statement endorsing it, saying that “Secretary Clinton understands that it is appropriate to ask the top three-tenths of 1%, the very wealthiest people in this country, to pay their fair share of taxes so that we can provide a child tax credit for millions of working families and lower taxes for small businesses.”
The city of Flint, Michigan is suffering through a horrible man-made disaster that could have been easily prevented if state Republicans hadnât been so careless. After placing Flint under state control, officials chose to save money by switching the cityâs drinking water from Lake Huron to the Flint River, which has not been the drinking water source for decades because it was poisoned and considered unsafe for human consumption. As a result, the city has been devastated by lead poisoning, which will have terrible consequences for years to come for the children who ingested the tainted water. Understandably, Flint is mad as hell so they decided to take the state to court. But because Michigan Republicans and Governor Rick Snyder are rats who hate democracy and justice, they shut down any potential lawsuit by stripping Flint of the power to sue. According to the : Though Flint has not been under a state-appointed emergency manager since April 2015, the state still exerts partial control over the city through a five-member Receivership Transition Advisory Board, whose members are appointed by Gov. Rick Snyder. The board moved quickly to change the rules under which Flint is governed so that the city cannot file a lawsuit without first getting approval from that state-appointed board. This is absolutely outrageous. Itâs like a woman having to get permission to file a lawsuit from the company whose CEO raped her. Michigan Republicans should not have the power to take away anyoneâs right to seek redress through the court system. It sounds like they are just scared that they will lose the case. And frankly, they should be. After all, it was their decisions that led to Flint being poisoned with tainted water and the cover-up that followed. The city of Flint absolutely should be able to sue the state in open court. But Republicans took that power away from Flint, and you can be damn sure that they would love to do that in every city across all fifty states if they have their way. 
Senator Mark Kirk (R-IL) has been caught red-handed lying about the details of his military service, and it isnât the first time he has done it. From The : CNN reported Wednesday that Kirkâs campaign website erroneously stated that he is âa veteran of the Iraq War.â In reality, the senator stayed in the United States during the war as he served in the Navy Reserve. His campaign chalked it up to a staff error, saying that particular page on Kirkâs website was not meant to be public and that staff members were making edits to it. Staff moved the page behind a password-protected firewall after CNN investigated. Kirk, who is up for re-election this year, has previously been caught in the middle of lies about his military career. He claimed in 2010 that he had been named âIntelligence Officer of the Year,â when the award was for work his entire unit had done. He also promoted a story alleging that his reconnaissance plane had come under fire, but there was no record of that. Kirk claimed that he had served in âcombatâ in Kosovo, but he didnât. He claimed he had been deployed to Afghanistan, but he had been sent there for training, not for combat service. He also previously falsely claimed to have been deployed to combat in Operation Desert Storm. Kirkâs lies about his service would be a major issue at any time, but they are even more notable because he is facing a strong challenge from Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL). Duckworth is an actual combat veteran who served in the Iraq War. In that conflict, Duckworth received a Purple Heart after her helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. She is a double amputee after her severe injuries forced the removal of her right leg near the hip and her left leg below the knee. In polling averages, Duckworth is currently 7% ahead of Kirk. 
It takes a lot of courage to tell the world that one of your family members has been radicalized to the point that (s)he is willing to injure and/or kill people. It takes courage because a lot of people would feel horrible “turning” on their family like that and would avoid doing it, believing that they could take care of it within their own home. So, to finally gather that strength and go to the American FBI with the information that your son is engaging in suspicious/potentially terroristic activity, and then to have the very people who are slated with the safety of the American people tell you that your child is not a danger as per their guidelines, has to be a HUGE relief. Until you flip on the news one day and figure out that they were DEAD wrong.  Terrorist suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami’s father, Mohammad Rahami, went to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in August of 2014 with serious concerns about his son. He says that they investigated Ahmad for two months before coming to the conclusion that he is “clean.” Mohammad took them at their word and accepted their findings. And then, on an innocent day in September, Rahami flipped on the news like millions of other Americans and saw the name of a bombing suspect scroll across the screen; his son’s name. “Two years ago I go to the F.B.I. because my son was doing really bad, O.K.?” he said. “But they check almost two months, they say, ‘He’s O.K., he’s clean, he’s not a terrorist.’ I say O.K.” He added: “Now they say he is a terrorist. I say O.K.” After several weeks of interagency checks, interviews and database reviews, the FBI had determined that Ahmad did not pose a terroristic threat to America. Then, after being taken into custody, authorities found a blood-stained notebook with a bullet hole in it. In this notebook were writings about “killing the kuffar” and passages that appeared to be sympathetic to the jihadist cause. This, according to a LEO who wished to remain anonymous during the interview. In this notebook, which is believed to belong to Rahami, there were writings that celebrated lone wolf attacks on American soil, as well as former al Qaeda propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki. Keep in mind this whole “my son is a terrorist” bit started with Ahmad stabbing his brother in the leg with a knife during an argument. Whatever his punishment is determined to be will be too good for him. 
No matter the issue, Leftists are for it, before they are against it. As long as the issues doesn’t impact Liberals personally, they remain content. Leftist support the military, until they decide to make the military into baby-killers. Also, Leftist embrace law enforcement, until it’s time for them decry law enforcement. Now we have another such issue as reported in the Washington Times. The same Chicago environmentalists who blocked filmmaker George Lucas from building a museum last month are now welcoming the nearby Obama presidential library, sparking accusations of political hypocrisy. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, said Friday that her group is “thrilled” to see Obama Presidential Center being built in a park on Chicago’s South Side. Just five weeks ago, the group forced Mr. Lucas to abandon his plans for a similar lakefront project about seven miles north of the proposed Obama site after a two-year legal battle. The Chicago environmentalist scumbags’ decision contradicts their own charter. The Obama center  requires bulldozing trees and grass at Jackson Park. Meanwhile, the proposed Lucas museum would have been built on a parking lot used by Chicago Bears fans for tailgating. Let’s see; wrecking the environment for the black man’s library or razing a parking lot for the white guy. Every environmentalists dilemma? Pretty much an environmental “no brainer,” unless you’re dealing with hypocrite Liberals, and crooked Chicago politics.     
A Louisiana police officer has been fired and arrested after being caught on camera repeatedly beating a burglary suspect while he was handcuffed and lying facedown. Footage of Officer Robert Wallow was found in which he punched 21-year-old Carlos Gustavo in the face after successfully arresting him. Wallow then handcuffed Pineda and then kick him three more times in the head and the side. Gustavo’s arrest occurred on April 22nd, but since Pineda or his attorney did not report any use of excessive force, the incident was not discovered by authorities until Wallow was a subject of an internal inquiry in relation to another case. “It all had been documented,” said Police Chief Arthur Lawson. “It just did not move as quickly as it should have.” Wallow was placed on administrative leave and then fired the next day. The department quickly opened a criminal investigations into Wallow’s cruel tactics. He has been charged with battery and malfeasance in office. “This is not one of the brightest days of the Gretna Police Department,” said Lawson. You can see the footage of the arrest here:       
The Vikings continue to receive bad news on the offensive side of the ball. When Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson went down in pain holding his knee, the news didn’t look good in regards to their star back.  Early reports were that he would just miss a few games at most due to a torn meniscus, but that news has taken a turn for the worst. The star running back is set for surgery on Thursday and will miss three-to-four months with the knee injury.  This puts his time table for December at the earliest and a likely playoff push for the NFC North. With Adrian Peterson having surgery tomorrow, he’s likely out until December at least. Would loom large for a potential playoff appearance. — Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) September 21, 2016  #Vikings RB Adrian Peterson has told @FitzBeatSr & @JosinaAnderson he’s having his meniscus repaired — not trimmed. Would mean out months. — Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) September 21, 2016  #Vikings RB Adrian Peterson is set to have meniscus surgery Thursday. He is holding out hope for a playoff return. https://t.co/SAaCqQlNbF — USA TODAY Sports (@USATODAYsports) September 21, 2016  Peterson has shown over and over that he is a special type of player on the football field and off, so if anyone can come back from this injury sooner than expected, it would be the Vikings soon to be Hall-of-Fame running back.  However, age isn’t on his side and no matter how much you train and get ready for the season, the older you get the more difficult it is to get out there after major injuries. This puts a major clamp on the Vikings hope for the playoffs as they are now down both of their leaders on offense.  Teddy Bridgewater was lost for the year in the preseason as he torn his ACL on a non-contact play in practice. Matt Asiata and Jerrick McKinnon are the likely candidates to take over the running back position for the remainder of the season while Peterson is out as he recovers from his knee surgery.  Both backs are average, but they don’t bring what Peterson brings to the table. You never ask for an injury, but this is football and injuries happen.  With the recent injury to Peterson, this only helps both those other teams in the NFC North and the rest of the conference on making the playoffs. Here’s to a speedy recovery for Peterson!
A Donald Trump supporter in Bellingham, Washington delivered a shocking rebuke to an obvious Hillary Clinton fan that may have jolted some sense into her – literally. When local police failed to respond to Ray Gilbride’s complaints that someone was removing “Trump” signs from his front yard, he decided to take matters into his own hands – and not merely because the culprit was interfering with his constitutional right to express his political opinion. “The fact is, stealing is stealing. I’m getting a lot of that criticism, too, people saying it’s just a sign. Why do we prosecute kids for stealing just a candy bar? Situational ethics is wrong. Stealing is stealing. You’ve got to go back to the basics. If it’s not yours don’t touch it.” And it wasn’t just theft – whoever was removing the “Trump” signs was trespassing on Gilbride’s property. So, after talking to police about his legal options to protect his property – the front yard and the signs – Gilbride rigged up a trip-wire and hooked it up to a non-lethal electric charge that would deliver a surprise to the Clinton-supporting thief the next time she made a late night raid. “It would have been different if somebody hooked it to a 110 (volt) outlet and watched somebody get hurt,” said Gilbride, adding that a pulsating charge similar to that used in invisible pet fences doesn’t do any lasting damage.  Sure enough, the surveillance camera caught the image of the unsuspecting woman running onto Gilbride’s yard in the middle of the night, making her way to the now-electrified “Trump” sign. “She just stopped, just a dead stop,” Gilbride told local news reporters. The woman, who remains unidentified, eventually regained her senses, according to the laughing homeowner, and was able to make off with the signs, anyway. Presumably she wouldn’t be quite as in favor of this form of supporting a candidate if it was Gilbride sneaking onto her yard in the middle of the night to steal “I’m With Her” signs. Funny how that works for some liberals. 
A Chat With The Devil The share of the small business market is dwindling. Almost all the sectors of the economy suffer – grocery stores, factories, small farms, etc. The negative impact is obvious in many aspects. We can pay visits to small towns and the abandoned and boarded stores as we tour their dead downtowns. Talk to farmers, who live in poverty on their 100-acre farms. They are looking for jobs. The corporate farms, which have the money to influence politicians, push for regulations that the small farmers can’t afford. The neo-lords drive them out and buy more and more of their land turning them into peasants. [Read Related Article: Who are the Neo-Lords?] Small business is the biggest creator of jobs. The middle class in America is suffering as a result of the elite-businessmen influencing legislation that destroys small business, and when they move their factories out of the country, they take what’s left of the jobs with them, leaving destruction in their wake. High taxes and other policies hurt big business, but kills small business. The increasing wealth in the hands of big business makes them more competitive. The foreign-made products that need cheap labor are welcome in the country since it is produced by our Big Business-men. They can move their factories abroad, while a small business can’t. On the other hand, pharmaceutical companies, which do not need cheap labor, operate in America. They are left to abuse the market by enjoying the ban on medicines made abroad from entering the country. The government decided that medicines made in England, Germany, France, Japan, etc. can’t be sold in the United States. Ironically, some medicines produced in America are sold to Chinese patients for a fraction of what they charge American patients. In fact, China negotiated recently further drug price cuts with our patriotic companies, lowering the prices for the Chinese in some cases, to less than 50%. Now, let’s sneak under the table and listen to a conversation between two elite businessmen… one is a tycoon and the other is his young protégé: – We will make the lake deeper; we can fish with our big boats, and they will drown with their small boats. – What do you mean? – We will make the government build extra infrastructure that benefits our big business and kills the small business. – Don’t they pay more taxes than we do? The government will use that money to help us kill them? – Yes, we’ll put them out of business using their own money. Now, their customers are ours; we swallowed the market. – Oh, it looks like some of them survived! – Not for long – we’re getting bigger, we can sell cheap. 10% profit is good for us, but for a small business owner, it wouldn’t even feed his kids. – We did it. They are out of business….Wait a minute, the relatively bigger ones are still in business! – Hmm….a free trade agreement will finish them….We will tell the government to sign a couple of these agreements. The manufacturers can’t compete with the products made by the slaves in China. – How about us? Would we be able to compete with the Chinese products? – For sure, no. But you know what? We can move our business to China. They can’t do that. They are too small to do it. – It looks like with the cheap merchandise sold by some of the small service businesses are flourishing. – Not for long. They will boom, then after some time they will die. As we keep closing the factories, we will keep firing workers. These jobless workers will have no money to spend, and the market will diminish. – Wouldn’t that hurt us as well? – Yes and we’ll be bankrupt. – How would this be good for us? – Did you forget that the politicians are ours? The government will bail us out. – With tax money paid by the people whom we fired? – Yes, and the government will feed the smaller business to the bigger one. We will buy them, and the government will pay. – Wouldn’t this mean that we have to downsize? – Precisely, and we fire more workers. – You mean the workers who paid the taxes that the government used to buy the smaller business for us that they used to work for? – Yes, we kill them with their own sword. We starve them and their children with their own money. – We have a Democrat president and a Republican Congress. Which one will help us? – Both. They are ours. One would decide and the other would approve. After they yell at the executives and box their ears. – The market is smaller now, what are we going to do? – No harm. If the middle class is diminishing in America, it is growing in China. What we lose here, we’ll gain there. – Don’t you feel bad for America and the Americans? – Ah… I feel good for my money. We used to be British, now we are Americans, and soon we’ll be Chinese. The king doesn’t care which kingdom he is ruling.

Donald Trump has just received what has to be his most positive poll of the general election season, showing the Republican nominee opening up a large lead over Hillary Clinton, while support among black voters is soaring to levels Democrats had not thought possible. The new USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times “Daybreak” poll released on Sunday shows Trump with a commanding 6.7 percent lead over Clinton, 47.7 percent to 41.0 percent, an indication that Hillary’s collapsing after being forced to leave a 9/11 memorial early is taking its toll, along with the every changing explanations for the health scare from her campaign, which ranged from “overheated” to the flu, to pneumonia. More impressive and yet worrisome for Democrats, and the reason the party, all Democrat Media Complex, and Hillary Clinton herself has been going full-force with the “birther equals racist” narrative, is Trump’s massive gains among black voters in the past week. Trump now has over 20 percent support among black voters, up from only 3 percent just a week ago. Hillary Clinton has 70 percent, significantly lower than the number typically enjoyed by Democrat nominees. Notable is that voters under the age of 35 previously were favored by sizable margins by Clinton, but now the bloviating billionaire and reality TV actor has an 8-point advantage. And among those with a high school education or less, Trump’s support has surged to a 21-point advantage, up from single digits only weeks ago. The LA Times poll has before been favorable to Trump previously, showing the race tighter than most when Clinton was leading significantly. However, this poll, with Trump’s sizable lead and improving performance among black voters, has got to cause panic among Democrats and the Clinton campaign. I thought several times last week that Democrats must be really worried about Trump going after black voters with the focus suddenly being on birtherism — an issue that hadn’t been talked about for several months that the media just recently brought back into the conversation. It’s likely that Clinton’s internal polling was also showing Trump’s surge among black voters even before the LA Times poll. Look for the race card to be ramped up even further in the coming days.

Protests have erupted in Charlotte, North Carolina after another African-American man was shot and killed by police on Tuesday afternoon. The victim was reportedly disabled and was reading a book in his car when cops approached him. According to police reports, officers came acrossÂ Keith Lamont Scott while they were at his apartment complex to serve a warrant to someone else. Police claim that Scott had a gun and âposed an imminent deadly threat to the officers,âÂ but family and witnesses dispute that claim. A woman identifying herself as the victimâs daughter, Lyric Scott, said that her father didnât have a gun, he had a book. âHe sits in the shade, reads his book, does his studies, and waits on his kid to get off the bus,â the woman said. âHe didnât have no gun. He wasnât messing with nobody. All they did, them âjumpout boys,â them undercover detectives, they jumped out their truck, they said, âHands up he got a gun, he got a gun, pow pow pow pow.â Thatâs it.â You can see her video below: Hereâs the manâs sister. She says he did not have a gun. @CMPD says he did. @WBTV_News pic.twitter.com/JwHMixy9m7 â Sarah-Blake Morgan (@SarahBlakeWBTV) September 20, 2016 Protesters poured onto the streets of Charlotte on Tuesday night, chanting âBlack lives matterâ and âHands up donât shoot.â Police turned out in riot gear and have deployed tear gas to control the crowds. Meanwhile, the number of protesters continues to grow. You can watch video of the protests below:  
Police protected and served the hell out of a teen girl in Hagerstown, Md. in a chilling incident that took place on Sunday. The 15-year-old biracial girl was riding her bike when she was hit by a car. She laid unconscious on the pavement for about 30 seconds and when she came to, she checked herself for injuries and decided to ride her bike home. Witnesses urged her to wait for the ambulance and police to show up, but the girl said she was fine and wanted to leave the scene. That’s when the police showed up and the situation went from bad to worse. In a Facebook video posted online, an onlooker caught the police manhandling the girl, slamming her into a wall, handcuffing her, shoving her into the back of a police car then pepper-spraying her in the face. For being hit by a car and trying to leave the girl was slapped with disorderly conduct, two counts of second-degree assault, possession of marijuana and failure to obey a traffic device. An attorney for the girl named Robin Ficker recounted the incident: She was dazed, then she got up and realized she was OK.” Ficker says when paramedics arrived the girl refused medical assistance and when she tried to ride away on her bike, police pulled the 5 foot 105 lbs girl off her bike. At this point, Ficker says the police lifted both her arms above her head and slammed her face first into a wall, adding: Her face hit the windowsill.” Ficker said at this point his client became terrified and struggled with police as they shoved her into the back of a police car. She refused to pull her feet into the car. That’s when the video begins. The cop warns her to pull her feet in or she’ll get pepper sprayed. In the video, the girl begs the white officers to call “Zack” who was a black officer she was apparently familiar with. A bystander then intervenes and questions the police over why they are treating the girl so roughly, the officer responds: “What happens…when she’s like, ‘I’m fine,’ right, and has a brain injury or something like that, and then she could die later? And she’s going to come over here and fight us when all we want to do is make sure she’s OK.” At this point, the police close the door on the girl’s feet and through a cracked window gas the backseat with pepper spray while the girl screams that she can’t breathe. Despite the police’s insistence, the girl had to be evaluated by a hospital for her injuries, rather than take her to the ER or turn her over to the paramedics, they take her straight to the police station and booked her on multiple charges. It took three hours for the girl to be released from jail, where her father drove her straight to the hospital to get the burning chemicals flushed from her eyes. Ficker says: The only treatment she got (from police) was slamming, abuse and Mace.” The girl is an honor student and never had a run-in with the law until Sunday. The Hagerstown police say they are reviewing body cam footage of the incident, but found the girl to be at fault for the bicycle accident. Featured Image via Facebook (Screen Capture)
The wife of Keith Scott got the audio and some video of the police shooting her husband. You don’t actually see them shoot him, you just see the aftermath and her screaming at them. She kept saying he didn’t have a gun and that he was on meds for some mental impairment he had. Gee, did that cause him to wear a thigh holster and carry a gun? Regardless of her claiming he didn’t have one, you can plainly hear the officers telling him to put the gun down repeatedly. He got out of the car first with the gun and then got back in. The police were going to break the windows and he got out again with the gun drawn. That is when they shot him. You can clearly hear her at the end yelling at Keith not to do something. He evidently did it and it involved the gun, which got him a dirt nap. I’m sorry, I have no sympathy for any of this. He deliberately would not obey repeated commands by the police and that got him shot.  From Western Journalism: The wife of shooting victim Keith Scott was pleading with him not to do something in the final moments before his fatal encounter with police officers on Tuesday, according to a cellphone video recorded by Scott’s wife and shared by the family with The New York Times. Scott was killed Tuesday by Charlotte-Mecklenburg, N.C., police after a confrontation in which police said Scott became aggressive and was a threat to the officers. Police reportedly have recovered a gun from the scene that had on it Scott’s fingerprints and DNA. The cellphone video was given to The Times by Scott family lawyer Justin Bamberg. Videos taken by police cameras have been termed by the police as inconclusive in documenting what took place just before police fatally shot Scott. I don’t understand his wife either. There’s nothing that could have kept me from my husband at that point. And I sure as hell would not be stopping to video all of it. He’s far more precious to me than whatever lawsuit this woman is angling for. The media of course is lapping this up and painting his wife and him as victims. Typical. Scott’s family, initially contended that he was carrying a book, but after viewing the police video on Thursday said it was “impossible to discern” what, if anything, he was carrying. They urged police to release the footage. “There’s nothing in that video that shows him acting aggressively, threatening or maybe dangerous,” said Justin Bamberg, one of the lawyers representing the family, said in an interview early on Friday. Well, you can’t see anything in the damned video, so I guess that is right. But you can hear the police telling him to drop the gun again and again. Despite law enforcement’s refusal to release any footage, Scott’s family gave a video recorded by his wife to NBC News. It aired on MSNBC less than an hour after authorities’ press conference ended. That was totally staged. I’ve lost all patience with this victim mentality that seems rampant out there… and I am beyond done with Black Lives Matter. The police can’t win for losing here.    
Most Americans don’t realize that all revolutions aren’t the result of overt force. Hitler, for instance, was voted into power in Germany, as was Hugo Chávez in Venezuela. Currently in the United States we are in the process of such a revolution by the progressive controlled Democrat party – sadly too many Americans are oblivious to what is happening. It is impossible to know for sure whether this revolution is being orchestrated by a SPECTRE-like secret cabal, or is the result of years of progressive fellow travelers advancing similar goals. In either case what has resulted is in essence a coup. America’s progressive revolution is being fought with ballots rather than bullets, and the progressives are winning. In order to do this the progressive movement had to overcome traditional American values or they would never be successful electing their way to power. Seriously, if the Democrat Party had run with its present polices 60 years ago they would have not have come close to winning a single state. So how have they managed to get to where they are today? In the ‘60’s progressives, then called liberals started taking over the liberal arts departments of our colleges and universities. Those humanity majors they converted to their ideology went into journalism, education, and the entertainment media. Whether it was by plan or by inclination most of these liberal college grads joined the Democrat party. Since Kennedy every single Democrat nominee for president has championed the progressive ideology. You could argue that Lyndon Johnson and Bill Clinton who were more opportunists than true believers, but that didn’t stop them from supporting progressive goals. Today you’d have a tough time finding even a moderate Democrat candidate. Heck, nearly half of the party was fine with nominating a self-described socialist. Along with a news and entertainment media protecting Democrats, and the education system promoting the progressive ideology you have former and current Democrats in government sponsoring policies that garner still more votes and thereby gain more power. Does anyone honestly believe that a picture ID is that difficult to come by? Democrats are all for anything legal, quasi-legal, and some would say even illegal to recruit more voters. Immigrants and refugees are welcomed, given entitlements and are set to be Democratic voters as soon as possible. We all remember the ACORN voter fraud scandal, but if anyone seriously thinks that that was an isolated incident should really think again. The progressive revolution is ongoing. There are around 300 so-called sanctuary cities in the United States. These progressive cities refuse to obey the law of the land and have gotten away with it. Likewise whole states refuse to follow federal laws when they don’t agree with them. Worse, our current president, and cabinet officers, and whole departments in the federal government ignore their oaths to defend the Constitution. And, thanks to the timid establishment Republicans have done so with impunity. When the Attorney General of the United States Eric Holder lied to Congress without consequences – other than being found in contempt of Congress – we have a coup going on. When the IRS can use its power to punish political enemies of the administration going so far as to destroy evidence, that is a revolution. And certainly when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton broke the law but is protected by the State Department, and the Department of Justice refuses to indict, we have a collapse of the rule of law. That is what happens in a coup. Certainly President Obama acts as if he doesn’t have to follow the Constitution. For now many of his more overt executive orders have been blocked by the courts, but as the progressive revolution grows in strength the Democrats appoint more and more judges who view the Constitution as a living document. It is doubtful that the progressive revolution is led by Obama or his handlers; they just take advantage of the increasing progressive power in the country. President Obama has an arrogance about him that drives him to foreshadow events like the IRS investigation, Hillary Clinton’s email investigation, and a possible rigging of the 2016 election. [Read Related Article: Did Obama Just Foreshadow a RIGGED Election Come November?] When he was elected he did the same thing. In 2008 he said, “We are five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America.” That is what he’s done and progressive will continue to try to do. Hillary, if elected will continue the progressive coup, possibly beyond our power to reverse. A Trump victory, like Ronald Reagan’s, will slow it down, but it must take a sustained effort to confront our loss of freedom.

It’s a Facebook post from an Weststar AutoPlex, a car dealership in Texas.  Considering the false narrative that police target blacks, the ad could be considered discriminatory. Nevertheless, what we know is this employee is yet another uninformed Liberal. And as is typical with Liberalism, this employee wants to profiteer on the lie. The employee whose name is supposedly “Eric” refuses to comment about the post. However the dealership posted this on Facebook, disagreeing with their employee:    I’m happy to report that Weststar AutoPlex fired the employee. I hope the company will make a significant donation to the local police department’s benevolent fund. As for the rest of America, you have witnessed what happens when we ignore the Left. Their views become pervasive, and we are left to deal with the inevitably horrible aftermath.   
North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory has given up on appealing to the federal government to reinforce his controversial HB2 law, which limits bathroom rights of trans citizens. McCrory officially dropped his lawsuit on Friday, which would have sought for federal courts to protect HB2, which has become exceedingly unpopular with many North Carolina citizens and lawmakers. Moral outrage over HB2 has taken a toll on North Carolina’s economy. The NBA pulled its upcoming All-Star Game out of Charlotte, saying in a statement that “We do not believe we can successfully host our All-Star festivities in Charlotte in the climate created by the current law.” The NCAA and the Atlantic Coast Conference have also moved their championship sporting events out of the state. Many celebrities and businesses have also practiced boycotts in protest of HB2. When the federal government threatened to withdraw funds from North Carolina, McCrory attempted to sue them. The Department of Justice countersued, intending to keep HB2 from being enforced on account of it being, according to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, “impermissibly discriminatory.” “This action is about a great deal more than just bathrooms,” Lynch said during a news conference. “This is about the dignity and respect we accord our fellow citizens and the laws that we, as a people and as a country, have enacted to protect them — indeed, to protect all of us.” McCrory wrote in court documents on Friday that he was dropping his lawsuit due to “substantial costs to the State,” writing that the lawsuit was in opposition to the “interests of judicial economy and efficiency.” While McCrory still supports HB2, he has since offered to repeal it on the one condition that the city of Charlotte repeals its local ordnance which protects LGBT community from discrimination. The Charlotte City Council has refused to do so.      
An officer-involved shooting that took place over the weekend in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has drawn heavy criticism from the usual suspects in the Black Lives Matter movement and their allies in the liberal media. Video of the incident filmed from a helicopter overhead appeared to some to show a 40-year-old unarmed black man named Terence Crutcher with his hands over his head being shot and killed by white police officer Betty Shelby, seemingly confirming the narrative that police routinely use excessive force and deadly violence against black men who pose no threat to them. But according to Tulsa World, evidence was discovered in Crutcher’s vehicle that, while unknown to the officers on the scene at the time, could nevertheless explain some of the man’s behavior that led to the officer feeling compelled to fire her weapon. Inside the vehicle beside which Crutcher was shot and killed was discovered a vial of PCP, a highly dangerous drug that can often create a psychopathic and violent state of mind in its users. In fact, there were numerous anecdotal accounts of individuals on PCP who become nearly impervious to pain, including gunshots, continuing to attack police officers and innocent bystanders alike even as they are being shot repeatedly in locations that would instantly drop an ordinary non-drug using suspect. Another matter that could very well help explain Crutcher’s attitude and actions during the incident was that he had a lengthy criminal rap sheet, including several counts of resisting arrest and prior drug convictions for which he had served time. It is also noteworthy that Crutcher had a warrant out for his arrest related to previous charges of resisting arrest and drug use, so he could have made clear through his words and attitude that he had no intention of peacefully being arrested or returning to prison. All of this is evidence that could conceivably corroborate the view of the officer on the scene who reportedly stated Crutcher looked “like a bad dude” who “could be on something.” It was expected that the medical examiner’s office will release a toxicology report detailing whether Crutcher had the powerful drug in his system at the time of the incident, along with the rest of the broader autopsy report. Please share this on Facebook and Twitter to help spread the word that PCP was found in Terence Crutcher’s vehicle, which may explain why his actions prompted a Tulsa police officer to shoot him. Do you think the presence of PCP in this man's car changes anything? Scroll down to comment below!
Through the course of this election season, a dark cloud has hung over Trump’s campaign – OK, many dark clouds. Dark, racist, xenophobic, lying clouds. But the one we’re referencing here is “what the hell is going on with his taxes?” The simple answer, as Trump revealed during the first presidential debate, is that The Donald simply hasn’t paid any federal income tax. Trump blamed Clinton for “squandering” taxpayer dollars, thus depriving us of much-needed infrastructure improvements — the kind Republicans like Trump typically vote against. Clinton, of course, took the opportunity to get in a dig about the GOP nominee’s own taxes. “Maybe because you haven’t paid any federal income tax in a lot of years,” Clinton shot back, expertly placing the bait in the trap. And, of course, she didn’t have to wait long for Trump to try to grab the cheese. To emphasize his point, he accidentally admitted that she’s exactly right: “It would be squandered too, believe me.” Pay attention to the word “would.” Trump would not have said that if he had paid taxes, which he called “smart” earlier in the debate. Is this the reason he doesn’t want to reveal his taxes, which he says he will release “against his lawyer’s wishes” if Clinton releases deleted emails? Does Trump not want the voting public to know that he’s a deadbeat who absolutely does not pay his fair share? When Trump says “believe me,” believe him — not that his tax dollars would be “squandered” but that he believes they “would” if he had paid any.

So, why should a student respect a teacher, when the Left say shooting police is ok? Thus, one should not be surprised when a student fights his teacher, as this student did.  A Philadelphia high school student is facing charges after video emerged of the boy getting into a violent fight with his teacher. The fight broke out at Lincoln High School on Monday, police say. The 16-year-old boy was late to class and began arguing with his 44-year-old teacher.  The confrontation soon moved out into the hallway, and developed into a fist fight. Grainy video of the bust-up quickly appeared on Facebook, filmed by other students who watched on in horror. Teachers have a tough job. The difficulty of teaching has been produced by Liberals.   
The nation’s top immigration officer said that the “11 million” undocumented aliens in the United States are “not going away,” are “in effect” citizens, and added that deporting the few the administration wants out is unpleasant: THIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED TREASON! SKIP TO THE 25:00 MARK FOR HIS COMMENTS ON ILLEGALS: Well, he just made 858 illegals from “hotbed” terror countries American citizens!  Hundreds of illegal immigrants from terrorist hotbeds who were supposed to have been deported were instead granted citizenship because Homeland Security didn’t have fingerprints on file to check their identity, the department’s inspector general said in a stunning new report Monday. At least two of those approved are now being investigated by the FBI for links to terrorism, investigators said. But in most cases, Homeland Security and federal prosecutors have let the illegal immigrants-turned-citizens get away with their potential fraud. Charges were brought in just two of the more than 800 cases identified. One of the persons granted citizenship through the error-riddled process is now a law enforcement officer, and three others worked in security-sensitive fields — including two who worked in sensitive areas at airports. “USCIS granted U.S. citizenship to at least 858 individuals ordered deported or removed under another identity when, during the naturalization process, their digital fingerprint records were not in the DHS digital fingerprint repository,” the inspector general said. The 858 cases involved people from so-called “special interest” countries, or from neighboring countries with major immigration fraud problems. Special interest countries are those places the government has identified as posing national security problems to the U.S. WHAT’S EVEN MORE UNBELIEVABLE: Investigators late last year identified another 953 cases that also seemed suspicious. The problem, according to the audit, is tens of thousands of illegal immigrants and criminal aliens whose files are so old that their fingerprints are still on paper cards. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that approves applications, wasn’t checking those paper-based files, so it didn’t know the aliens were ineligible or had been ordered kicked out of the country already. The inspector general said some fingerprints have been digitized, but it identified 148,000 aliens who have been ordered deported but whose fingerprints are not in the IDENT system the department uses for its fingerprint checks.

Charlotte riots have gone mad. The idiots there turned a “peaceful protest” into a firey loot-filled war zone all because a black cop shot a black thug with a gun. Go figure. They can’t even play the race card on this one, but they’ll still wreck a town for no reason. It makes sense now that the thugs in Charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction. What did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted? Nothing. But thugs wanna be thugs, so this is what they do. Rather than get a job and start a family, these losers knock up overweight women, make multuple kids, avoid childsupport payments like the plague, and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police. Ding ding! The looter alarm sounds and all the jobless, no-daddy, thug-a-bee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence. Why? Because another black man was an idiot who didn’t listen to police. That must mean it’s time for the Charlotte thugs to riot, loot, and lynch white people. These thugs are such losers that they assaulted a CNN reporter. The Charlotte thugs are so stupid that they don’t even know CNN is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every Black Lives Matter thug.  Madworld News – Rioters swarmed this man’s injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention. While they were addressing this situation, the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another. It’s okay with the BLM for a black thug to shoot another black man, but for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation, all hell breaks loose. This proves that they don’t know what they are rioting for, because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do, they wouldn’t be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed. If I saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured, then I’d probably pick them up. I know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that they’d be the first person to run towards me and lift me up. Black Lives Matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community. They’re the extremely violent thugs of America who, in between beating innocent people, also like to steal from stores and burn down businesses. Black Lives Matter supporters are the worst people of America. They’re a disgrace to humanity and they make black people look guilty by association. They call white people racist just because they’re white. They attack people just because they’re white. They call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment. How is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin? They can’t. But as we grow, we learn how to control our body, emotions, thoughts, and actions. I judge Black Lives Matter thugs and supporters on their actions and NOT the color of their skin. Based off what I’ve seen so far, I can proudly say F*ck Black Lives Matter and the hoopty they drove in on. 
I just could not stomach that debate last night. In the first ten minutes, I heard nothing but horrific socialist drivel from Hillary Clinton. Then Trump immediately chimed in with protectionism and tariffs. Both want socialist policies. It’s just stomach churning. Trump says he’ll release his tax returns if Clinton releases her deleted emails. We’ll never see either one. Both candidates say they are for taking Second Amendment rights from those on the No-Fly list which is heavily flawed and the whole concept is unconstitutional. However, the issue of ISIS was blood boiling. Trump screwed up big time: “No wonder you have been fighting ISIS your entire adult life,” he told Clinton. ISIS came into being around 2003 after the Iraq War. Unless she’s 13 years-old, that was just flat wrong. But even worse was Hillary’s faux paux where she blustered: “Take out ISIS in Iraq and squeeze them in Syria.” Exactly backwards and SEAL Team Six member Robert O’Neill called her on it.  From Independent Journal Review: During the debate on Monday night, Hillary weighed in on how we need to take down ISIS. She said we need to: “Take out ISIS in Iraq and squeeze them in Syria.” Veteran and SEAL Team Six member Robert O’Neill, who was part of the mission to kill Bin Laden, found something off about her comments. So he called her out for it:  We should wipe out ISIS everywhere, but especially in Syria where they are headquartered. They are spreading into Iraq, not the other way around. Clinton also seemed to intimate that she took out bin Laden. O’Neill shot him with the backup of his SEAL team… Clinton and Obama merely watched and had almost nothing to do with it. Lester Holt was a disgrace too. Not only did he not bring up Benghazi or the emails, he let both candidates blather on issues where they got multiple points wrong. It was a waste of a debate. Trump let Hillary slide on most issues. Both gave the same old talking points. One of them will be president and I guess we certainly get what we deserve in that department. We’ve richly earned it and begged for it. Don’t even get me started on Ted Cruz fawning over Trump’s lackluster performance last night. It’s disillusioning in the extreme. Cruz made that bed though and now he’s lying in it. I agree with SooperMexican: “There are no more heroes, there is only booze.” Looks like it’s going to be a predictable, boring apocalypse.    
The first presidential debate between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump was fully of fiery exchanges between the two candidates, as well as several questionable moments. NBC’s Lester Holt, the moderator for the debate, started getting flak before the debate was over after he repeatedly interrupted Trump to “fact-check” him, except that his fact-checks were more or less wrong. In one of the more contentious exchanges, Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from the beginning, but Trump continuously denied it, USA Politics Today reported. Rather than ask Clinton why she voted for the war, Holt continued to press Trump, saying that in an interview with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, Trump expressed his support for the war. After the debate was over, Cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that Trump wasn’t all gung-ho about invading Iraq before we went in — he had his reservations. “You know, what happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur? I mean he would go in and attack. He wouldn’t talk. I mean we have to, you know, it’s sort of like either do it or don’t do it,” Trump said. “Well, he’s (Bush) either got to do something or not do something perhaps. Because perhaps he shouldn’t be doing it yet. Perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations. You know, he’s under a lot of pressure,” said Trump, clearly unsure if invading Iraq was the right choice. You can see it here:  Instead of hammering Trump for his alleged “support” for the Iraq War, the moderator really should have asked Clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than Trump did. It shouldn’t surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smear Trump’s name. Luckily, Trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both Clinton and her media pals at the same time.

Lack of a border wall has allowed illegal drugs to decimate American society. Further, drugs have enriched foreigners beyond imagination. El Chapo was so wealthy, he had a private zoo. He was said to import animals from all over the world for his viewing pleasure. An empire built by drug money. Foreigners involved in drugs make billions of dollars, and impact governments with their corruption. It’s time America fight back, and Trump has a novel approach. In Trump’s recent immigration speech, he assured America that  Mexico would pay for his proposed border wall “100 percent.” The Mexican cartels may be how Trump plans to pay for the wall. According to LifeZette, a senior Trump campaign official, a president Trump would consider using assets seized from Mexican drug cartels to finance the construction. You have to admire this type of thinking; using funds seized from the illegal drug trade to stop the illegal border activities. A wall is not the only solution, but consider what the wall does. Trumps wall would cost around $8-10 billion dollars, money that could spur the economy. Next, the wall would lessen the flow of illegals into America. The objective of the wall is to force people to use our LEGAL immigration system. The plan reportedly would involve “joint border security fund,” in which seized assets from both sides of the border would be deposited and used to build and maintain the border wall “to the benefit of both Mexico and the United States.” The funding? The Justice Department seized $8.7 billion in drug money in 2015 alone, according to an audit. There’s no telling how much we’ve accumulated. Further, that figure doesn’t include assets seized by the Mexican government. The wall represents an attack on the drug cartels. These groups menace Mexico, and their crimes undoubtedly affect people in the United States. The wall begins the fight against corruption, drugs, human trafficking, illegal immigration, and terrorism in one fell swoop. “For decades, the illicit drug and arms trade has endangered and destroyed the lives of countless Mexicans and Americans,” an anonymous Trump immigration adviser said. “It would be sweet justice to use their illegal profits and property for something good.” Trump thinks differently than Washington. His type of thinking is what America needs. H/T Newsmax 
Kittens love saucers of milk and dogs love — what? Bones, of course! Do you give your dog bones? Many do. After finishing a good T-bone, why not give Fido a treat too, right? According to veterinary charity, the PDSA, owners should stop giving their dogs bones as they assert that bones may actually be killing dogs!   The organization says that splintered bones could be damaging the digestive system of dogs and that many dogs have had to undergo surgery to repair the damage or address blockages caused by the bones. They said that cooked bones pose the greatest risk of splintering, but that raw bones pose dangers as well. Rebecca Ashman, a senior vet with the PDSA, said: “Surgery is usually needed to remove any blockage and in some cases, the damage is so serious that it can be fatal. Similarly, if they swallow a large piece of rawhide chew this can become stuck and cause serious problems.” We all love to see our pets happy, but it may be time to find new toys for the pooches to chew on. A wagging tail is nice, but being sliced up or blocked by bits of bone seems like a particularly nasty ordeal. What do you think? Wil you heed the advice? Or is the concern overblown? 
It’s not what you think, but it’s just as gross.. during an interview with MSNBC’s Kassie Hunt, Libertarian Candidate Gary Johnson slipped out his tongue: Hunt: You think if you were able to get on the debate stage that you can pull even with Trump and Clinton? Johnson: I do and and it wouldn’t be you wouldn’t have anything to do with my debate performance either it would just be that people would recognize that there’s another choice and that there would be an examination of me and bill weld as as who we are and what we’ve done and (sticks out his tongue and keeps it out while making the rest of his statement so you can’t understand what he’s saying). When the clip ended, Ms. Hunt said to a stunned Mika Brzezinski “it’s never happened to me in an interview before.” I just hope this incident doesn’t give her nightmares (heck, I hope watching the interview doesn’t give ME nightmares). Since first watching this video I have been wracking my brain trying to figure out why a candidate for the presidency would make himself look so ridiculous in front of a national audience, less than 50 days before the election.

Early voting has begun in the battleground state of North Carolina, and after months of contentious litigation, it’s clear why Republicans wanted to squash it: returns are showing Democrats with an eight point advantage over Republicans. Data analysis from TargetSmart (who partnered with NBC News) shows that of the 4,000 plus presidential ballots that have been cast, 42 percent come from registered Democrats, 34 percent from Republicans, 25 percent from unaffiliated, and 1 percent from Libertarians. Contrast that to 2012, when Mitt Romney won North Carolina by two percent: in early voting that year in that state, Republicans held a five percent lead. Now Democrats hold an eight percent lead. In 2008, when President Obama won (by a slim margin of 0.33 percent), Democrats had an 11 point advantage. In 2004, Democrats had an 11 point advantage, but Kerry lost to Bush by 13 percent. So while it’s not set in stone that whoever accumulates the most early votes wins, the last two elections (in which early voting has increased tremendously) shows that is the case. Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight currently gives Clinton a 43 percent chance of winning North Carolina (and a 62 percent chance of winning the election overall). Clinton’s chances have gone up almost five percent in the last week, with one reason being a strong showing for Democrats in early voting. election model gives Clinton a 48 percent chance of winning North Carolina. Again, no wonder Governor Pat McCory, who is currently losing his re-election bid, and the GOP legislature wanted to do away with it. When Democrats get a head start, that usually means good news in November. Democrats shouldn’t get too comfortable. Although early voting points to a Democratic-leaning result, Republicans could very well (and chances are great) benefit from in person voting on November 8. President Obama never overcame Romney in the polls in the weeks leading up to the election, almost all the polls for the month of September favored Obama. With 45 days left until the election, anything can happen, so Democrats need to continue to mobilize, register, and get out the vote for not just early ballots, but for November 8. Rachel Maddow broke down the facts on her show:  
Another celebrity files for divorce, and this one shocked us more than all the rest! We have seen many couples file for divorce over the past several months but this one might have shocked us more than any other. TMZ reported that Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pritt, and the reasoning will astound you.  Apparently Angelina filed for the divorce on Monday and cited irreconcilable differences. The reasoning for the divorce request was that she didn’t appreciate the way Brad interacted with his children. We don’t really know the details behind the story, but what we do know is she wants OUT. Not only that but after filing for the divorce, Angelina requested full physical custody of all of their children. She did request that Brad get visitation rights, but she does NOT want to have joint physical custody of the children – assuming it has something to do with the conflict behind the divorce.  Sources close to the couple shared with TMZ that Angelina was not happy with the way that Brad was parenting their children. Apparently she was really disappointed in the methods he was using to parent. Laura Wasser who is ripping Jolie stated that the separation date was September 15, 2016. She stated that Jolie is not asking for spousal support. The couple has been together for over 12 years and has been married for 2!  We have been swooning over this couple since the debut of their big film “Mr. and Mrs. Smith” and it is heartbreaking to see them throw in the towel so soon. Their divorce was a total shock to all of us and we almost can’t believe it! They seemed so happy together! Please keep this family in your prayers as they trudge through this sad divorce. Especially for all of their beautiful children!  THIS IS SO HEARTBREAKING! I LOVE BRANGELINA!
A Donald Trump supporter showed up to the Hillary headquarters to survey the scene, but what he saw there was very very amusing. There was not a soul in sight. At Hillary Clinton’s Ohio campaign headquarters, volunteers were supposed to come in droves to knock on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee. Not to anyone’s surprise…the place looked about as desolate as water in the Nevada desert! In fact, the only Hillary supporters at the offices were the staff running the headquarters, and even then, makes you wonder how much they were paid. When the man disclosed who he was, a Trump supporter and asked where all the volunteers were, they quickly showed him the door. #Trump supporter goes to Hillary Clinton's Ohio offices, finds NO VOLUNTEERS. #MAGA pic.twitter.com/Kp4ta0hAng — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) September 18, 2016  Does Hillary really have zero enthusiasm among her supporters? It sure appears that way! I guess this shouldn’t be too shocking, considering Hillary had to pay people just to show up at her DNC convention a couple weeks ago. How very interesting, it’s a good thing this video was taken to show just how little people support this horrid woman. The people here seemed so happy that at least one person showed up, too bad it was Trump supporter! Love it.
A new video has emerged of the moments before and after police officers gunned down Keith Lamont Scott in North Carolina a few days ago. But the video, filmed by Scott’s wife Rakeyia, does not show the exact shooting and still leaves many questions unanswered. The police video of the shooting has been seen by his mourning relatives. “When told by police to exit his vehicle, Mr. Scott did so in a very calm, nonaggressive manner. While police did give him several commands, he did not aggressively approach them or raise his hands at members of law enforcement at any time. Mr. Scott’s hands were by his side, and he was slowly walking backwards” said family attorney Justin Bamberg. A picture has emerged that purports to show that Scott had a gun but it is still unclear who it belonged to or if it is a gun at all. In any case, North Carolina is an open-carry state with loose firearm laws, which more often than not seem to apply only to white people. In the video, the cops keep yelling “DROP THE GUN” while Rakeyia Scott keeps telling them that he doesn’t, and that what he does have is a traumatic brain injury and that he just took his medicine. “Don’t shoot him. Don’t shoot him. He has no weapon. He has no weapon. Don’t shoot him!” she pleads as officers yell – in an extremely unprofessional fashion – “DROP THE F*CKING GUN!” Why the officers were in a standoff with Scott at all is still unclear, as they were there to serve a warrant on someone else. But as happens far too often in the United States, Scott was executed without charges or trial. Protests by angry citizens demanding the release of the tapes continued into a third night as the governor declared a state of emergency and imposed a midnight to 6 am curfew. Police have continued to refuse to release the tapes as their “investigation” continues. Watch the video here. Viewer discretion is advised, as it is very disturbing and contains profane language: 
Make no mistake: the political differences ripping America apart are not merely political ones, but cultural ones as well. We are a culture at war with ourselves. We are separated into the “victim” role and the supposed “oppressor” role. Straights, whites and Christians are alleged to be the oppressors of all others and a new breed of radicalism has crept up to instill social warfare against these groups to further a self-pitying social and political agenda.   Black Lives Matter is a domestic hate group that furthers hatred for whites and for police officers in a way that the KKK has fostered hatred for minorities. Now, according to outspoken conservative Milo Yiannopoulos, it’s time to criminalize this hate group. “The left does this insane sleight of hand where they try to suggest not liking Black Lives Matter is the same thing as hating black people,” he said during his visit to the University of Houston for his “Dangerous Faggot” tour. “No one is stupid enough to believe that but they keep doing it,” he added. Yiannopoulos admitted that there are problems plaguing black communities, but suggested that BLM is not the solution, saying that a “violent movement that throws its toys out the pram and leaves black communities in ruins is [not] the answer to those problems.” “We are entering the black power phase of Black Lives Matter existence and it is crossing over into a terrorist organization. It’s time to criminalize it,” he stated. While it would be unconstitutional and wrong to criminalize political speech of any kind, we cannot escape the precedent that is already in place. The KKK is (thankfully) a tattered shred of what it used to be in terms of organization after it was ruled that their urging of violence in the name of hatred was a conspiratorial enterprise to commit lawlessness. While any bigot – black or white – should be free to spout off their nonsense, it is time to delegitimize these racists by holding them responsible for the violent conduct they encourage and urge.   
Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He’s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he’s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord. Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. “For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia” he tweeted in July. Now – brace yourself, this might come as a shock – it appears he’s been lying to us the whole time. An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. “The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with Donald Trump” says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group. Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to “large numbers” of Russian buyers – so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as “Little Moscow.” The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion. The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth. “I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…They don’t read books. They don’t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht” says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as “cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice.” Sound like anyone we know? When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and Trump himself. “We’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking” said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July. These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it’s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House. Watch ABC News’ report here: 
Barack Obama is planning on leaving office the same way he came in, making things all about him.  Speaking to a Congressional Black Caucus event on Saturday Night, the narcissist-in-chief said he would take it as a personal insult if Black voters didn’t turn out and vote for Hillary Clinton. I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election. You want to give me a good send-off, go vote. (…) Obama also sought to blunt Trump’s recent efforts to reach out to black voters, saying Trump at one point in the race had said there’s never been a worse time to be a black person. “I mean, he missed that whole civics lesson about slavery and Jim Crow, but we’ve got a museum for him to visit,” Obama said, a reference to next week’s opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture. “We will educate him.” Obama may have been referring to an ABC interview with Trump in 2015 when he asserted the nation’s first black president had done “nothing” for African-Americans. “They are worse now than just about ever,” he said. While it is not the worst time ever for African Americans, it’s been pretty bad.  The chart below uses Census Bureau data to show what has happened to household income African American and all U.S. households under Obama. It shows median household income for every year from Bush #43’s final year (2008-in red) through 2015. Each Obama year is compared to the final Bush year.

A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department’s motion to dismiss TheDCNF’s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also denied TheDCNF’s request to depose State Department officials. The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan. Leon has been impatient with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26 and the rest of them by Oct. 10. Bradley Moss, one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF, said “Judge Leon’s Order made clear his frustration with the State Department’s continued obstruction of the FOIA process. State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.” FBI Director James Comey told reporters in a July 7 news conference he regarded the former secretary of state as a “careless” federal official when she set up a private and unsecured email server in her New York home. Comey did not end up recommending prosecution of the former secretary of state. National Security Agency officials were aghast to learn early in Clinton’s term that she insisted on using an unsecured personal Blackberry phone within the confines of her State Department office. Unsecured digital devices are banned from the secretary’s office. State Department officials admitted in a July 29 response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the “courses were not completed” by Clinton or her aides. Department officials balked at searching computer hard drives in Clinton’s executive offices or in security offices where security awareness training is arranged for all of the department’s 45,000 employees and foreign service officers. In an Aug. 31 hearing, Leon told Justice Department Attorney Jason Lee the documents should be released before the November election. “I’m sure you can appreciate Mr. Lee, there is a certain time sensitivity on this issue,” Leon said. “We’re looking down the barrel of a presidential election from now in two months.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Youâve got to love Robert Reich. The former Secretary of Labor under future First Lady and former President Bill Clinton met a Trump supporter at a coffee shop and couldnât resist stopping for a moment to ruin the poor guyâs week by introducing him to a concept that is foreign to him: facts. âI finally found a Trump supporter â this morning when I went to buy coffee. (I noticed a Trump bumper sticker on his car.),â Reich writes in a Facebook post that has gone viral since he posted it Monday morning. Then he completely dismantled Trump â politely â before the guyâs very eyes: âHi,â I said. âNoticed your Trump bumper sticker.â âYup,â he said, a bit defensively. âI hope you donât mind my asking, but Iâm curious. Why are you supporting him?â âI know heâs a little bit much,â said the Trump supporter. âBut heâs a successful businessman. And we need a successful businessman as president.â âHow do you know heâs a successful businessman?â I asked. âBecause heâs made a fortune.â âHas he really?â I asked. âOf course. Forbes magazine says heâs worth four and a half billion.â âThat doesnât mean heâs been a success,â I said. âIn my book it does,â said the Trump supporter. âYou know, in 1976, when Trump was just starting his career, he said he was worth about $200 million,â I said. âMost of that was from his father.â âThat just proves my point,â said the Trump supporter. âHe turned that $200 million into four and a half billion. Brilliant man.â âBut if he had just put that $200 million into an index fund and reinvested the dividends, heâd be worth twelve billion today,â I said. The Trump supporter went silent. âAnd he got about $850 million in tax subsidies, just in New York alone,â I said. More silence. âHeâs not a businessman,âÂ Reich concluded. âHeâs a con man. âHope you enjoy your coffee.â While itâs unlikely that Reich managed to change the Trump fanâs mind â or even reach him on a level that matters â he surely left the guyÂ steaming more than a freshly-brewed cup of go-go- juice. Oh, to be a fly on the wall during that conversation! 
The Drudge Report has gained access to the rules for the upcoming Mega-Debate between Hillary and Trump. Hillary’s always angling for an advantage, and when it comes to the mainstream media, Hillary usually gets exactly what she wants. It looks like she’ll get a custom podium to help her with the height advantage, but when it comes to coughing up a lung, Hillary’s on her own. Let’s hope for Hillary’s sake, she’s able to keep the guy with the diazinon pen close to the stage in case “unfit to run for office Hillary” has another “pneumonia-related incident” like the one on 911…  DEBATE RULES: NO COUGHING BREAKS **Exclusive** Fri Sep 23 2016 11:30:40 ET If presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton slips into a coughing fit or any other medical crisis during Monday’s high-stakes debate, she will have to power through, the DRUDGE REPORT has learned! “There are no commercial breaks,” a commission source explains. “Period.” Debate moderator Lester Holt does not have the authority to cut away from the stage during the epic 90-minute showdown. And microphone audio for either of the candidates is not to be manipulated. Clinton has experienced severe coughing episodes throughout the election year. During a Labor Day campaign stop she suffered a 4-minute choking marathon. Monday’s throwdown could top out at 100 million viewers, making it the biggest political event in history. EDITOR’S NOTE: The presidential debate commission settled an early flashpoint when Clinton demanded a step-stool at the podium to add height to her 5’4″ frame. Campaign Chairman John Podesta expressed concern that Hillary would be dwarfed by 6’2″ Trump. The request was quickly rejected. The commission is allowing for a custom-made podium, which will accommodate the difference in stature. 
  After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past. The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type. Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does. Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself. The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates? What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton. The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In. It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity. If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential. The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

Carrie Underwood got candid with her fans, and we love her for it. If anyone is the queen of modern-day country music, it’s Carrie Underwood. She’s got it all and more! One thing we absolutely love about Carrie Underwood is how candid she is with all of us. She’s never afraid to be real and tell people how life really is. She shares with us things that she’s learned from being a wife, a mom, a friend and a daughter. All the things that she wished she was told, she shares. And then some.  She sticks up for people who are being bullied, and fights for the things she believes in. All in all, Carrie shows us what it looks like to be a good and graceful leader. Recently Underwood was in Nashville performing one of her shows. During the middle of it, she paused to talk about a great woman and role model in the country music industry, Dolly Parton. Underwood then went on to sing one Parton’s hit songs, ‘I Will Always Love You.’ After she was done with the beautiful rendition, she paused to thank a special group of people in her life. Underwood explained that she couldn’t make it through certain times without strong women helping and guiding her along the way. “I have learned a lot about a whole incredible group of amazing women over the past year and a half of my life. I’ve gained just an incredible appreciation for moms — for my own mother and for the mothers of my friends and just people that I know that have had kids. I never knew what it was like to just juggle everything and try to be everything to everyone.” All of those words were said through tears streaming down the star’s face. She was genuine and heartfelt about everything she was saying. You can tell that she’s been impacted tremendously by this group of ladies.  After she said all of that, she encouraged all of her fans. She let everyone know that she appreciates them and their support so much. Then she laughed as she let the crowd know that she may not make it through her next song, which was “What I Never Knew I Always Wanted.” Carrie never fails to make every moment real and heartfelt. It’s something that we as fans absolutely adore about her. She has never let her fame and success get in the way of showing love, kindness and gratefulness to everyone. Watch the amazing moment below!  We love you, Carrie!!

An explosion in New Jersey has gone largely unreported due to a similar explosion that took place eleven hours later in Chelsea, Manhattan, New York City. The charity run in New Jersey was cancelled after an explosion took place in Seaside Park, New Jersey. The explosion took place in a garbage can which is where two unexploded pipe bombs were later found. Authorities have told residents to stay inside their homes and away from the area the race was supposed to take place. Unfortunately, the explosion took place at 9:35 A.M. on Saturday morning, just yesterday. It was on the corner of D Street and Ocean Avenue right before the Seaside Park Semper Five 5K Charity Run. Luckily, nobody was injured or hurt and no structures had serious damage. Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com A Facebook post on the explosion states, “Out of extreme precaution, this year’s Seaside Semper Five has been canceled due to an unidentified suspicious backpack found at the race site. The safety and security of our participants, spectators, staff and volunteers is of utmost importance. We’d like to thank the Seaside Park Police Department, all the first responders and emergency personnel for their quick action. Further details will be posted when available. Thank you for your understanding.” Apparently, Fox News is the only outlet interested in getting the truth out there.  Another incident also took place in Minnesota as well. However, all three incidents do not appear to be connected as the authorities have said. They do appear to have been premeditated and planned but it is unknown who the culprit is, their motives or why they chose the areas they did. Officials have also noted that as of now their appears to be no indication this is an act of terrorism. The most important thing is nobody in any of the incidents have been seriously or permanently injured or killed. The situation as of now appears to be under control. 
Donald Trump’s lies are catching up to him one by one, and the latest person to call him out is Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and biographer David Cay Johnston. Some of you may not know who Johnston is, but he is the author behind so he knows quite a bit about who the erratic business mogul is and isn’t. In a newly released video, Johnston claims that there is absolutely no proof that Trump is the billionaire he says he is – adding another layer of deceit and fraud to Trump’s already horrendous track record. The clip was published by , where Johnston goes through Trump’s bragging claims and compares them to the actual data on the business mogul’s court records and bank filings. For example, Johnston says that last year, Trump said his net worth was $8.7 billion, $10 billion, $11 billion and higher, “even though there was nothing going on in the economy that would suggest that kind of gyrations of net worth.” The truth is, Trump is lying though his teeth. Johnston said: “The fact of the matter is that Donald Trump just makes it up.” Johnston also brought up a court testimony where Trump said he uses his gut “feelings” and “emotional state” to determine his net worth. Johnston joked about how “nuts” it was, and imitated Trump’s strategy: “By the way, I’m having a great day today. I think my net worth must be at least a billion dollars.” Johnston has been trying to get America to believe that Trump’s billionaire status was fake since 1990. During that time, a net worth statement by Trump’s bankers said that the GOP nominee’s net worth was actually  $295 million. Johnston is still standing by the claim that Trump isn’t as successful as he seems, and continues to insist that although Trump is well off, there is “no evidence that he is a billionaire.” You can watch Johnston call out Trump’s lies below:  
Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s infamous line, “we have nothing to fear but fear itself,” the Pope chastised fear-based media. Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of “terrorism” and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday. Spreading rumors is an example of “terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue”, he said. “This is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.” Source: Reuters Now, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy’s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I’m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that’s what has given us Donald Trump. Crime in the nation is down. An American’s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans: Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant. Source: The Atlantic Sure, that’s about Donald Trump and the Pope wasn’t directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network. lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, they’ve succeeded. 
There have been so many deaths in country music over the past couple of months, and we thought that we were going to have to say goodbye to another legend Saturday night. It was a normal Saturday night at the Cornstock Concert on the Hill in Garnett, Kansas until Eddie Montgomery collapsed on stage in the middle of his performance. Many of you probably know the country star from the country duo Montgomery Gentry.  Montgomery Gentry was founded in 1999 when Eddie Montgomery and Troy Gentry came together and graced us all with their talents. The country duo has released 6 studio albums since their big debut and has had several No. 1 hits such as “If You Ever Stop Loving Me”, “Something to Be Proud Of”, “Lucky Man”, “Back When I Knew It All” and “Roll with Me”. The duo rose to fame shortly after the start of their career and they have continued to be a country favorite over the years. The duo was performing at their concert Saturday (September 24th) when Eddie Montgomery collapsed on the stage.  The medics immediately rushed to the stage and it was just moments later that he was walking off. The concert continued as Troy Gentry lead the band out. It was just four songs later that Eddie walked back out on the stage and apparently told the audience that he was not feeling well all day and that he was very dehydrated. And just like anything else, rumors started. Fans all over were saying that Eddie had a heart attack right there on stage. Apparently, they weren’t listening or they didn’t believe that he was actually dehydrated. The next morning on the duo’s Twitter they announced that Eddie was doing well and that it was definitely not a heart attack. There are false reports floating around that Eddie had a heart attack last night. NOT TRUE. He was dehydrated and returned to the stage. — Montgomery Gentry (@mgunderground) September 25, 2016  Eddie wanted to reassure everyone that he was indeed alive and that he didn’t have a heart attack, so a couple of hours after the initial post he took it upon himself to post a photo of him and his wife. Not only that, but he made sure that all of his fans knew that he was drinking PLENTY of water – doing his best to prevent the same thing from happening again. Eddie and Jennifer send their regards from Key West and thanks for all of the prayers and well wishes. And he's drinking plenty of H20! pic.twitter.com/xCJlTZCIHX — Montgomery Gentry (@mgunderground) September 25, 2016  We are so glad that Eddie is feeling better! I can’t imagine how scary this was for him and his fans!  We are praying for you Eddie!
It looks like FBI Director James Comey is sitting in a pot of hot water and the temperature is steadily being increased. He let Hillary Clinton skate completely on the email scandal. He even said she was lying and was guilty, but let her off anyway. No one can figure out why either. Comey released highly redacted notes of his interview with Hillary Clinton. They were practically useless. Attorney General Loretta Lynch is just as complicit for meeting with Bill Clinton just before Hillary testified to the FBI. Obviously, briefing him on what Hillary should and should not say. Congress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton’s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. In a further attempt to get Comey to comply, Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents.  From the Independent Journal Review: The FBI Director’s recommendation to the Attorney General not to indict Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for legal infractions with her private email server while at the State Department still has many political observers shaking their heads over the obvious legal double standard. The decision-making of FBI Director Comey, who recently sent highly redacted notes of his interview process and investigation of Hillary Clinton, and Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who had a private meeting with Bill Clinton prior to her case being dismissed, have been highly scrutinized. After grilling Comey on the Hill, Congress requested that the director deliver certain documents so lawmakers could better understand the scope and breadth of Hillary Clinton’s extra-legal email activities. The director has reportedly failed to deliver, and now Congress is once again trying to get transparency. The Washington Examiner reported: House Committee on Science, Space and Technology Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, subpoenaed FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday for documents and information related to the security of the private email account and server Hillary Clinton used when she led the State Department. Smith asked Comey for the documents in a Sept. 9 letter, but then issued the subpoena after Comey failed to comply with the request. “The committee continues to have questions about the structure and security of the email system used by former Secretary Clinton and whether she and her staff employed cybersecurity standards required by FISMA,” the statement from the committee read. But I doubt they will ever get the answers they are seeking… they will get stonewalled by the Obama Administration, the FBI and the Clintons, just as they always do. We seem to no longer have three functioning separate branches of government in this nation. The Executive Branch seems to rule over all now, making the Judicial Branch submissive to it and the Legislative Branch all but irrelevant. There is no better example of that than the corruption surrounding Hillary Clinton.  
New Jersey’s despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival. Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the “Bridgegate” scandal by a judge, as WNYC reports: The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict. Chris Christie is also Republican Presidential’s nominee Donald Trump’s transition team chairperson. Just four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person  in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world’s busiest bridges. Governor Christie was Trump’s most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major “conservative” Republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trump’s benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor. Famously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. It’s have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governor’s the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town. Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages. The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration’s bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this year’s Republican Presidential campaign. Watch his shame: 
From the Daily Caller News Foundation: Teachers at a school in Texas might be armed and are willing to use whatever force needed to protect students, according to a sign posted outside the school district. Medina Independent School District placed a sign in front of one of its entrances Sept. 14 to warn people that teachers might be armed, reports CNN. “Please be aware that the staff at Medina ISD may be armed and will use whatever force is necessary to protect our students,” the sign says. The warning serves as a good way to drive away potential threats, according to the school’s superintendent. “I think that anybody who might have a thought about harming someone in mind might think twice about it,” Superintendent Penny White said, according to KSAT 12. “We’re 20 minutes or 25 minutes from Bandera. That’s our closest law enforcement.” White and Dr. James Lindstrom, a school board member, said no specific event spurred the sign, Lindstrom added it was posted due to the “the general environment nationally.” Jillian Sides, a mother with two sons at the school, thought the sign was a good way to keep away threats. “Schools have been a target for, for lack of a better word, crazy people, and I’m perfectly fine with it,” she told KSAT. Another mother disagreed, believing the sign could bring trouble. “I don’t know if that’s asking for trouble or not. I mean, you post a sign like that, it may bring trouble, unfortunately,” said Alisha Reagan, a mother of a third-grader. White would not name the teachers, if any, who are armed. The school plans to post two additional signs at other school entrances.

Last week I wrote an article titled “Donald Trump’s Amazing Week” which must have been incredibly annoying to liberals and “Never Trumpers” everywhere. Guess what? This past week has been even better for the 2016 Republican nominee for president, the man whose candidacy was considered a vanity exercise a year and a half ago. Well no one is laughing anymore. The latest round of polls shows that the support for the Trump presidency is growing rapidly. The latest Fox News Poll, which was taken from September 11-14, shows Donald Trump polling at 46%, a one-point lead over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at 45%.  The LA Times/USC poll taken from September 9-15 shows Trump at 47% with a six-point lead over Clinton at 41%. The gap between the two candidates is also narrowing in the key battleground states. The Suffolk University Poll which was taken from September 12-14 shows Trump at 42%, leading by 3 points with Clinton at 39%. The CNN/ORC poll, which was taken September 7-12 shows Trump with a 4-point lead over Clinton in Florida. Clinton still has about a 3-5 point lead over Trump in other key battleground states, including Pennsylvania and Michigan, but those gaps are getting narrower every day. Other states such as Nevada and New Hampshire which were initially perceived to be likely wins for Clinton have moved to the “toss up state” category. Donald Trump also continued his efforts to layout his policy framework with the introduction of another signature platform, his childcare plan at a speech in Aston PA, just outside of Philadelphia.  Spearheaded by his daughter Ivanka Trump, Trump’s childcare policy offers something for everyone across the economic spectrum.  The plan offers six weeks paid maternity leave to all mothers who do not receive this benefit through their employers. This benefit will be funded by closing gaps in our existing unemployment insurance program.  Lower income families will also benefit from the plan’s offering of childcare rebates through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program up to $1,200 per year.  Middle class families will benefit from being able to fully deduct all childcare expense on their tax returns.  Families will also have the ability to establish Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs) to put money aside tax free for childcare. Low income families will receive a 50% match of the first $1000 deposited per year, generating up to an additional $500 per eligible family per year. DCSAs can be applied to pay for childcare, after school enrichment programs and school choice. Families can also use the funds in a DCSA to care for an elderly parent’s expenses including in home nursing and long-term care.  Finally, Trump’s childcare plan provides a tax deduction for stay-at-home parents, effectively eliminating the tax punishment for a parent’s decision to leave the workforce to be a full time caregiver for child or an elderly parent. Donald Trump followed his childcare policy speech with another economics speech to the Economic Club of New York which includes some of New York’s most powerful movers and shakers in the world of business and finance. Trump’s excellent week continued with his visit to the Dr. Oz Show where he released a letter from his long term doctor revealing the results of his most recent medical visit and other relevant pieces of his medical history. Other than carrying an extra 15-20 pounds, Trump appears to be in excellent health. Of course, Trump’s unveiling his medical records on a television show comes on the heels of the recent concerns about Hillary Clinton’s health following her fainting at last week’s September 11 memorial event and the subsequent revelation that she was suffering from pneumonia. Again, only Donald Trump can turn the literal opening of an envelope into an event. Well, it is an event alright particularly if that envelope is opened on The Dr. Oz Show, a program which is reportedly watched by four million viewers daily with a large percentage of female viewers. During the one hour program, the discussion of Trump’s health was followed by the appearance of Ivanka Trump who was able to deliver yet another pitch about the newly announced childcare proposal to the aforementioned audience of women.  So yes, somehow all this concern about Hillary Clinton’s health and capacity to serve as president has created multiple free publicity events for Donald Trump. Trump followed up the Dr. Oz interview with a visit to the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. During the visit, Trump permitted the late night comedian to do something “unpresidential”. That is to say, he told Fallon that he could “mess up his hair”.  While most pundits would speculate that the moment was completely pre-planned,  the fact that Trump said “yes” to the display speaks volumes.  He demonstrated that he has the ability to laugh at himself and that he is not afraid to have a bad picture taken. Furthermore, The Tonight Show is popular with Democrats and millennials of all political persuasions. Once again, Trump had an opportunity to make a connection with millions of people who more than likely were not on the “Trump Train”.  Oh and one more thing, by letting Jimmy Fallon touch his hair on national television, Trump has finally set to rest all rumors that his hair is not his.  However small, it’s another check mark in the honesty and transparency box. Now if all of this was not enough, Donald Trump capped his week off with an opening event ceremony at his new hotel in the former post office site in Washington DC where he received endorsements from military flag officers and fourteen Medal of Honor recipients.  Trump used the event to not only promote his hotel project as being completed “two years early and under budget”, a metaphor for how he would manage the US economy, he also seized the moment to put an end to the “birther issue”.  Trump took the microphone and said “Not to mention her in the same breath,” (as the Medal of Honor recipients who had just endorsed him) “Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it,” he said. “President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.” Trump said. Once again, political correctness be damned, Donald Trump has had another “amazing week.”  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.
I’m probably going to a very not good place for laughing at this, but I can’t help that it’s so dang funny!  There has been a theory floating around that Hillary Clinton is just a robot disguised as a human. While that may seem out-of-this-world ridiculous, remember that she admitted to “short-circuiting.” I’m fairly confident that this is not a term that people often use to describe their forgetting something of importance. And then, adding to the pile of evidence to validate this theory is this little gem picked up from the Twitterverse:  Some guy right in Hillary’s face: HILLARY FOR PRISON Hillary: LET’S MAKE IT HAPPEN I almost feel sorry for her https://t.co/CKfdSuASHB — Jenna Abrams (@Jenn_Abrams) September 18, 2016   When some man yells “Hillary For Prison!” right in her face, Hillary responds with a strangely enthusiastic “Let’s make it happen!” Now I’ve never been to prison so I’m not entirely confident about this, but it would seem that it’s not a place that you would be that excited to go to. If that doesn’t have you rolling on the floor with laughter, this screengrab might:  Awesome. Just… awesome.  
On the topic of climate change, Hillary Clinton seems more knowledgeable of Donald Trump’s words than he does. Earlier in Monday night’s presidential debate at Hofstra University, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton pointed out that the GOP nominee previously said that climate change was a hoax created by the Chinese. Trump immediately responded, saying, “I did not. I do not say that.” But in 2012, long before he was running for the White House, Trump tweeted that exact statement. The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012  The debate over whether or not Trump made that statement happened earlier in the campaign, when Clinton referenced the statement in a June speech. Politifact confirmed the claim as true, referencing Trump’s 2012 tweet.          
The New York Times has joined a number of other major print media publications in denouncing Donald Trump as a liar. Writers at Quartz have noted that “in at least five articles in the New York Times on Sept. 17, including the lead story in the print edition, the words “lie,” “false,” “falsely claimed” and “untrue” appeared in headlines, lead paragraphs, and top sections of the paper’s Trump coverage. Executive editor Dean Baquet” said that “I think our investigative work—see [the Sept. 17] story on Trump’s tax breaks—has always been hard hitting. But we have decided to be more direct in calling things out when a candidate actually lies…The birther issue represents, well, outright lying. And he lied over a long period. It is a real word and we will use it when warranted.” Hopefully this dramatic shift in tone will be a cue to the rest of the mainstream media to abandon their insistence on treating Trump’s statements with more legitimacy than they deserve out of a desire to remain impartial. The right-wing has been exploiting that impartiality for far too long. The Republican primary debates were filled with outright falsehoods and imaginary statistics that largely went unchallenged; and Trump’s entire campaign is based on statements which are simply untrue. But it appears that Trump’s attempt to gaslight the nation and convince us that it was actually Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton that created the “birther” myth (which is decidedly false) was the last straw for the highly respected editors at the New York Times.
Donald Trump, Jr. seems to have taken over as his father’s campaign’s Supervisor of Offensive Posts, particularly with some of his most recent tweets. One was of a bowl of Skittles, and asked us the really asinine question of whether we’d eat those Skittles if we knew three of them were poisoned, but not which ones. He’s (rightfully) caught an awful lot of flack for that, but he likely didn’t expect to catch it from the man who took that photo. He probably also didn’t expect the photographer to be who he is: A refugee living in the U.K. David Kittos fled Turkish occupation of Cyprus in the 1970s and has been living in the U.K. ever since. He is (quite understandably) angry by Trump Jr.’s misappropriation of his image to promote a xenophobic, racist and anti-refugee policy: “This was not done with my permission, I don’t support his politics and I would never take his money to use it. In 1974, when I was six-years old, I was a refugee from the Turkish occupation of Cyprus so I would never approve the use of this image against refugees.” Oops. That’s only a minor faux pas – oh wait. It’s a major embarrassment to use an image that originates with a refugee to speak out against refugees. Kittos took the picture six years ago in his studio while he was experimenting with a specific type of flash. He’s not on Twitter, but friends familiar with his work let him know of this unauthorized and offensive use of one of his photos, which does appear on Flickr. Just is up with this campaign acting like copyright only applies to other people? We digress. Anyway. Kittos’ photo was never intended for political use and he certainly would never release it or sell it for such usage. Trump Jr. and others, like the disgraceful former Congresscritter Joe Walsh, don’t seem to care, though, as long as they can make their point that refugees are dangerous. Wrigley, the makers of Skittles candy, also upbraided Trump Jr. for his baloney: “Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don’t feel it is an appropriate analogy. We will respectfully refrain from further commentary as anything we say could be misinterpreted as marketing.” For his part, Kittos isn’t sure if he’s going to pursue legal action. However, he did say: “I would like the Trump campaign to delete the image, but they are probably not interested in what I have to say. I was thinking about getting lawyers involved but I don’t know if I have the patience. This isn’t about the money for me. They could have just bought a cheap image from a micro stock library. This is pure greed from them. I don’t think they care about my feelings. They should not be stealing an image full stop.” And they definitely need to learn how to source copyrighted work if they’re the so-called “law and order campaign” that they claim to be. But that’s beside the point. Kittos is, himself, a refugee. It’s natural that he would feel especially upset by this use of his image. It also speaks to the insanely tone-deaf nature of the Trump campaign. They don’t care about such trivia as long as their point is made.

In the wake of the bombs found in the Chelsea area of New York, Seaside Heights, and Elizabeth, NJ, we’ve received a letter from a Marine, known only as “J”, that wanted his voice heard, amidst the sea of political nonsense on the mainstream media. Here it is, unedited. Dear Obama, Hillary, and liberals scared of the “T” word, I’ve served my entire adult life in the United States Marine Corps, and I love this country, but that’s not important, because a man is judged in life by his actions, not his words. When you were given the task of protecting America, instead of giving people the tools to do it themselves, you treated them like children that couldn’t be trusted with their own safety. You stripped away their freedoms and promised them that you had everything under control. You allowed un-vetted, America-hating refugees that pledged allegiance to ISIS and other radical regimes and ideologies to walk freely, while they plotted to destroy the country from within. That’s exactly how you topple an empire without firing a single shot, and you’re falling for it like a bunch of amateurs. Repeat after me: You are not equipped to handle this. You’ve built your entire agenda on the false notion that fundamentalist Muslims either don’t exist, or can’t harm us because they’re on the other side of the world. Well, take a wild guess what happens when you import them to our shores and tell them that anyone criticizing Islam should be shunned, no matter how suspicious they act. It’s how you end up with attacks like the one in San Bernardino, and how you get bombings in New York City, Elizabeth, and Seaside Heights, where Marines were staging a summer run for charity, with the exact same IEDs I’ve seen used to kill my brothers and sisters while serving in the Middle East. When George W. Bush said “Fight them over there so we don’t have to fight them here,” this is what he was talking about. The fight is here, and you might as well have sent them a written invitation. If you’re too scared to say it, I will: These bombings were a textbook definition of terrorism. It doesn’t get any more clear, and every minute that goes by that you ignore it, the men willing to kill innocent people grow stronger. These attacks were enacted by those who want to literally terrorize our way of life. They hate our freedoms, and want – above all else –  to control us, much in the way that you want to control our actions, speech, and political motivations. But America is better than that. We’re not children that need to be led by the hand into a den of wolves. We’re the country of prosperity, strength, and built on the idea that we don’t take threats kindly. We have the most advanced military in the world, and a God-fearing citizenry that, unlike your liberal friends, won’t kneel to evil men. We’re the real America that you’re actively trying to silence, that gets things done by working together and ensuring that anyone coming in to the country better have a damn good reason for doing it. We support the police, that put their lives on the line when disarming a bomb, despite your best efforts to call them all racist monsters. We’re the ones going to work to keep the country running while the entitled brats that voted for you go on social media and complain about why life isn’t fair. We are the people you come running to when shit hits the fan, and we will stand no longer while you try to destroy this country by kowtowing to terrorists and fill pointless speeches with nothing but empty words and lies to the America public. The way I see it, this leaves you with three options: Take action, step down, or let America run over you. The choice is yours. Just don’t say I didn’t warn you. -J   
Early on in tonight’s presidential debate Donald Trump himself admitted that he was shedding all pretense of reality in his attacks on Hillary Clinton, replying “Why not?” in response to Clinton’s sarcastic comment that Mr. Trump might as well “blame [her] for anything that’s happened ever.” He quickly lived up to his own idiotic remark, most delusionally by claiming that Mrs. Clinton had been “fighting ISIS for 30 years” despite the fact that ISIS has only existed since 2013. In the real world, the Islamic State was founded in 2013 and only acquired widespread notice with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s declaration of a caliphate in June of 2014, three and a half years ago. Since then, of course, Hillary Clinton and the rest of the Obama administration have worked tirelessly to combat the threat of ISIS both in the Middle East and abroad, and America’s military efforts have resulted in tremendous setbacks for the militant group in terms of both territory lost and fighters killed. So while Trump’s suggestion is that Clinton has done nothing against ISIS in thirty years of work, the reality is that she and the Obama administration have dealt a tremendous blow to the group in the few years since it was founded. In an attempt to be generous to Trump’s lies, it should be noted that the organization currently known as ISIS grew out of the earlier Al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia (AQAM), which was founded in 2004 to fight the American-led invasion and occupation of Iraq. So, at best, ISIS has been around for twelve years, but AQAM, in its alliance with the ideologically distinct Al-Qaeda, was tremendously different than the ISIS of today. To go back 30 years in the history of jihad would take us to 1986, when various jihadist groups in Afghanistan, including those of Osama bin Laden’s, were being funded and trained by Ronald Reagan’s CIA. It was Bill Clinton’s administration that first recognized jihadism as a large-scale threat, and his CIA amassed a litany of intelligence on al-Qaeda, all of which was ignored by the Bush administration. Trump’s claim that ISIS has existed for thirty years demonstrates his shocking ignorance of the most basic elements of global politics, and his underlying claim that Democrats are “weak” on jihadism is objectively backwards.
The National Association of Secretaries of State have told Congress to step back and let them handle it. They assure Congress that the election mechanism is secure. The data breaches have been about voter databases and NOT the election machines. The polling system is a closed system and not open to hacking. To date there have been zero occurrences.  As Written By Reid Wilson for The Hill: State officials are reassuring members of Congress that the integrity of November’s elections is secure amid growing concerns over cyberattacks by foreign actors tied to Russia. In an open letter to Congress, the National Association of Secretaries of State warns against damaging public confidence in the electoral process. The group, made up of bipartisan election administrators across the nation, says security measures currently in place are sufficient to guarantee an accurate vote count. Vote-counting systems “have their own fail-safes and contingency solutions that would make it highly difficult to leverage them for changing outcomes,” the association said. “Poll books, printed records, back-ups and back-ups of back-ups all provide multiple layers of security around this part of the process.” The association said there is no fix-all to guard against all cyberattacks but pointed out that recent hacks of voter registration systems in Arizona and Illinois are unconnected to separate systems that tally votes. The decentralized nature of American election administration acts as its own safeguard, the association said. In November, Americans will vote at hundreds of thousands of polling locations, and those votes are counted by more than 9,000 election administrators, making large-scale hacking almost impossible, it added. What’s more, voting machines themselves are not connected to the internet, providing more security. “There is no evidence that ballot manipulation has ever occurred in the U.S. via…… Full Story Here: State officials warn Congress against ‘rigged election’ talk | TheHill

You can believe this or not it is completely up to you. The polls are skewered and the betting odds seem to be fixed on Hillary Clinton. Are we fighting another losing battle in getting a republican back in the White House? Here’s what Fox News’ John Stossel had to say.   FBN’s John Stossel goes “On the Record” to size up Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump and gives the currents odds in Vegas.Watch the clip above and sound off below!   As seen first on Fox News: Who Do the Odds Favor in November? Stossel Reveals Which Candidate Most People Are Betting On

This was not the Ruffling of Trump’s hair moment she was looking for.  She got owned! ‘I’d love to meet the person who makes your pantsuits’ he said. ‘How does Obama like his coffee?’ ‘I really regret doing this’ she said. ‘Are you Down with TPP?’ The sponsor break was PERFECT! Share to someone who needs a good laugh … at Hillary’s expense! 
Texas Senator Ted Cruz recognizes that 2016 is not his year. Despite giving a valiant effort, his presidential campaign ultimately succumbed to populist appeal and the ever-increasing burden of slander.   Because of this, the principled lawmaker ruffled GOP feathers when at the RNC convention, he urged people to vote their conscience and noticeably refrained from offering an endorsement of Donald Trump, the perpetrator of the slander on the campaign trail. For this, Cruz was vilified by many who seemingly never stopped and questioned why when Cruz urged voting for a true conservative, they assumed he was not speaking about the chosen candidate, Trump. After the dust settled, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus stated that those who have not endorsed the Republican nominee may find themselves bereft of GOP support in the future if they intend to mount another presidential run – a run that is highly likely for Cruz. Because of this pressure, Cruz relented to the power of the GOP and offered his endorsement of Trump on Friday, explaining six policy points guiding his decision in a Facebook post. Check it out: This election is unlike any other in our nation’s history. Like many other voters, I have struggled to determine the right course of action in this general election. In Cleveland, I urged voters, “please, don’t stay home in November. Stand, and speak, and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket whom you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution.” After many months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, I have decided that on Election Day, I will vote for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump. I’ve made this decision for two reasons. First, last year, I promised to support the Republican nominee. And I intend to keep my word. Second, even though I have had areas of significant disagreement with our nominee, by any measure Hillary Clinton is wholly unacceptable — that’s why I have always been #NeverHillary. Six key policy differences inform my decision. First, and most important, the Supreme Court. For anyone concerned about the Bill of Rights — free speech, religious liberty, the Second Amendment — the Court hangs in the balance. I have spent my professional career fighting before the Court to defend the Constitution. We are only one justice away from losing our most basic rights, and the next president will appoint as many as four new justices. We know, without a doubt, that every Clinton appointee would be a left-wing ideologue. Trump, in contrast, has promised to appoint justices “in the mold of Scalia.” For some time, I have been seeking greater specificity on this issue, and today the Trump campaign provided that, releasing a very strong list of potential Supreme Court nominees — including Sen. Mike Lee, who would make an extraordinary justice — and making an explicit commitment to nominate only from that list. This commitment matters, and it provides a serious reason for voters to choose to support Trump. Second, Obamacare. The failed healthcare law is hurting millions of Americans. If Republicans hold Congress, leadership has committed to passing legislation repealing Obamacare. Clinton, we know beyond a shadow of doubt, would veto that legislation. Trump has said he would sign it. Third, energy. Clinton would continue the Obama administration’s war on coal and relentless efforts to crush the oil and gas industry. Trump has said he will reduce regulations and allow the blossoming American energy renaissance to create millions of new high-paying jobs. Fourth, immigration. Clinton would continue and even expand President Obama’s lawless executive amnesty. Trump has promised that he would revoke those illegal executive orders. Fifth, national security. Clinton would continue the Obama administration’s willful blindness to radical Islamic terrorism. She would continue importing Middle Eastern refugees whom the FBI cannot vet to make sure they are not terrorists. Trump has promised to stop the deluge of unvetted refugees. Sixth, Internet freedom. Clinton supports Obama’s plan to hand over control of the Internet to an international community of stakeholders, including Russia, China, and Iran. Just this week, Trump came out strongly against that plan, and in support of free speech online. These are six vital issues where the candidates’ positions present a clear choice for the American people. If Clinton wins, we know — with 100% certainty — that she would deliver on her left-wing promises, with devastating results for our country. My conscience tells me I must do whatever I can to stop that. We also have seen, over the past few weeks and months, a Trump campaign focusing more and more on freedom — including emphasizing school choice and the power of economic growth to lift African-Americans and Hispanics to prosperity. Finally, after eight years of a lawless Obama administration, targeting and persecuting those disfavored by the administration, fidelity to the rule of law has never been more important. The Supreme Court will be critical in preserving the rule of law. And, if the next administration fails to honor the Constitution and Bill of Rights, then I hope that Republicans and Democrats will stand united in protecting our fundamental liberties. Our country is in crisis. Hillary Clinton is manifestly unfit to be president, and her policies would harm millions of Americans. And Donald Trump is the only thing standing in her way. A year ago, I pledged to endorse the Republican nominee, and I am honoring that commitment. And if you don’t want to see a Hillary Clinton presidency, I encourage you to vote for him. I’m not sure that I buy that Cruz’s endorsement is entirely voluntary, but the fact remains that he’s right. Since the time on the campaign trail, Trump’s campaign has become more serious and his policy outlines are more articulated. Still, it would have been nice if Trump had explained his ideas in the primary. Instead, what we got was slander and shady smears. 
Imagine that… at least 70% of the rioters in Charlotte, North Carolina were bused in. They had out of state IDs. Looks like it was well planned. I know here in Tulsa, hubby had to leave work early yesterday. We got word that Black Lives Matter was busing people into Tulsa as well. In our case, things stayed pretty peaceful fortunately. They weren’t so lucky in Charlotte. The head of the police union there came right out and said these were professional criminals that were brought in. This is the way the communists have organized these protests from the beginning. Wait for something to happen that causes outrage. Use the black community as useful tools for your agenda. Bus in outside radicals and then get your violence on. The people that are behind all this want race riots and chaos in our streets. Charlotte was a wild success for them… Tulsa, not so much.  From Louder with Crowder: Wait, the bulk of the people rioting in North Carolina are coming from out of state? Shut up. Generally speaking when there’s a riot like this, it’s all from people who are from the community, care about their community, and know what they’re even rioting about in the first place. No, no, that’s not sarcasm. Shut up. Take it away CNN…   “This is not Charlotte that’s out here. These are outside entities that are coming in and causing these problems. These are not protestors, these are criminals.” “We’ve got the instigators that are coming in from the outside. They were coming in on buses from out of state. If you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night. I can about say probably 70% of those had out-of-state IDs. They’re not coming from Charlotte.” I think the reason it did not work here in Tulsa is that the populace here is not nearly so sympathetic to Black Lives Matter. Also, the police officer who shot the black man has now been charged with Manslaughter. I still contend she had grounds to shoot the guy, but the charge probably diffused the situation somewhat. Charlotte has a large Black Lives Matter contingent and since there have been other events there, it was primed already for a riot. It’s not a conservative haven anymore and works well for their political agenda. These people don’t care about the facts or that black people are dying. They are looking for an excuse to riot and create chaos. That’s their goal… it’s part of wanting to burn all of America down. It’s what communists do – they want their revolution and race wars and they want them now. 
The FBI has just released their snazzy new Wanted Poster for the terrorist who is behind the Chelsea bombing in Manhattan. He is a natural born Afghani and considered armed and extremely dangerous. Ahmad Khan Rahami is 28 years-old and they have his face everywhere now. It has been reported that he has left notes and made calls that indicate there will be more bombings. I’m sure they are looking into his connections with the five bombs found in New Jersey this morning – one of which exploded when a robot approached it. I heard yesterday that they believe the same individual who made the bombs in Manhattan also did the ones in New Jersey. The apartment where this man lived in New Jersey has been raided by the FBI. Undercover agents and members of the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force were taking part in the raid above a chicken restaurant. The home was roughly one mile from the site where investigators found the five suspicious devices in a backpack, one of which exploded, outside a train station.  From the Independent Journal Review: Law enforcement released the name and photo Monday of 28-year-old Ahmad Khan Rahami, who is “being sought in connection” with this weekend’s New York City bombing, according to NYPD Spokesman Peter Donald:  The attack injured 29 people in New York City, although fortunately all of those wounded have already been released from hospitals.According to ABC News: Ahmad Khan Rahami, DOB 1/23/88, is wanted by the FBI in connection with at least one NYC-area bombing, the FBI says. The address of a home being searched by FBI agents in Elizabeth, New Jersey is linked to a person with a similar name. The wanted poster is below:  Federal authorities conducted a traffic stop of a “vehicle of interest” in the Chelsea bombing Sunday night in Brooklyn. A law enforcement source told Fox News that a “number of individuals” who are possibly connected to the explosion were taken into custody. It’s laughable that de Blasio and others are now calling it terrorism, but say there is no connection to international terrorists. These guys are liars and deeply stupid. Rahami is the man captured on surveillance footage planting the bombs. There is other physical evidence linking Rahami to the devices that have gone off or been found in New York and New Jersey. The pipe bombs were filled with shrapnel and were meant to create many casualties. We are very lucky no one has died yet. There is now a search on for this guy nationwide and the clock is ticking. 
A new investigation has determined that Donald Trump’s charitable foundation funneled other people’s money into settling his lawsuits, which violates laws preventing charitable organizations from accepting donors funds and benefitting those who run the foundations. With a stroke of the pen Trump pilfered the average wage of five working Americans to payoff his business fines: Donald Trump spent more than a quarter-million dollars from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits that involved the billionaire’s for-profit businesses, according to interviews and a review of legal documents. Those cases, which together used $258,000 from Trump’s charity, were among four newly documented expenditures in which Trump may have violated laws against “self-dealing” — which prohibit nonprofit leaders from using charity money to benefit themselves or their businesses. The Washington Post‘s David Farenthold has doggedly chased down every lead from the Donald J. Trump Foundation and is in the process of singlehandedly using a dog-eared notebook (they’ve shown photos of it) to literally do what the entire news media is afraid of doing: a complete fact check of Donald Trump’s dubious history of illegal self-dealing and political corruption. It was Farenthold’s investigation which has now caused every major newspaper in Florida to call for a federal investigation into the Trump University pay-for-play scandal where the very same foundation Trump robbed to payoff lawsuits also made an illegal campaign contribution to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. Now his reporting shows that he used the same foundation to settle a $120,000 fine for Mar-a-lago, Trump’s glitzy party palace in Palm Beach and the nation’s largest private home. Trump was supposed to donate money to a veteran’s foundation, instead he simply took it from others who donated to the foundation instead. Ironically, it was all because of the size of a flagpole: In one case, from 2007, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club faced $120,000 in unpaid fines from the town of Palm Beach, Fla., resulting from a dispute over the size of a flagpole. In a settlement, Palm Beach agreed to waive those fines — if Trump’s club made a $100,000 donation to a specific charity for veterans. Instead, Trump sent a check from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity funded almost entirely by other people’s money, according to tax records. This wasn’t just charity for the wealthy; it was a direct subsidy to one of the Trump Organization’s most prized businesses. But it wouldn’t be the only six figure heist engineered by Donald Trump with little more than the stroke of a pen. When you watch Donald Trump pitch his golf course in Scotland on a campaign trip, just remember that the mismanagement of his expensive golf courses frequently land the Republican nominee in court. WaPo reports that: One of Trump’s golf courses in New York agreed to settle a lawsuit by making a donation to the plaintiff’s chosen charity. A $158,000 donation was made by the Trump Foundation, according to tax records. On top of that, Trump also used his charitable foundation’s funds to buy a 6-foot tall oil canvas painting of himself and a $12,000 Tim Tebow football helmet. The latest find by Farenthold uncovered that he spent another $10,000 on second portrait of himself as well as $5000 for advertisements for his chain of hotels. We hear that the latest of Trump’s charitable oil-on-canvas selfies is smaller. The New York Attorney General has already opened an investigation into the Donald J. Trump Foundation for its illegal transaction with Florida’s Attorney General, and these new revelations appear to fit right in with the pattern of the Republican’s nominee for President which we know all too well by now. Donald Trump is all too happy to lie or cheat or steal, as long as he can get away with it. Here’s the check proving that Trump stole from his donors to pay for Mar-a-lago’s debts: 
Police have found some very disturbing leads in the Chelsea bombing this last Saturday. The greatest suspicion is Muslim extremists who are claiming credit for the terror that injured dozens. The bomb in Chelsea injured 29 people, all discharged from the hospital. Another pressure-cooker bomb was found stashed in a Dumpster four blocks away.   Police are investigating just WHAT happened. While the leads come in, there are three in particular that have grabbed the attention of the press: Lead #1 – A hand-written letter, a portion of which was in Arabic, was found inside the plastic bag that also held the second device. Lead #2 – A 911 unidentified male caller warned of further explosions and the call went like this: “I’m looking at the explosion down the block. There will be more.” Lead #3 – A Tumblr page called ‘I’m the NY Bomber’ that claims to be the “manifesto” of the bomber responsible for the explosion that rocked New York City Saturday night. HERE. Manufacturing Test Explosives Hi. You probably have all seen the news by now, the explosives detonated in New York City, that was me. Those were just some tests, I know where I have made errors and I will not make the same mistake next time. I did it because I cannot stand society. I cannot live in a world where homosexuals like myself as well as the rest of the LGBTQ+ community are looked down upon by society. It is 2016 and we are still being viewed as mentally ill, sinners, attention seekers, and just plain weirdos in general. I am not going to stand by while under classed and underprivileged people are oppressed. I am not going to stand by while there is inequality in my country such as the racism being seen in white police officers all over the country. I am not going to live in a country where it is OK to have a misogynist, xenophobic, racist Islamophobic, republican candidate running for President of The United States! That’s implying that republicans in general should even be taken seriously as they are all cisgendered privileged white people. This is not the end, this is just the beginning. I will be remembered. I will make a difference. I will eliminate my targets before it is too late. Someone is lying and it’s just sick that anyone would want to claim this, especially one who didn’t even do it. Trying to benefit off of other’s terror is as base as you can go next to being the perpetrator.   
During a Fox and Friends interview Monday morning to talk about the NYC bombings, Donald Trump came dangerously close to suggesting unheard of levels of censorship. Trump asserted that the the biggest obstacle towards stopping terrorism at home is the first amendment and the lax attitude surrounding freedom of the press. Referring to jihadi propaganda, the Donald said: “They’re all talking about it so wonderfully because, you know, it’s called “freedom of the press,” where you buy magazines and they tell you how to make these same bombs that I saw. They tell you how to make bombs. We should arrest the people that do that because they’re participating in crime. Instead they say “oh no you can’t do anything, that’s freedom of expression.” Of course, this is wild conjecture. There is no way Donald Trump has absolutely any idea why the New York bomber decided to build these bombs, the information for which is easily found in a cursory Google search, which has nothing to do with how that possibly relates to the print news media’s freedom of expression, which he’s criticized on numerous occasions. The type of publications that would even contain this kind of information – we’re assuming he’s referring to the Daeshi magazine, Dabiq –  are diligently hunted down and taken off the website by counterterror forces. But the most terrifying aspect of this line of thinking, is how casually it could use the “boogeyman of terrorism” to make freedom of speech disposable, setting a dangerous precedent that could be expanded to censor any kind of dissenting opinion. Trump, has long demonstrated his disdain for the press, and has a chilling history that suggests he would be open to embracing unconstitutional censorship. Trump has praised the leadership of Russia, admiring its “strength” despite its history of censorship and human rights abuses including state control of the media and regular murder of dissident journalists. Back in August, he took to Twitter and railed against “the corrupt media” and freedom of the press for having the audacity to look into his personal life and to dig up the skeletons in his closet. Although Trump has never actually revealed what he would do to address this grievance with the press, his comments underscore a grim future ahead for America if he is elected. Trump has taken every opportunity to criticize and attempt to discredit anyone that disagrees with him in any way, leaving behind a trail of journalists and citizens fed up with appalling lack of regard to the First Amendment and the founding principles of our nation. Here’s the full interview with Fox & Friends: 
Democratic National Committee interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile appeared on MSNBC’s “AM Joy” on Sunday and discussed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s collapse on Sept. 11. What was intended to be a compliment turned out to be a major admission about the severity of Clinton’s health that day. “Although she had to be lifted into that van, you know what? She got up, like most of us, she got up and she kept fighting, so that’s the Hillary Clinton that I hope people get to know,” Brazile said, Breitbart reported. This is the first time someone from Team Clinton has admitted that the former secretary of state had to be lifted into the van, and that’s big news because it means Clinton was not in control of her body. Talk about bad news getting worse. Brazile thought she was giving Clinton a compliment, but she slipped up and essentially made things worse for Clinton by admitting the former first lady had to be lifted into the van. The question that will be on the minds of many people is exactly when Hillary got up on her own and what was needed for her to do so. While Clinton has admitted to being diagnosed with pneumonia, that doesn’t get rid of her other chronic condition — lying to the public. She said she didn’t tell the public about her diagnosis because she didn’t think it was a big deal, but if she pays just a little bit of attention to the news, she would have known the her health is a huge concern — one she should not be ignoring. Clinton’s episode on Sept. 11 was serious, and many people across the globe saw it — including world leaders who could view her condition — whatever it is — as a weakness, and attempt to take advantage of it. Share this story on Twitter and Facebook and let us know what you think about Donna Brazile’s statement that Clinton had to befitted into the van. Do you think Hillary is fooling anyone about her health? Scroll down to comment below!
America continues to be rocked by racial unrest and division, as the shooting of a black man in Charlotte, North Carolina sends folks into a frenzy of rioting and violence. Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by police yesterday, an incident about which race hustlers wasted no time in jumping to conclusions — and pushing narratives — particularly after the man’s daughter posted a video ranting that her father was disabled and unarmed. Police Chief Kerr Putney and his officers have a bit of a different take on the situation, however. They’ve just revealed the man was armed. Furthermore, Chief Putney says police gave him several warnings to drop the gun, which he refused to do. According to TheBlaze, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said during a news conference Wednesday morning that officers were searching for a suspect Tuesday when they saw 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott exit a vehicle with a handgun. He says the officers told him to drop the gun and that he got out of the vehicle a second time still carrying the gun. He says the man was shot because he posed a threat. Charlotte Police Chief: Officers gave loud, clear commands before shooting https://t.co/jZPnOfSwvC #KeithLamontScott https://t.co/UpzQj5qZwo — CNN (@CNN) September 21, 2016  “It’s time to change the narrative, because I can tell you from the facts that the story’s a little bit different as to how it’s been portrayed so far, especially through social media,” he said. His comments were an apparent reference to a profanity-laced, hourlong video that a woman claiming to be Scott’s daughter posted to Facebook soon after the shooting, saying that her father had an unspecified disability and was unarmed. In it, she appears to be at the shooting scene, which is surrounded by yellow police tape, as she yells at officers. The woman did not respond to Facebook messages, and her claims could not immediately be verified by The Associated Press. It also was not clear if she witnessed the shooting. As of now, the facts surrounding this case are still coming in, so it’s difficult to make a final judgment on the whole situation. If Scott was indeed armed and refused to comply with police officers, then those on the scene had no choice but to use force to neutralize the threat posed by the suspect. What’s unfortunate is that so many folks in Charlotte — and across the nation — have jumped to conclusions, buying into the narrative that police officers are somehow a corrupt institution looking for new and creative ways to exterminate blacks. Our nation is in desperate need of healing along racial lines, but this will never happen as long as folks believe a false narrative they’re being spoon fed by liberals who want nothing more than to keep minorities enslaved to the Democratic Party.

You’ve probably seen the bumper stickers that say, “Don’t like abortion? Don’t have one!” Perhaps during the slavery debate in our country, a similar bumper sticker could have read, “Don’t like slavery? Don’t own one!” Proponents argue that abortion doesn’t affect most people, so people shouldn’t care. It’s between a woman and her doctor. They say that pro-lifers shouldn’t be able to force their worldview down everyone else’s throats. They shouldn’t be able – through legislation – to “force” childbirth on women who don’t want to have babies. So, since the issue isn’t affecting anyone, except the mother – and the baby who doesn’t get a say, but that’s beside the point – it should be left solely up to the woman and her right to do with her body what she wants. (Even though the baby isn’t her body.) You could say the same thing about slavery. It didn’t affect anyone except the slave owner – and the slave, but they didn’t view slaves as people then (kind of like how unborn babies aren’t people either) – so, if you didn’t like slavery, good for you. Don’t own any. And don’t force your worldview down everyone else’s throats. Well, here’s one activist and head of an abortion rights group who’s comparing abortion to slavery. Except, she’s arguing that not allowing federal funding for abortion is tantamount to slavery. And allowing federal funding for abortion would be “setting women free.” Here’s CNS News: Kierra Johnson, executive director of URGE: Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity, testified Friday before the House Judiciary Committee examining the Hyde Amendment, which forbids the use of federal funds for abortion except in cases of rape and incest, and compared the amendment to slavery, saying that repealing the Hyde Amendment is about “setting us (women) free.” Johnson responded to a question on the impact of the Hyde amendment on low-income women, referencing an earlier comment from Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) in which he compared the Supreme Court’s Dred Scott decision to abortion, saying, “It’s interesting that we’re bringing up slavery in this space. When you own somebody’s decision-making, you own them.” “The Hyde amendment is about increasing coverage of insurance,” she argued. “It is about returning decision-making back to women. It’s about setting us free. “When you get to decide for them whether or not their body has value, you own them whether you decide they’re valuable as black or not, you actually don’t get to make that decision,” Johnson emphasized. “We are valuable, and women are valuable. The Hyde amendment simply says set us free,” she said. “We are not simple-minded. We are not being duped. Women are choosing to be pregnant and have children. The majority of women who have abortions are parents. They care, they care about their families.” “We should repeal the Hyde Amendment,” she concluded. There should be no federal funding for abortion, period, regardless of how the baby was conceived. In the vast majority of cases, people want abortion for convenience. They want sex without consequences. Even in the cases of rape and incest – while those instances are tragic – you don’t punish the baby. It wasn’t the baby’s fault. The baby merely becomes an innocent bystander. Instead of punishing the baby, the rapist should be the one to be aborted.

Last Saturday, thousands of people were about to participate in a charity 5K race to benefit Marines and sailors in New Jersey when they discovered a bomb had been planted in an area where the crowd would be standing. Later that evening, nine people were stabbed at a shopping mall in Minnesota in a horrific act of violence by a man making references to ‘Allah’.   Obama, the President of the United States, MUST have heard about the New Jersey and New York bombings earlier Saturday before giving his speech at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Dinner. Minnesota stabbings had just barely happened. Dozens were injured, so Obama MUST have been told, right? Then about 8:40 PM, a dumpster exploded outside of the Associated Blind Housing facility in New York City. There we NO sensitivities as Obama began his speech. 2 minutes into his speech he joked about ‘ISIL’ which was terrible, horrible and very tacky timing. “I don’t know about you guys, but I am so relieved that the whole birther thing is over,” Obama said. “I mean, ISIL, North Korea, poverty, climate change, none of those things weighed on my mind like the validity of my birth certificate.” At one point in the speech, he delivered an impassioned plea to the black community to stop Donald Trump, saying he would consider it a “personal insult” to his legacy if black voters didn’t turn out for Hillary Clinton. Looks like the Democrats are struggling and rightly so as the NY Post just reported on a new poll that shows Trump dramatically increasing with black voters. Trump just saw a 16.5 percentage-point increase in backing from African-American voters in a Los Angeles Times/University of Southern California tracking poll, up from 3.1 percent on Sept. 10 to 19.6 percent through Friday.   
Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani decided to weigh in on future President Hillary Clintonâs ability to perform as President in a worse way than Trumpâs âstaminaâ remarks at the first presidential debate. According to Giuliani, the fact that Clinton is strong enough and loves her husband enough to make things work after he was unfaithful to her is actually a sign of weakness that disqualifies her from being President just as much as That One Time She Coughed and her almost superhuman ability to work hardÂ and power through pneumonia for days before she finally collapses from the unnatural amount of strain she put on her body. âThe president of the United States, her husband, disgraced this country with what he did in the Oval Office and she didnât just stand by him, she attacked Monica Lewinsky,â Giuliani said following Mondayâs debate. âAnd after being married to Bill Clinton for 20 years, if you didnât know the moment Monica Lewinsky said that Bill Clinton violated her that she was telling the truth, then youâre too stupid to be president.â Bill Clinton didnât actually âviolateâ anybody. He fooled around with a woman, who was an adult and consented to everything they did, behind his wifeâs back. While she certainly had the right to be angry, and Americans absolutely have the right to criticize him (he was wrong, but it didnât affect his ability to run the country), to say that she is a weak person for staying with him is absolute bullsh*t. Clintonâs strength is in her ability to forgive, to think of the bigger picture, to make her marriage work in spite of a very, very public affair. Of course, this is the sort of thinking that can be expected from a guy who was Mayor when the planes hit the twin towers on September 11, 2001, yet recently completely forgot about those attacks while he was criticizing President Obama, who paraded his mistress around for all to see, and who told the media he was divorcing his wife before he informedÂ her or theirÂ children. âUnder those eight years, before Obama came along, we didnât have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack inside the United States,â GiulianiÂ said in a speech in youngstown, Ohio earlier lastÂ month.Â âThey all started when Clinton and Obama got into office.â Watch it below: https://twitter.com/asvokos/status/780619672760623104/video/1 
Former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan once said “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.” To which the head of the Commission on Presidential Debates has officially responded: “Says who?” In a stunning interview with CNN’s Reliable Sources, Janet Brown gave a baffling explanation for why she believes fact checking should be taken off the table at presidential debates. “I think personally if you start getting into fact checking, I’m not sure. What is a big fact? What is a little fact? And if you and I have different sources of information does your source about the unemployment rate agree with my source? I don’t think it’s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica.” Head of Commission on Presidential Debates doesn’t want moderators correcting lies because “what is a big fact, what is a little fact?” #cnn pic.twitter.com/krm5FeV9aW — John Aravosis (@aravosis) September 25, 2016  The statement was exactly what the Trump campaign had been demanding for weeks and was ecstatic to hear. Going into Monday’s crucial first presidential debate, the Republican candidate understood that the most dangerous hurdle he had to get around was if the moderator called him on his lies. Trump, who has dismissed preparing for the debate out of hand, lies a lot. That’s his strength. He needs it to win. Politico recently analyzed Trump’s last five days on the campaign trail and found that Donald Trump lies at a rate of once every 3 minutes and 15 seconds. Trump’s misrepresentations range from false pronouncements (he again wrongly said he opposed the war in Iraq before it began) to the petty (he insisted Clinton had copied him by holding rallies with her plane in the background and insinuated she was “sleeping” when she held no public events). He contradicted his own policy on providing health care to the poor, overstated the ad-spending discrepancy between his campaign and Clinton’s and exaggerated the size of his primary victories and polling leads. (For what it’s worth, they also fact-checked Clinton and found that while she, like any politician, does fudge the truth occasionally, Trump’s lying “so greatly exceed[s] Clinton’s as to make the comparison almost ludicrous.” Ouch.) And while Debate Commissioner Brown used an intentionally vague example (“unemployment rate”), there is no indication that Trump will reserve lies to things so nuanced. One example that might come up: Donald Trump continues to insist that the crime rate in America is going through the roof. This is a blatant lie that is exposed by just quick glance at the FBI’s crime statistics. The debate moderator doesn’t need to serve as the “Encyclopedia Britannica,” he or she just needs to know the basic facts. Big and small. And not let Trump get away with misleading the American people who are tuning in. Journalists, whose job it is to deal in facts, are furious with this caving to Trump. If reporters aren't supposed to factcheck at debates, why exactly are reporters moderators to begin with? Why not just have an actor do it? — Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) September 25, 2016  Debate Commission director seems to think there are no facts, just different sources to support any claim. That helps elect President Trump. https://t.co/lPkCQi2KL4 — Mr Media Training (@MrMediaTraining) September 25, 2016  What is the point of a debate moderator other than fact checking? Why is this even a discussion? — Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) September 25, 2016  Meanwhile, Trump’s supporters are actively celebrating. They, just like their candidate, understand that the only path to victory for Trump is if he can get Americans to believe his lies. @AJDelgado13 Here is a crazy idea…..let the voters at home fact check. Let social media fact check. Candy taught us this. — Judson McCulloch (@JudsonMcCulloch) September 25, 2016  Hint: If you find yourself in a political party that’s major talking point leading up to a debate is that your candidate should be allowed to lie on stage, you might want to consider finding a new political party.

An English man, Liam Edwards, has been arrested and now awaits trial because he placed some anti-halal stickers on meat products at a local grocery store in his hometown of Salford. Halal refers to the method in which Muslims prepare meat before and after slaughter. Edwards rightfully opposes halal because it hosts ties to not only terrorism, but animal cruelty as well. The stickers read, “Beware! Halal is barbaric and funds terrorism #BanHalal”:  Just a month ago, for instance, an undercover video shot by an animal charity organization showed Muslims at a North Yorkshire slaughterhouse “sawing at the animals’ necks with seemingly blunt knives, stamping on the sheep and kicking them in the head as they attempted to get them onto the conveyor belt.” Furthermore, according to an Australian anti-Islamic activist known only as Ms. Smith, the money procured from halal slaughterhouses tends to be used to fund extremism. Added to this is the fact that those brands who choose to purchase halal-certified meat must pay an Islamic religious tax. None of these facts apparently matter to the prosecuting attorney in Liam’s case, Holly Holden, who opined in court that “the point about animal slaughter can be expressed in a different way without suggesting halal and terrorism is linked.” As a result, Liam now faces charges of “racially or religiously aggravated criminal damage” and must go to trial on July 23 (H/T Breitbart). I guess offending Muslims with facts is not acceptable in England. It’s a shame Liam doesn’t live in the United States, where the First Amendment protects every citizen’s right to speak (or write) the truth, regardless of whom that truth offends. Please share this post on Facebook if you too find animal cruelty and terrorism to be far more offensive than fact-based anti-halal stickers. Via Conservative Tribune 
Another day in “Obama’s America”… another RIOT. This kind of crap is becoming our norm, and it’s not right. This time…Police shoot ARMED man who is deemed a threat by his actions, and the BlackLivesMatter crowd goes WILD! …but I mean really wild. Like, savage. They have entered their rioting mode again. His parents are telling everyone it wasn’t a weapon in his hand, it was a book. A book ladies and gentlemen. What’s that smell? Oh…nasty. It’s bullcrap. SO…there is a fatal police shooting and now, the Police are under full attack, reporters are getting rocks thrown at their head, innocent bystanders’ are getting their vehicles bashed up and set on fire….and yes, stores are being looted. Free ipads and laptops for EVERYONE! Because they are grieving that someone has died, the country is against them and stealing stuff they wanted but never could get…makes it all better right? Imbeciles. This is no stand they are taking at all. No..this? This is what ‘stupid’ looks like when it takes human form. Now, word has come through that a female trucker has fallen victim to the monster maniacs. Her truck was looted, and the cargo left was set on fire. However, that’s not all… She made a desperate call to Police, but by the time they were able to arrive, the damage had been done. For all she knew when she called her life was in danger, and that is exactly the kind of fear she was faced with. It ticks me off. Who do they think they are, right? …but worse, where the HELL is Obama?   I’ll tell you where… He’s laughing. At you, at me, and at all the stupid liberals who think he cares about hope and change. The only kind of hope he cares about is the kind he can crush. As far as change? He’s nailed that one real good. Criminals are victims, and Police Officers are now criminals. Man…Obama’s America SUCKS.

For the past week rioters have been wrecking havok all across Charlotte. The riots are in response to the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, which has been cited as just the latest example of an unarmed black man killed by racist police brutality. Scott’s wife, who filmed the shooting, told police that he wasn’t armed and was only carrying a book. As usual, the shooting happened under circumstances much more murky than those citing this as an unjustified act of police violence would like to admit. There was in fact a gun recovered at the scene, and there was a holster on Scott’s leg spotted in the police dash-cam footage. Those citing this as yet another “proof” that police are racist should know that the officer who shot Scott was black himself, so race was not a motivating factor in the shooting. As it turns out, Scott has a history of violence, and there’s no reason to think he wouldn’t have used his firearm if he had the chance. As Bearing Arms reported: Rakeyia Scott’s cry to CMPD officers that her husband, Keith Lamont Scott, did not own a gun—even as he brandished a gun in front of them—now appears to be a calculated lie, according to Rakeyia Scott. On Oct. 5, a Gaston County District Court judge granted his wife a temporary restraining order. The court order told Scott not to go near his wife, three of their children and the children’s schools. He was not allowed near their Gastonia apartment they’d called home since April 2014, according to court documents. He was told to turn over a black 9mm handgun he owned illegally. Eleven days later, Rakeyia Scott voluntarily dismissed the order against her husband, writing, “He is no longer a threat to me and my family.” But three days before she got the order, Keith Scott had kicked her, punched their 8-year-old in the head three times and threatened to kill her with the gun, she had written. “He said he is a ‘killer’ and we should know that,” she wrote. She said the man she’d been married to since she was 18 did not have a gun permit and was a felon, having been incarcerated from April 2004 to April 2011. She checked a box saying her husband had threatened her with the gun before. The Scott family is now trying to claim that the head injuries suffered by Scott left him a changed man, and yet, he was still an armed felon, brandishing a gun, if not threatening with her at this time. Yeah – OK. Scott’s wife told officers he didn’t own a firearm during the altercation, which was clearly a lie, and one that could’ve gotten them killed. While rioters destroy Charlotte, they’re doing so over a man who could’ve killed those officers, and had a wife that he himself once threatened would’ve been an accomplice to their murders. 
In an interview with Rolling Stone, rock legend and American icon Bruce Springsteen ripped Republican nominee Donald Trump for undermining the integrity of our democracy and for unleashing the undercurrents of white supremacy into mainstream American politics. When asked what his thoughts on the Trump phenomenon were, he gave this nuanced and eloquent response: Well, you know, the republic is under siege by a moron, basically. The whole thing is tragic. Without overstating it, it’s a tragedy for our democracy. When you start talking about elections being rigged, you’re pushing people beyond democratic governance. And it’s a very, very dangerous thing to do. Once you let those genies out of the bottle, they don’t go back in so easy, if they go back in at all. The ideas he’s moving to the mainstream are all very dangerous ideas – white nationalism and the alt-right movement. The outrageous things that he’s done – not immediately disavowing David Duke? These are things that are obviously beyond the pale for any previous political candidate. It would sink your candidacy immediately. I believe that there’s a price being paid for not addressing the real cost of the deindustrialization and globalization that has occurred in the United States for the past 35, 40 years and how it’s deeply affected people’s lives and deeply hurt people to where they want someone who says they have a solution. And Trump’s thing is simple answers to very complex problems. Fallacious answers to very complex problems. And that can be very appealing. It is indeed a tragedy for our democracy. The most important part of democratic governance is ensuring the public believes that our politicians are held in check by the will of the people – and the behavior of the Republican Party over the past eight years has been to erode that confidence in our electoral system through their efforts gain unfair advantage by repressing the votes of minorities and gerrymandering districts to ensure their political security. At the same time, their single-minded devotion to increasing the political power of the monied elites and funneling the wealth of the American people to the top 1% has greatly exacerbated the costs of deindustrialization/globalization, while studiously denying the existence of those costs in the first place. Donald Trump is the epitome of that excess, the wealthy man who has spent his entire life exploiting and extorting his way to wealth who has now turned to cheap ethnonationalist scapegoating as a way of shifting the blame for the economic frustrations of the working class off of predatory capitalists like himself and onto minority groups. “The Boss” also gave a resounding endorsement of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, saying that he thinks she would be a “a very, very good president.” Springsteen’s words remind us all of what’s at stake in this election, and why it’s so critical that we defeat Donald Trump at the ballot box this November.
Bloomberg News reports that the Mexican peso grew significantly stronger after Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s powerful performance in tonight’s key first presidential debate, after confidently besting Republican Donald Trump. The “invisible hand” of the market is predicting a Hillary Clinton win after tonight’s debate, and that she’s the only one of the two candidates whose election would keep more jobs in the USA too: The Mexican peso rebounded from a record low, a sign investors may perceive Hillary Clinton outperformed Donald Trump in the first U.S. presidential debate. The currency rose 2 percent to 19.4879 per dollar as of 1:20 p.m. in Tokyo, the biggest gain across more than 140 currencies worldwide, after the debate concluded. Around the world, currency traders, the kind-of-by-the-numbers, bottom line capitalists who Republicans profess to believe in the most, were unequivocal. They awarded victory in the first 2016 Presidential debate to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by buying up Mexican pesos believing them to be more valuable with a stable diplomatic situation, and by the numbers traders weighed in: “I shall not speculate on whether Clinton won or was Trumped,” wrote Jeffrey Halley wrote market strategist at Oanda Corporation in Singapore, “But clearly, the highest [correlated] currency to a Trump victory thinks she did!” On a practical level, a stronger Peso also means that labor in Mexico will get more expensive for American companies as the exchange rate moves when Hillary does better in polling. Professional currency traders have been betting against the Mexican currency for months to insure themselves against an improbable Republican victory in November, which would set forth a catastrophe if NAFTA is unilaterally cancelled, costing millions of Americans their jobs to appease Trump’s delirious policy dreams. Ironically, this means that a Trump victory would make outsourcing far more attractive since people would depress the value of Mexican pesos, making the cost of hiring even cheaper than today. This also means that a Hillary Clinton victory in November will make Mexico’s currency stronger, which will in turn make it more attractive to our corporations to hire American workers or slow down the rate of outsourcing because of higher labor costs south of the border with a stronger Peso. Voting for Hillary Clinton is now economically certain to be better than voting for her lying Republican opponent, because his racism would literally be self-defeating, and the “invisible hand of the market” would be best held by a Democrat’s steady hand in the Oval Office come January. 
Now we find out that not only is Ahmad Rahami a terrorist and a murderer, he’s an entitled whiner. Ahmad Rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture. Ironically, he was arrested for planting bombs around the Tri-state area… you know, his culture.   In the lawsuit, the family complained that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that they had owned since 2002. The family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit, filed in the federal court in Newark, says that the family are from Afghanistan and are all Muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002.   From April 2009 for two years they allege that they were unfairly targeted for staying open past 10pm despite being permitted to do so. The lawsuit says that the police had a ‘reckless disregard and deliberate indifference for plaintiff’s constitutional rights of liberty, due process and equal protection’. The Elizabeth police department allegedly ’embarked on a course to harass, humiliate, retaliate against and force their business to close at 10pm’. The lawsuit claims that the officers told them there was ‘too much crime around here’ and that the area around the restaurant was ‘known for criminal activity’. The irony of it all is that just 5 years later, Ahmad was arrested for the very same thing he was fighting. Hmmm, it’s not like a person goes from selling fried chicken to building bombs in just 5 years, right? I’m wondering if anyone else can believe that Ahmad went off the reservation because he felt like he was being targeted for being a Muslim or if it’s more believable that Ahmad is a Muslim who happens to be an extremist and he’s been planning this for some time.   
Famed economist and former labor secretary Robert Reich posted an interaction he recently had with a Trump supporter that demonstrates just how deeply this ridiculous misconception that Donald Trump is a “good businessman” has sunk into the public consciousness.  The idea that we need a “successful businessman” as a President at all is very concerning. Businessmen only care about one thing – their profits, and increasing those profits. A nation-state is not a business, nor should it be run like one. The leader of a nation-state must care for the well-being of his people and balancing complex international relationships with other nation-states, concerns that don’t have anything to do with the single-minded obsession with profit. And of course, Trump is not a good businessman. He started out with a “small loan” of just a million dollars after being handed all the opportunities a straight white male needs to make it in America. He then lied, cheated and extorted his way to the top, and still managed to rack up four bankruptcies and over 3500 lawsuits. He is nothing but a con-man, and he will run our country into the ground just like he’s done his businesses.
The University of North Dakota is investigating a racist Snapchat post depicting three white students locking out a black student from her own dorm room, according to the Grand Forks Herald. Etonde Maloke, a friend of the victim, shared in a Facebook post on Tuesday a picture of three white students laughing together in a dorm room. The photo features the caption, “Locked the black bitch out.” The white students had actually posted the offensive photo on the black student’s Snapchat account. “My friend left her phone in her room and the three kids pictured below took her phone and took the snapchat pictured below,” Maloke explained. “They captioned it ‘locked the black bitch out’. My friend was not aware that they had done this and didn’t even realize they had put this on her snapchat story until another friend of ours pointed it out.” “We all know Racism is alive and well (whether you like to admit it not),” she wrote. “When said acts of racism happen at your school, it is infuriating and heart breaking.” I’m so livid!! We all know Racism is alive and well (whether you like to admit it not). When said acts of racism happen… Posted by Etonde Maloke on Tuesday, September 20, 2016 The University of North Dakota posted a statement to Twitter, saying it was “in the process of gathering information.” “What is portrayed is not part of the community values that we expound,” the statement said. “We take seriously issues related to respect for all.” pic.twitter.com/XkXpL0tYEa — Univ of North Dakota (@myUND) September 21, 2016       
President Obama is now in the record books. He just reached a record-settingÂ 78 months of job growth. Since 2010, businesses have added more than 15.1 million jobs. Thatâs longer than any president ever has before. This news comes after the August jobs report was just released, showing an additional 151,000 added in that month alone. Jason Furman, the Chairman of the Council Economic Advisers, added: this is while âthe unemployment rate and labor force participation rate have both held steady.â Â   He further stated: âSo far in 2016, job growth has averaged a solid 182,000 jobs a month, well above the pace of about 80,000 jobs a month needed to maintain a low and stable unemployment rate, and hourly earnings for private-sector workers have increased at an annual rate of 2.8 percent, much faster than the pace of inflation.â We must remind you, this isnât partisan analysis. This is undisputed data. In the past, the GOP used to complain about the low unemployment (this was their primary talking point) but since Obama took office, and with those numbers showing only positive growth, they have instead switched their argument to the economyâs participation rate. Except â thereâs only one problem with that. The participation rate is largely in decline due to the baby boom generation retiring. In fact, itâs been in decline for quite some time, spanning back even before George W. Bushâs presidency. The truth is, the economy hasnât been this good in some time. Itâs nearly 15 percent bigger, actually, than it was in 2008. Â Itâs time to start giving President Obama credit where credit is due. Republicans may not like it, but the fact remains, Obama just made history. Featured Image Getty Images.
Every Presidential nominee since 1976 has released their tax returns except for Republicans Donald Trump and Gerald Ford. Debate moderator Lester Holt put Trump on the spot about releasing his returns, and he filibustered, hemmed and hawed intensely, used the old “I’m waiting for an audit to finish” excuse, and then actually dropped a shocking revelation – saying he’s been under audit for 15 years now! – before unleashing a horde of “4 Pinocchio” level lies. The IRS has confirmed time and time again that there is nothing preventing Trump from releasing his returns, and noting that it is very unusual to be under audit for so long, implying that there’s something foul at play. But this hasn’t been just a dodgy situation in this campaign; Trump promised to release his returns if President Obama released his birth certificate. We all know how that turned out: In 2011, when Trump was spearheading the movement questioning whether President Obama was born in the United States, Trump told ABC News that he would release his tax returns if Obama released his long-form birth certificate. “I’d love to give my tax returns,” he said. But once Obama released his birth certificate, Trump hedged. “At the appropriate time I’m going to do it,” he said. The appropriate time never came. It turns out that Trump has been under audit for 15 years! It also turns out that the repeated questions about Trump’s missing tax returns did yield one revelation from the Republican nominee – he tacitly admitted he doesn’t pay income tax, and he thinks that’s great because it makes him “smart” and not greedy. In the end, Hillary Clinton scored her very best zinger of the night after Trump looked like a one armed wall-paper hanger with crabs, trying to cover up a very large wall, with nothing more than shameful lies and promises, and certainly none of his tax papers which the American people deserve to see before voting for this country’s President. Hillary Clinton has already released over 30 years of taxes, as has her husband former President Bill Clinton has too. Trump: We don't have the money for bridges. Hillary: Maybe because you're not paying income taxes! #debatenight #debates — Grant Stern (@grantstern) September 27, 2016  Mainstream news took note of the exchange too. Hillary said that Trump must have something to hide. Trump didn’t respond. Clinton: No reason to believe Trump will ever release tax returns, he must be hiding something #debates pic.twitter.com/IRDbW4UbaS — CNBC (@CNBC) September 27, 2016 
When word got out the Westboro Baptist Church was going to picket a Marine's funeral, a group of veterans knew exactly what they had to do (video below). Marine Cpl. Richard Bennet died at the age of 25 in a helicopter crash in Iraq. The Westboro Baptist Church reportedly chose to protest at his funeral because it believes God kills members of the military due to America's acceptance of homosexuality, reports Little Things. Bennet's family was devastated when it heard the group would be picketing his funeral, but fortunately, it had some good people on its side. Biker group The Patriots Guard  announced it would be attending the funeral to keep the Westboro Baptist Church out and give the family the peace it deserved. "No family should have to face this type of hatred on the day that they’re putting their loved ones to rest," said Ken Van, pastor and member of The Patriots Guard. "Bennet died defending our sacred freedoms, and he even died to give the fringe members of the Westboro Baptist Church the right to picket his own funeral, but just because they have the right to speak doesn’t mean we have to listen." The Patriots Guard showed up at Bennet's funeral and formed a human fence around the premises, with each member holding an American flag. They used their motorcycles' engines to drown out the sounds of the Westboro Baptist Church's chants. Watch a video of The Patriots Guard protecting Bennet's funeral below.

This last Friday five people were shot and killed by a mass murdered at the Cascade Mall in Burlington, Washington which is located just north of Seattle. Arcan Cetin whose a Turkish born national was arrested shortly after the attack for the tragedy that took five lives. Unlike what the mainstream liberal media has reported he is not a Hispanic man. The police have said that the description of the assailant was based on eye witness reports. Social media indicates otherwise as seen below, Arcan Cetin himself, people #CascadeMallShooting pic.twitter.com/aIb2RElVPP — The Swog Blog (@hunterswogg) September 25, 2016  News has also come to light that he was a supporter of the terrorist group ISIS and that he had praised its leader Baghdadi. Who is on the Federal Bureau of Investigations watch list and is a notorious radical Islamic terrorist.  The Heavy had reported information they attained from the suspects tumblr page in which he spoke of Allah and users referred to Muslim paradise. Look below,  The suspect is being held without bail on five counts of murder. He has a very long criminal history which also includes restraining orders as well as domestic violence charges against him. Because of his prior run ins with the law he was required to take mental health and anger management courses which he complied with. But clearly they did not work what so ever otherwise five innocent people would still be alive today. By all appearances this attack seems to be another terrorist attack but the mainstream media is ignoring it. However, the police are refusing to call it that yet. The media is also refusing to refer to radical Islamic terrorism. Given that the presidential debate will be taking place next week this tragedy will likley play a role however small or large in it. Whether it be in influencing the structure of the questions or bringing attention to questions based on gun violence and gun control. 
As idiots like Colin Kaepernick took a knee to protest prejudice against blacks by police officers, cops in Charlotte, NC took a knee to pray before going to confront protesters. That says a lot and shows a huge difference. One is self-centered and obsessed over perceived slights, the other focuses on faith and God. A picture was taken by the North Carolina Troopers Association of these officers praying. It went viral almost immediately and with good reason. This is who we are. Radicals were bused into Charlotte to create havoc and violent chaos. They were also bused into Tulsa yesterday. We were fortunate here in that prayer prevailed and the protests were mostly peaceful. Charlotte was not so fortunate. I saw good people stand between the protesters and police trying to stop the radicals. I saw them kneel in the street praying that it would stop. Faith in God is colorblind… racism and violence are not of God.  From the Independent Review Journal: But after an officer-involved shooting in Charlotte left 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scottdead, another photo of people “taking a knee” began to circulate on social media. These people weren’t on their knees in protest, however. They were on their knees in prayer.  The photo, originally posted by the North Carolina Troopers Association, was shared nearly 100,000 times in less than 24 hours and included the following caption: “North Carolina State Troopers having a word of fellowship and prayer before being deployed on the streets of Charlotte. Please keep them in your thoughts and prayers as they work to protect us and help the city rebuild.” And the troopers weren’t alone. There were a number of people who took a knee in the streets, filling the gap between protesters and police:  People in Memphis knelt and bowed their heads as well. There were prayers said across the country and you know what? Race didn’t matter. There are a few people making this ugly and rioting in the streets. They are for the most part useful idiots egged on and controlled by Marxists whether they know it or not. I was heartened to see the Rapid Response Team from Billy Graham’s ministry there… they are good people of faith and are greatly needed in Charlotte right now. We need to turn away from this hate and division and turn towards God. He is the only one who will lead us out of this. I’m so very proud of these police officers… they have their priorities straight. Black Lives Matter is not a good group… they prefer violence and hatred, as opposed to prayer and faith.    
The earliest actual poll to come out of last nightâs debate was a CNN/ORC poll showing that 62 percent of respondents believed Hillary had won the debate. However, there are a ton of polls that were conducted online that say Trump won in a landslide. How can that be? Hereâs to answer that question: Are polls like this an accurate measure of how the electorate responded to Mondayâs debate? â Huffington Post (@HuffingtonPost) September 27, 2016  Why is this obvious joke of a poll so damning for all the online polls claiming Trump destroyed Hillary? Because this shows how online polls are meaningless. CNN actually contacted people. Anybody and everybody can answer an online poll. The results generally skew heavily to one side or the other, depending on the outletâs usual audience and which organizations/social media channels post poll links. Thereâs also the fact that Trumpkins from both 4chan and Reddit were stuffing last nightâs poll boxes, proving how easy it is to manipulate online polls. Of course, the Trumpkins arenât happy with at all for blowing those delusions out of the water: @HuffingtonPost someoneâs upset that #Trumpwins â Jim (@Jimbags12) September 27, 2016  @HuffingtonPost are middle schoolers doing reporting for you guys? â Timothy j. sims (@Timothyjsims2) September 27, 2016  Hope no one at Clemson got triggered for seeing this racist tweet. @HuffingtonPost pic.twitter.com/0KxxsNnMh5 â Michael Benson (@KeyMrB) September 27, 2016  @HuffingtonPost Please vote Hillary or else Bill Clinton will do things to me ð¢ pic.twitter.com/CsOON8nF3Y â Pneumonia WarMachine (@z3no_of_citium) September 27, 2016  And, obviously, we can always count on Trump himself to only tout the polls that say he won, because anything that doesnât show him as the winner, as the god he wants to be, is biased and unfair, and, well, who cares about those outlets anyway: I won every poll from last nights Presidential Debate â except for the little watched @CNN poll. â Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016  The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon â thank you! â Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016  Such a great honor. Final debate polls are in â and the MOVEMENT wins!#AmericaFirst #MAGA #ImWithYouhttps://t.co/3KWOl2ibaW pic.twitter.com/sfCEE3I5pF â Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016  He tweeted a story from the too, that carries a headline saying, âMajority of snap polls show Trump won debate by a landslide despite CNNâs overwhelming victory for Hillary in biggest official survey.â They actually looks like theyâre calling the results of the CNN poll into question with screencaps of every online poll in existence. Self-selecting polls aside, the result is pretty damn clear. Hillary won. 
From the Daily Caller News Foundation: Democratic Rep. Corrine Brown, who is currently facing felony charges for fraud, is trying to solicit donations online to fund her legal defense. Brown, who currently represents Florida’s 5th congressional district, was indicted in July on more than 20 counts of fraud. According to federal prosecutors, Brown and a collaborator presented the non-profit One Door for Education as a scholarship fund, but instead used its finances as a personal slush fund. Brown supposedly used the money to pay off back taxes and fund public events honoring herself. Despite raising $800,000, One Door awarded only a single $1,000 scholarship. Brown’s political fortunes have collapsed since the indictment, but she has refused to give in. She has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and has refused to resign her seat even after losing the Democratic primary in August. Now, Brown launched another fundraising campaign, trying to convince supporters they should fund her criminal defense. On the page for the Corrine Brown Legal Expense Trust, Brown argues that she is being prosecuted by sinister forces who want to bring down a powerful black woman. (Indicted Dem Congresswoman Compares Her Ordeal To Dallas Shooting) “During my entire political career, I have fought racism, injustice and advocated for individuals who normally get left behind,” the page says. “It should come as no surprise that some took offense to my efforts to stand up for you.” The page touts Brown’s various political deeds during her congressional career, such as increasing the amount of gas tax money returned to Florida, getting Congressional Gold Medals for the first black members of the Marine Corps, and fighting against “stand your ground” gun laws. A lack of money isn’t the only problem with Brown’s defense. Three of her legal teams have dropped the case, with the most recent one citing “an atmosphere of hostility and distrust” for its decision to drop Brown.

The Black Lives Matter movement is quick to cry foul whenever black people appear to be stereotyped. But what about situations when all the facts point to gang-related activity that is clearly racial and occurs against whites? That was the case in Atlanta, Georgia several weeks ago when a black gang entered the home of an 83-year-old white woman. That woman, Dorothy Dow, was sleeping in bed when a gang of four black men and women entered her home, beat her and then set her on fire. Dow passed away in the hospital recently from complications from the attack. Her attackers are now being charged with murder. Justin Grady, age 38, Cortavious Deshaun Heard, age 18, Mina Christine Ellery, age 17 and Angel Latrice Harmon age 17 are all being held without bond on charges of "felony murder and malice murder." The group entered Dow's home and pulled her from her bed where she was sleeping. One of the gang hit her repeatedly with a pistol, breaking the bones in her hand and her arm. Then Dow was covered in a flammable material and set on fire. She survived burning to death only because she pulled herself to a place where she knew she had kept a gallon jug of water. There she was able to pour the water on herself and put out the fire. Then, with a broken arm, she crawled to her cellphone and dialed 911.   The local news station gives no reasoning about why the attack occurred, but as we well know, had the races been reversed, the entire country would be burning from the Black Lives Matter protests. We need to stop with this duplicitous nature in America. Death is wrong. Violence is wrong. Race shouldn't matter. h/t: CBS Atlanta 
Oh Hillary, when will you learn? You never count your chickens before they’re hatched. Also, don’t say you’ve won when you clearly didn’t. The polls are in from last night’s debate. At first glance they do not look good for Donald Trump. According to focus groups from Fox News and CNN, both had Hillary winning last night’s debate. But were those true tests of the voting pool on the whole?  According to focus groups at both Fox News and CNN, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton handily defeated Republican Donald Trump in Monday’s presidential debate. At CNN, the focus group went 18-2 in favor of Clinton. And at Fox, pollster Frank Luntz’s group went 16-6 in favor of the former secretary of state. CNN’s group was a group of voters from Florida, while Luntz’s group was comprised of Pennsylvanians. Luntz, who tweeted frequently throughout the debate, said that Trump didn’t do well when he talked about his taxes but began to rebound when he knocked Clinton over her email scandal. However, Trump “tanked” when “trying to explain why he questioned Obama’s birthplace for so long.” But what no one is telling you is that another poll had Trump winning 92% to 8%.

A Marine family in Michigan said goodbye to its beloved K-9 with a fitting funeral. Rico was a Marine K-9 who served two tours in Afghanistan and was part of more than 240 missions and 30 firefights. He lived just over 12 years by the side of his owner, Marine Staff Sgt. Russ Beckley, Jr. “There was not a moment when it wasn’t his mission or his goal to be by my side. I was everything to him. And he was everything to me,” Beckley told WOOD.  After spending more than a year apart, Beckley and Rico were reunited in mid-June at the sergeant’s parents’ home. The dog was in declining health due to age, and the family had made the decision to have him put down. “Mainly I was thinking about how loyal he was to our family. To my son. To myself. And to our country,” Russ Beckley, Sr. said of his last moment with the dog. “He just kinda melted into my arms and we had a very nice goodbye.” Beckley said he “thanked Rico” for everything he’d done for him. “And I told him that I loved him,” he added. The dog then got a proper military send-off, with Beckley lowering his American flag to half-staff and visitors coming to pay their respects at a memorial set up by the family. Beckley and his father -- dressed in their uniforms -- carried their beloved dog in a flag-draped coffin. Beckley said that while it’s hard saying goodbye his beloved dog, he knows it isn’t the last time they’ll be together. “I can just imagine one day, seeing my great grandfather, my grandfather, my father and my mother, standing there with Rico. And we will all be together again,” he said. 
Obama just made himself out to be a grade A jerkface. The man thinks he has jokes, but after the joke he just told, someone needs to grab us a whole lot of rotten veggies…to throw at this horrid President. The man told jokes about ISIS and terrorism…and it just so happens to be on the same day that the U.S. gets bombed TWICE! It’s those kind of jokes that aren’t jokes really. You know, the kind people tell that want to be douchebags. The kind someone tells to look cool, but really just come out looking like an awful person. Yea, that’s the kind. …but it’s the timing that was SO wrong. Barack Obama was speaking at a dinner of the Congressional Black Caucus. He was surrounded by peers who non-think just like him, so naturally…he thought he’d try to be funny and ended up just looking like a total ass. Drum roll please…. “I don’t know about you guys, but I am so relieved that the whole birther thing is over,” Obama said. “I mean, ISIL, North Korea, poverty, climate change, none of those things weighed on my mind like the validity of my birth certificate.” Watch as Obama jokes at 1:55 in the video.  Now people think this joke was horrid for many different reasons. One, of course is because in the same day there were 2 explosions in the U.S. caused by bombs, and a horrid stabbing after someone shouted out two words… any guesses? “Allah Akbar!” of course… However, I think in addition to that…the man is the President of the United States. As such, I just plain expect better character from him. Maybe I’m old school, but if he is really relieved about the ‘birther’ thing being ‘over’ …. why is he talking about it, even if it’s by joke? Why usher in a whole new level of sarcastic, negative contention…with a non-joke by regurgitating a topic that not only is the least of our problems, but insults the focus on our ACTUAL problems? It’s bad form, bad character, and quite very unintelligent of him to do. But…why would we expect anything more from him. He’s Obama. 
NBA legend and fearless columnist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar just debunked the central pillar of the Trump campaign of fear, racism and religious intolerance as un-American fearmongering with a historical parallel every by one America’s greatest Presidents which each and every Democratic voter needs to know: Most Americans are familiar with Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s famous 1933 “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself” inaugural address. But the full quote was an even starker warning: “Let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself — nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.” Fear, Roosevelt said, causes us to retreat from our duty rather than advance our causes. This year, we are in danger of retreating from building the America we’re all supposed to be proud of, one that protects all and offers equal opportunity to all. The fact that the fear that sends some of us scuttling away is “unreasoning” and “unjustified” makes us cowards. Cowards abandon principles at the first sign of danger and look for witches to burn — or foreigners to blame. If there’s one stunning thing about the 2016 general election, it’s the total abandonment of the American experiment by the Republican Party in exchange for the mindless rhetoric of terror and obedience. Normal American politicians ask people to put their faith in our country and its institutions, but Trump told the Republican Convention this year that he alone could solve America’s problems – which is the boldest, least believable, total gospel to his supporters. Trump’s fearmongering on national television starting last year, coincided with a rapid escalation in hate crimes against Muslims over their religious freedom according to Abdul-Jabbar. In fact, 2015 was the worst year to be Muslim in America since 2001, which university researchers in California speculatively attribute to the “Trump effect.” However, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar isn’t just one of the NBA’s legends, nor is he just a columnist whose clarity of insight and strength of voice continues to grow as he opines on the American experience. Kareem is a peer of Donald Trump who grew up in New York City at the same time, but with regular parents and without the trappings of lots of cash, a rich daddy and enough taxpayer subsidy cash to build a sports arena. That’s why he nailed something essential about the Republican nominee’s fragile psyche: Trump’s method for convincing people to go along with doing what they know is fundamentally anti-American — and just plain evil — involves scaring voters with a constant barrage of lies and exaggerations. The fact that this propaganda is so effective is especially sad, because the nation that once stood up to bullies like Hitler, Castro and Khrushchev is now falling into goose-step behind a home-grown bully who seems afraid of everything that isn’t part of his entitled life, who responds to his irrational fears the way a child does. Kareem called out Trump’s fearmongering for what it truly is, the reaction of a child who never truly became a man above the shoulders. The Republican never had to grow up, to sink or swim, to stumble and fall and keep working until you make it or not. When Donald Trump plunged his casinos into what would be their first of many bankruptcies, he was put on an allowance by the banks. Let that sink in – a 40-year-old person, purportedly a grown up, who needs to be kept on an allowance. Who paid that allowance? The many big banks Trump claims to despise today. Worse, they delivered Trump a reward for failure was after he’d wrecked the fortunes of not only his investors, but also the many small business people who never got paid for building his maniacal Taj Majal. Trump ultimately wrecked Atlantic City itself, whose casino industry never recovered from Trump’s foolishly ego driven business plans that all of his contemporaries derided as lunacy. Trump can only sell fear, because under the suit, under the fancy airplane, which he wouldn’t have today without daddy’s money and connections, under it all, he’s only got the emotional maturity of a spoiled child. A spoiled child who in the finest Republican tradition like George W. Bush before him has always failed upwards. Now, Trump wants  to bring back the last failed Republican regime’s worst ideas in spades, along with racism, openly visceral discrimination and a new kind of fear America has never seen. After 9/11 the Bush administration openly used fear to manipulate the public and government policy to help their cronies. Trump wants to use the same fear mongering, but without any actual problems happening. Shamefully, too many Americans are ready to buy into this new Republic of Fear, but as Kareem Abdul Jabbar concluded: “Compassion and courage are what makes America great, not hate and fear.”
GQ journalist Drew Magary just penned a brutal takedown of Republican nominee Donald Trump and all of his supporters in an amusing and accurate – if rather profane – fashion. With fury and wit, Magary uses to article to exorcize the Trump demons in his heart, admitting that “Nothing’s gonna take down Trump at this point, so I’m not gonna bother. No no, this post is for ME. I am preaching to the sad little choir in my soul here.” The torrent of abuse he pours upon Trump and his far-right supporters are things that we all would love to scream at every car with a Trump sticker on it, at obnoxious Twitter handle with a smug Pepe The Nazi frog winking at you hurling racial slurs at you, every relative who launches into Benghazi conspiracies at Thanksgiving, at your jaded friend who just “can’t bring himself to vote this year,” at the sycophantic pundits that cut away from the President to a Trump rally…this is for all of them. Because while Trump is a miserable bastard, YOU are the people who have handed him the bullhorn. YOU are the people willing to embarrass this nation and put it on the brink of economic ruin all because you wanna throw an electoral hissy fit. YOU are the people who want to revolutionize the way America does business by voting for its worst businessman, a disgusting neon pig who only makes money when he causes problems for other people instead of solving them. YOU are the thin-skinned yokels who clutch your bandoliers whenever someone hurls the mildest of slurs at you (“deplorables”), while cheering Trump on as he leaves a bonfire of truly hateful invective everywhere he goes. YOU are the people willing to overlook the fact that Trump is an unqualified, ignorant sociopath because DURRRR HILLARY IS BAD TOO DURRRR.   Trump is human waste. He is the worst of America stuffed into a nacho cheese casing, and he is emblematic of the kind of arrogant, flag-waving, trashy, racist moron that the rest of us have to DRAG kicking and screaming into the 21st century: Cliven Bundy, Sean Hannity, Kim Davis, and on and on and on. Trump voters are the people who have spent the past decade or so voting insipid obstructionists into office, sending death threats to anyone who even mentions the idea of gun control, demanding 100% tax cuts on millions of dollars they can only daydream about making, and getting suckered in by any Oil Party candidate waving a NO GAYS flag. Fuck them. These are needy hillbilly loons who are just as starved for attention as Trump himself. And voting for Trump is their way of emulating him, of saying FUCK YOU to everyone else as a mission statement, with no regard for the fallout.  If you vote for him, you’re not making America great again. You are killing it. You are telling the world that America isn’t worth it. You are telling the world that all of our big talk about freedom and unity and ideals is just a load of shit, and that you would prefer a smoldering dystopia where freedom is just a flimsy cover for evildoing, led by a man who believes that strength is measured only in killing people. You are handing the most important job on Earth to Napoleon from Animal Farm. And you are revealing your breathtaking ignorance to everyone except for yourself. I can’t believe you can’t see this. I want you to see this. I wanna shine a big fucking light in your face and scream at you that Trump isn’t even qualified to be human, much less President. How are you gonna change the system if you elect some corrupt idiot who has no clue how to DO IT, huh? Can’t you see this? Haven’t you heard this asshole talk? THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU? But I already know that’s a futile effort. So fuck you, and fuck the GOP leaders who are too chickenshit to stand up to you. I’m not gonna wish deportation or imprisonment or some kind of fantastical hyperbolic death upon you. I’m not gonna ask for a wall to be built on the Mason-Dixon line. No no, I think you people deserve the EXACT same fate as Trump himself, and that is to lose, badly. That’s what should happen to you. You and your hamburger puppet leader deserve to live the rest of your days arm-in-arm in disgrace, branded as losers for eternity. Because that’s what you are. Couldn’t have said it better ourselves.

As WikiLeaks reports, the plan was to make Abedin Secretary of State. As President, Hillary Clinton will appoint Huma Abedin as Secretary of State. This according to leaked e mails between Abedin, Mrs. Clinton, and Clinton’s former chief of staff Cheryl Mills. Abedin, 40, would be the first Moslem Secretary of State, and one of the youngest ever. She would not, however, be the first foreign born Secretary of State. Henry Kissinger, 93, has that distinction, having been appointed by Richard Nixon. Huma Mahmood Abedin, 40, served as vice chairwoman of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign for President. Prior to that, she served as the deputy chief of staff to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton from 2009 to 2013. ABedin parlayed a 1996 Whitehouse internship into a role as Mrs. Clinton’s Right Hand Man, or Woman. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is listed as the supervisor certifying Abedin’s designation as a “special government employee. This classification allowed Abedin to work for an outside consulting firm and the Clinton Foundation, at the same time that she advised then Secretary of State Clinton. The Clinton campaign reiterated Sunday that Clinton did not personally sign documents for Abedin, or other employees. Hillary Clinton’s name was listed in print, but the signature underneath was redacted by the State Department. The document caused a stir and led to media reports Clinton had lied about not having been involved.. As you can see, the Clintons play “cover your ass” at every turn. They do whatever it takes to get what they need to accomplish without getting their own hands dirty. 
I’m so disappointed by this. We mentioned this on our show earlier this week, but the Perpetually Offended Brigade set their sights on Disney’s Maui Halloween Costume, calling it “brownface” and disrespectful to Polynesian cultures, and cultural appropriation, and probably a bunch of other stupid things that only perpetually offended losers get bent out of shape about. Here’s the Maui character from the upcoming Disney film Moana.  Perhaps you remember the outrage from a couple months ago, when people decided they were also angry that the Maui character is fat.  If you missed that story, here you go.  In that post, we are reminded that Maui is a demi-god character in an ANIMATED FICTIONAL DISNEY MOVIE.  And yet, people are still mad. But the outrage went even further, because now people are mad about the Maui Halloween costume.  Here’s what it looks like:  Infuriating, huh.  I mean, how DARE they create a costume that so closely resembles the character? Someone correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t the point of dressing up as a character for Halloween to look AS MUCH LIKE THAT CHARACTER as possible?  And if in fact, that IS the point, then WTF is all the fuss about?  The costume is made to look like the character.  WHICH IS FICTIONAL. That’s it.  End of story. But squeaky wheels apparently get the grease in our culture now, so Disney has pulled the costume, which I think is patently ridiculous.  They will no longer sell it.  Their statement said: “The team behind ‘Moana’ has taken great care to respect the cultures of the Pacific Islands that inspired the film, and we regret that the Maui costume has offended some. We sincerely apologize and are pulling the costume from our website and stores.” Translation:  We have no backbone.  Or testicles.  Or common sense. Please add this to the ever-growing list of things that progressives insist on being total killjoys about. Way to let the SJW morons win, Disney. Gawd.
Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump. First proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote. In other words, it would legalize voter intimidation. As Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process. âThereâs actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they wonât know the law, and theyâll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,â Gitlin said. âThat can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.â As we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim. And thatâs exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants. âWeâre going to watch Pennsylvania,â Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. âGo down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people donât come in and vote five times. If you do that, weâre not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion â I really mean this, Pennsylvania â is if cheating goes on.â Trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to âStop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!â In response to Trumpâs claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage. With the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trumpâs favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else. 
What a sign of the times it is when the terrorist who planted and detonated a number of explosives in New Jersey and New York City Saturday will be receiving better care than our own veterans who’ve fought to protect ourselves from men like him. It sounds unreal, but that’s the truth in Obama’s America. We’re all aware of the scandal at the Veteran’s Administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the VA had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency. Trump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. As BizPacReview reported: “We have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb,” he said of (the terrorist) Rahami. “Thank you, law enforcement. Thank you, police.” Then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. “But the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world,” said Trump. “He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he’ll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.” Watch below:  Wouldn’t it be nice if our Veterans received the same treatment? Instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the VA. There are also a number of veterans who have committed suicide either waiting for direct care or psychological care – a number of such suicides happening in VA parking lots.  We can provide state of the art medical care to a man who tried to slaughter innocent Americans – don’t you think it’s time the government gets its act together and starts providing it to those returning from the battlefield? I can’t imagine what it would feel like being one of the doctors using your time to rescue a man who died in a shootout with police, who had tried to massacre countless Americans due to his religious ideology. Admittedly, I think I’d be tempted to make a medical “error” or two. 
Once again, Donald Trump and the Republican Party’s fear-mongering about immigrants is proven false. Ever since an improvised explosive device injured 29 in Chelsea, New York City, Trump and his goons have revived one of their favorite talking points – vilifying Syrian refugees. “These attacks and many others were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system, which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country” yelled Trump at one of his notorious hate-rallies on September 19th. He later went on FOX News and in one broad stroke, painted all immigrants with outrageous hyperbole: “Think of it, Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands of these same people that are, you know, they have such hatred and sickness in their heart. It’s sickness, and it’s hatred, and she wants to allow hundreds of thousands more to come in.” In fact, Mr. Trump, the truth is the bombing was committed by a naturalized American citizen – and authorities caught the suspect thanks to a Sikh immigrant, Harinder Bains. He is the owner of the bar in whose doorway Ahmad Rahami decided to take a nap in. When Bains saw the man’s face on CNN, he did what any responsible citizen would do. He called the cops. “I did what I think every American would have done. My neighbor would have done the same thing. Any Jewish, Christian, Sikh, Muslim. Anybody would have done the same thing…I’m from Sikh faith. I’ve been taught always stand up against the atrocities, any kind of persecution” said Bains to CNN’s Chris Cuomo. He’s absolutely right – because our nation is a nation of immigrants. All of our forefathers are immigrants who colonized this land and committed genocide against the native peoples. Nobody has any more or less of a right to be here than everyone else, and picking on Syrian refugees because they’re Muslims fleeing chlorine gas and barrel bombs is the lowest of the low.  Our nation has accepted ten thousand refugees from Syria, a paltry number of the 4.6 milion Syrians that have been displaced by the horrifying violence of the Syrian Civil War. None of them have been connected to any domestic terrorist attacks in the United States.  The chance of being killed by a refugee in a terrorist attack is 1 in 3.6 billion; you are at much more danger from your own countrymen and their firearms. Mr. Bains’ actions reaffirm the notion that unity and welcome are our greatest assets. When immigrants feel accepted by a community, it becomes their community and they will work just as hard to defend it as anyone would. For instance, the Orlando shooter was reported to the FBI by an immigrant at his local mosque after he discovered evidence of Mateen’s radicalization; racist Trump supporters repaid him by burning his house of worship to the ground. Mr. Trump and his campaign’s racist rhetoric only serves to drive us apart and puts us in more danger. He is the real threat to America – not refugee or immigrants.
The Senate reconvened this week as Democrats introduced a transparency in Presidential candidates bill that would force Donald Trump to release his tax returns, if Republicans would only be willing to face everything their racist nominee has done in his business career: Democrats are backing legislation from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) that would require presidential candidates to release their tax returns within 15 days of receiving the party’s nomination. It would also require the FEC would release the documents after 30 days, if a candidate did not. “We’re going to be here next week. We’re probably going to have some downtime,” Sen.Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told reporters. “There’s no reason we couldn’t vote.” Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and her husband the former President Bill Clinton have both disclosed over 30 years worth of tax returns, and all of the Clinton Foundation’s returns too. In fact, since 1976 only one candidate has refused to release tax returns, and in that election Republican Gerald Ford kept his taxes secret, and left the Oval Office after losing to Democrat Jimmy Carter. In the 2012 election, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid voraciously and publicly called out Republican nominee Mitt Romney for only releasing two years of tax returns, saying that he was hiding his returns for over a decade and that the candidate had paid a very low or no tax on his income whatsoever. He was right! But America only found out just one week before the election, long after the start of early voting and absentee ballot mailing, when Bloomberg News published a definitive article on Romney’s taxes, which showed a huge income and no tax paid, validating the Democrat’s numerous public statements. According to The Hill: Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who has called out the GOP presidential nominee nearly every day recently, added Thursday that Trump is “ethically compromised” and the “king of the welfare kings.” Ironically, Romney’s father George Romney was a Republican candidate for President before him, and started the tradition of American politicians disclosing their financial details when running to become Commander in Chief. American voters deserve to know what’s inside Republican nominee Donald Trump’s tax returns, to make the most informed votes possible. Because we all know every last detail about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s finances and personal history, but outside of lying, racism and narcissistic self-love, the orange-faced one is still a mystery.
The Weiner is back, yet again, in the news and if you thought he couldn’t get any more disgusting, well you would be stupid…I mean, come on. It’s Anthony “Douche” Weiner…I like the sound of that. Anyways, back in January, Anthony Weiner, 51, who at the time wasn’t in the process of divorce with top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, supposedly engaged in a months-long online sexual relationship with a troubled 15 year-old girl whose name is being withheld for obvious reasons.  “I have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent,” stated Weiner as he was interviewed on FoxNews Online. The details are this. Back in January of 2016, Weiner had developed a knowing online sexting relationship with a 15 year-old girl. We know that he knew she was 15 because using the KIK, a popular social media app, he had asked the girl what high school she went to. Yeah, that kind of drains all doubt that he didn’t know she was underage. Let’s not forget, this man is married. So sexting with anyone but his wife still reveals that he’s just as horrible a person as ever…except now we know just how disgusting and evil this piece of turd is. Both the girl and Weiner sent sexually charged pictures and texts back and forth. Weiner also eventually ended up at the girl’s home when her father wasn’t there. The girl claims that he prodded her into deeper sexual conversation until she stated she wasn’t comfortable with where it was heading and he immediately stopped.   The girl’s father is justifiably enraged by what has transpired and claims his daughter’s mental health is in jeopardy. “If there’s anybody out there that has a similar story that they can come forward, maybe use my daughter’s example to have the courage to come forward, I agreed because her mental health is in jeopardy and I didn’t want to exacerbate anything that she has mentally going on,” he continued. She’s gone through some depression, we’ve sought counseling and been able to help her work through it, he said. She’s a bright girl, very smart, so this has somewhat dulled the light that she had previous to this…it’s gut-wrenching to see somebody take that away.” Alright Dad. Wiener is a scumbag and he is a sexual predator, no doubt…but let’s give some sense of responsibility to where it’s due. Your daughter engaged in the relationship. She is not some innocent angel you believe she is. How the hell does Weiner end up inside your home? Did he break in? Just be honest about it. Weiner’s a sick piece of trash that most likely will serve jail time. About time. 
Student groups at Ramapo College were allegedly forced to change the theme of an “American BBQ” because the administration deemed it too “offensive.” The event was to be co-hosted by the College Republicans and two residence halls, but one residence hall director reported that flyers advertising the event were deemed too “military and recruitment-oriented” because they featured Uncle Sam. Students at Ramapo College were recently forced to change the theme of an “American BBQ” because the administration deemed it too “offensive.” According to emails obtained by Campus Reform, Ariana Rivera, the Assistant Residence Director of Bischoff Hall, sent an email to the College Republicans and the College Democrats on August 17 inviting the groups to co-sponsor an American-themed BBQ with Bischoff and Mackin Halls. The proposal called for the CRs and CDs to run tables for their respective organizations at the event, as well as encouraging students to register to vote, and CR President Taylor Gilson responded almost immediately to affirm that her group would participate.  However, on September 14, just two days before the scheduled event, Rivera wrote to Gilson, again, this time regretfully explaining that Bischoff Hall would no longer be co-sponsoring with the CRs because the American theme was “considered offensive.” Rivera subsequently reported that the event would not be entirely cancelled, after all, but that it would have to be a… Read the rest of the story at Campus Reform  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.
Hillary Clinton has almost no ground game in Ohio. The video below shows what he found.  The Clinton campaign is reportedly formidable. Hillary Clinton brags about the number of employees work on the campaign. Then there are the volunteers. Most Americans know that Ohio is a critical state in the election. At one point it was reported that Clinton had over 681 paid staffers, and Trump only had 68. Given those numbers, the Clinton campaign certainly has the upper hand over Trump, right? Further, though Trump has beefed up his ground game nationally, Clinton has added to her staff. Latest numbers have the Clinton campaign now with over 1000 paid staffers. The Trump staffer had heard that there was a door knocking campaign, so he went down to check it out. There was an office with chairs set up for a conference style setup. The office had one guy. A bit of time passed, when a woman came out and introduced herself. Besides a few volunteers behind the counter, that describes the Clinton machine in that part of OH. When the Trump surrogate begins discussing the truth about the operation, they don’t take it too well. When you can count your volunteers on barely two hands, you have a problem. This certainly explains the “enthusiasm gap” that has Leftist media in a conniption. It further explains why Clinton can’t seal the deal. Latest polls have Trump either closing fast or taking the lead. His fundraising certainly proves there is more enthusiasm for Trump, than Clinton. 
While rock band U2âs Bono has had a career of being politically outspoken, his priorities have generally been focused â primarily on improving living conditions in underdeveloped countries. Heck, the liberal Bono even found common ground with George W. Bush. Thereâs no common ground to be found with Donald Trump, though, who the U2 singer called âpotentially the worst idea that every happened to America.â In an interview with , Bono gave credence to the idea of American exceptionalism, but he feels that Trump destroys that. In fact, Bono says, Trump could âdestroyâ the very idea of America: âLook, America is like the best idea the world ever came up with,â Bono, whose real name is Paul David Hewson, told âCBS This Morningâ in an interview broadcast Tuesday. âBut Donald Trump is potentially the worst idea that ever happened to America. Potentially.â Bono pointed to nations like Ireland and Great Britain as great countries but suggested that America is different because itâs an idea, one that Trump is âtrying to hijack.â âThat idea is bound up in justice and equality for all â equality and justice for all, you know,â he continued. âI think heâs hijacked the party. I think heâs trying to hijack the idea of America. And I think itâs bigger than all of us. I think itâs â itâs â this is really dangerous.â Source: Politico Hereâs the video:  Say what you want about the often controversial Bono, but he has seen the world and heâs right. The idea of America, as a melting pot, as a place where with hard work, anyone can be a success, is not completely incompatible with Donald Trumpâs ideas. Trump is a xenophobe. He and his supporters want to turn our nation into a solitary island. Thatâs never been what our nation is about. 
The so called “small government” Republicans running the state of Michigan are so fond of letting communities run their own affairs that they’ve blocked the city of Flint from being able to sue the state after the Governor’s specially-appointed “emergency manager” made a series of decisions that led to the mass poisoning of thousands with lead-tainted water. Just days after Flint’s Mayor Karen Weaver indicated that her town might sue the state, Republican Governor Rick Snyder and his appointed five-man Receivership Transition Advisory Board changed the rules, preventing the city from suing without approval from the Advisory Board. House Speaker Kevin Cotter (R-Mt. Pleasant) complained that “a reckless lawsuit could throw the state budget into disarray and undermine everything we’ve done for the city.” They’ve done quite enough to make the lives of Flint citizens worse already. Gov. Snyder’s senseless Tea Party tax cuts blew gigantic holes in the state budget, prompting him to appoint emergency “managers” to rule bankrupt cities without any oversight from local governments. Those managers then arranged the switch from the Detroit water system to the heavily polluted Flint River water, ostensibly to “save money” but accusations of orchestrating a conspiracy to privatize the water company make the situation even murkier. Released emails showed that the Governor’s office ignored and dismissed complaints from the concerned consumers, all the while charging them the most expensive water prices in the country and hiding the fact that their water was tainted with lead and other dangerous toxins for nearly a year after the administration had learned of the contamination. Now, the so-called “small government” conservatives are blocking the city from seeking justice in the gross mismanagement and mass poisoning of its citizens. It’s a hypocrisy that has played out time and time again in red Midwestern states; Republican politicians scream and howl about the tyranny of the Obama administration but then decide to, say, ban cities in Oklahoma from banning fracking, where the land has become so unstable from fracking operations that earthquakes are now a weekly occurrence. It’s just another piece of evidence which shows that Republicans only exist to serve their corporate masters; they don’t even pretend to respect the opinions and rights of the people they supposedly represent.
There’s nothing wrong with protesting a perceived injustice. One of our most cherished American rights is the right to peacefully assemble — to protest. However, that’s often not what happens when Black Lives Matter activists set out to make a statement. Too often, they don’t understand what the words “peaceful protest” mean. That was proved true once again in North Carolina last night, when a Black Lives Matter mob descended upon a highway and began attacking people. The rioters began by throwing rocks at cars and trucks, protesting the shooting of a black man on that same highway.  VIDEO: this is what we saw overnight; protestors throwing rocks, blocking a major interstate, face-to-face w/@cmpd @TWCNewsCLT #KeithScott pic.twitter.com/BvhuBKj4X9 — Christina Watkins (@CWatkinsTV) September 21, 2016   But it quickly became dangerous, when the mob ambushed a female truck driver. She was trapped in the truck as the rioters looted her truck, stealing the goods and lighting them on fire, all while she was inside. She called police, but they never came. Instead, a media chopper got footage of the violence.  🤕Try & picture Collapsing Hillary Clinton getting out of bed to deal with Chaos & Violence in N.C #KeithLamontScott pic.twitter.com/KAVPlHmWPb — DEPLORABLE TRUMPCAT (@Darren32895836) September 21, 2016       It didn’t stop there, though; by the end of the night, 16 police officers were injured and the freeway had been shut down.   Message to these Black Lives Matter protesters: this doesn’t help your cause. Protesting the killing of a black man at the hands of police is a valid thing to do. Shutting down a freeway, throwing rocks at cars, attacking an innocent truck driver and injuring 16 police officers is not. That’s not a protest; it’s a riot. And it doesn’t endear anyone to the Black Lives Matter cause. It makes racial division worse and inflames racial tension. That doesn’t fix anything. Martin Luther King, Jr. encouraged people to use love, hope and integrity to make a difference when he was fighting for civil rights. It’s shameful to see the Black Lives Matter movement literally doing the exact opposite. Instead of love, they spread anger and hatred and intolerance. They encourage black people to see themselves as perpetual victims and white people as racist oppressors. How they are able to look at themselves in the mirror without feeling deep shame for their actions is truly beyond comprehension. 
Famed television host and veteran Montel Williams got into it this weekend with Trump-supporting Pastor Mark Burns, who took to Twitter to complain about the mainstream media’s refusal to jump to conclusions and immediately call the weekend’s bombing in New York “terrorism.” Montel, a New Yorker, was not about to let the Trump apologist get away with repeating the same fear-mongering narrative that Trump repeats after every terrorist attack that takes place in the West. Montel called him and Trump out for being a con men, shaming him for being a pastor with the nerve to support a narcissist like Trump.                  Donald Trump clearly believes that he is a minor deity and has no concern for anything but his own ambitions, and Pastor Burns’ support for him is an obviously opportunistic move by a man willing to sacrifice his principles for money. Williams is absolutely right to call him out on it. A bombing suspect over the explosion in Chelsea and the placing of several other improvised explosive devices throughout New Jersey is in custody.
Donald Trump is perhaps the most predictable person who’s ever run for president. If someone disses him, they are enemies for life, and if someone says something positive about the self-proclaimed (we won’t believe it unless he releases his tax returns) billionaire, brutal dictator or not, they will have Trump’s loyalty and respect. Now, things get a little weird when people are sarcastic, as is the case with a Washington Post article that, if you didn’t read it, might be something somewhat positive about the GOP nominee. Trump obviously didn’t read the article. He would have hated it, but he did retweet the article entitled “Donald Trump’s birther event is the greatest trick he’s ever pulled”: “Donald Trump’s birther event is the greatest trick he’s ever pulled”https://t.co/zvVQnxeiQ9 — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2016  Most of us, at least those of us who are capable of critical thought, would probably not assume that the article was a positive portrayal of Trump’s birther farce, but, well, we’re talking about Trump. As for the article, no, it was pretty brutal toward Trump. Here are a few snippets: Donald Trump is, at heart, a showman. He rose to national fame thanks to star turns on reality TV in which he played the tough-talking boss to a group of aspirants hoping to become as successful as he has been in business. His great gift is the ability to draw attention — and then use that attention for his own, usually commercial, purposes. Trump might have read that far. He’s proud of being a showman and he’s pretty damned good at it, in much the same way that snake oil salesmen were good at their jobs. Trump may have outdone himself on Friday morning. He and his campaign touted a “major” announcement at his newly opened hotel in Washington, D.C., at 10 a.m. The word was that Trump would walk away from his past skepticism about President Obama’s citizenship while also laying the blame for the birther movement at the feet of Hillary Clinton. (That, of course, isn’t true — according to numerous fact-checkers — but no matter: Trump planned to say it anyway.) The article goes on to fact check some of Trump’s many lies, especially in regard to the birther controversy. No, Hillary Clinton didn’t start it and yes, Donald Trump has long been a birther. The Washington Post then went on to describe the event, and it wasn’t flattering. This is how they described Trump’s announcement: Three sentences from Trump himself — one that is totally false and two others that represent a total reversal from a position he held as recently as, well, Thursday night. Clearly, Trump didn’t read the article, which is a little frightening. Presidents are given several pages, if not hundreds, of important documents ever single day. It’s critical that our President read and not just assume and retweet. 
TrumpâsÂ campaign chair of Mahoning County, Ohio, one of the most crucial counties in the state, made what might be the most delusional statement of the week. She insisted that racism was literally non-existent before Obama was elected. Wow, it doesnât take much to tear apart how this assertion is completely absurd, but weâre going to take the time to do it anyway. In an interview with The Guardian, Kathy Miller, the campaign chair in question, made the following shocking statement: âI donât think there was any racism until Obama got elected. Â We never had problems like this.â She must mean that white people were relatively shielded from being forcedÂ to face the fact that racism is, in fact, abound in white culture. Â Even though that, in all honestly, is a load of bunk too. She went on to make some extremely offensive statements to the black community overall, willfully remaining ignorant of how many hardships Black Americans face every. single. day: âIf youâre black and you havenât been successful in the last 50 years, itâs your own fault. Â Youâve had every opportunity, it was given to you. Â Youâve had the same schools everybody else went to. Â You had benefits to go to college that white kids didnât have. Â You had all the advantages and didnât take advantage. Â Itâs not our fault, certainly.â *Cringe* Seeing as apparently this isnât evident to people like Kathy Miller, and arguably much of Trumpâs voter base, letâs just go through why this is completely bogus and extremely offensive. She even went so far as to say that racism didnât exist when she grew upâ¦in the 1960s. Â What?! Â Segregation?!?! Black people have had to deal with a racist criminal justice system which unfairly targets their community, damaging their families and placing their children at a disadvantage from the very beginning. Black children have primarily had to go to schools which are dominated by a white power structure, a power structure which has certainly not gotten rid of its racist roots to this day. Â Either that, or they often go to a school which is worse off economically. Black people were literally enslaved or cut off from the resources and wealth of the white by law for centuries. Â The racist nature within that legal system wasnât just erased with the end of segregation. Â Has it improved? Â Sure, but that hasnât addressed the structural racism within our socio-political and economic paradigm. Because of a history of oppression, black people have been economically much worse off. Â And children who come from poor families, as study after study shows, statistically do worse in school. Â They also canât afford skyrocketing college tuition when they get out of high school. Black children are often disproportionately punished in schools, which harms their potential for academic success. Honestly, I could go on and on, and Iâm not even black, so I donât know the half of it. This lady is delusional, her beliefs are dangerous to the health of our society, and the fact that we have this kind of racism so prevalent in the Trump campaign, a United States presidential campaign, is horrifying. But itâs all Obamaâs fault, right? UPDATE: Kathy Miller resigned after blowback from these comments.
Usually, nobody says Trump is ready for battle louder than Trump’s senior advisor Rudy Giuliani, but after his candidate suffered a bruising defeat last night at the hands of Hillary Clinton’s, the histrionic former New York Mayor had a different solution for his fact-less Republican nominee. Giuliani knows that the racist Republican nominee cannot possibly win any debate involving facts, so he told NBC what he’d do if possible: “If I were Donald Trump I wouldn’t participate in another debate unless I was promised that a journalist would act like a journalist and not an incorrect, ignorant fact checker.” That’s right. Trump should drop out of the debates because facts are hard. The Hill reported specifically that the former prosecutor Giuliani was most upset over Lester Holt’s accurate fact check (that even NYPD agreed with) that “stop and frisk,” as practiced under his watch in New York, was definitively declared unconstitutional by a judge: “If journalism has ethics, Lester Holt unethically interfering in the area of law he knows nothing about,” Giuliani said. “It is not unconstitutional and Trump’s description of that case was correct.” When the two tangled, it was always about the facts, and each time Lester Holt stood solely on the sturdiest ground. Republicans aren’t enamored with facts, and often try to pretend recorded statements don’t exist, so it wasn’t surprising that Giuliani tried to backtrack instantly to NBC. After realizing that he’d just made “Spin Room” headlines, he said “I did not say what I’m advising, I’m saying what I would do. Whatever advice I give to Donald Trump, I’ll give to Donald Trump.” Lester Holt did an acceptable job as moderator last night, upsetting partisans on both sides while managing not to blow any key moments with odd remarks or lasting moments of shame. The Republican nominee made several desperate “hail mary throw” sales pitches to the American people last night, but outside of his base it played disastrously.  
The extremely exhausted Hillary and her extremely boring VP pick have written a book that is currently #5,301 on the Amazon books bestseller list. It’s really quite laughable that with only a little more than one month until the general election, Hillary can be found desperately hawking a book nobody wants to read at a rally in a tiny community center gymnasium in Orlando with only 300 people. That would be funny in and of itself, but Hillary’s desperation to sell a horrible book to a tiny and lethargic crowd (who are likely being paid to occupy seats) is not even the best part of the story. It turns out, the book reviews written by Amazon users are a must read! They’re hilarious, revealing, and for the most part, when they are describing Crooked Hillary to a tee… These are some of the most clever and funniest reviews you will ever see for a political book! Enjoy…  A special thank you to GP and @FessEnden4 for making our day! Hillary in Orlando hawking her deplorable book from the stage.

The epidemic of black men being killed at the hands of police officers in America has not gone unnoticed on the international stage. According to a According to a report by a United Nations working group, which will be debated at the U.N. Human Rights Council on Monday, this situation constitutes a full-blown “human rights crisis” that is reminiscent of the days of lynchings. “Contemporary police killings and the trauma that they create are reminiscent of the past racial terror of lynching,” said the report by the U.N. Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent. The U.N. report draws a stark comparison between modern day fatal shootings at the hands of law enforcement and the lynchings of blacks that swept the nation in the 19th and 20th centuries. The report comes as racial tensions in America have boiled over yet again in the wake of more deadly shootings that have rocked the country. Historically, the majority of African Americans killed in lynchings were hanged. The Equal Justice Initiative released a report in 2015 which said that between 1877 and 1950, an estimated 3,959 black people were murdered in “racial terror lynchings” throughout the country’s southern states. The U.N. report follows a January visit to the U.S. by a five-member group, which was chaired by Filipino law professor Ricardo A. Sunga III. The group says that despite efforts at reform, they still remain “extremely concerned” about the “human rights crisis” facing blacks living in the U.S., and this is especially true considering protesters are once again flooding the streets of American cities to protest the killings of still more black men in recent days. “In particular, the legacy of colonial history, enslavement, racial subordination and segregation, racial terrorism and racial inequality in the United States remains a serious challenge, as there has been no real commitment to reparations and to truth and reconciliation for people of African descent. “Impunity for State violence has resulted in the current human rights crisis and must be addressed as a matter of urgency.” The experts’ group pointed out that these killings go unpunished because the investigation is biased and tainted from the beginning since police departments are investigating their own. Adding to this is the fact that prosecutors have discretion when it comes to presenting charges and U.S. law enforcement officers are not held to international standards for use of force. To address the situation, they recommended that the U.S. institute a system to reliably track police killings nationwide and instances of excessive use of force. They also said that racial profiling must be brought to an end, which is “a rampant practice and seriously damages the trust between African-Americans and law enforcement officials.” The group also said that improving race relations will also require education that must be “accompanied by acts of reconciliation” in order to successfully overcome the bigotry that plagues the U.S. and the past injustices that have been perpetrated against black people on American soil. The report added that the lasting negative effects caused by enslavement and racial injustice must be recognized by both federal and state laws. 
This past Saturday night our Divider-in-Chief was at it again. This time he lectured the attendees at the 46th Annual Legislative Conference Phoenix Awards Dinner of the Congressional Black Caucus. What did he lecture them about? Hillary. Yep, he told them that he would be personally insulted if they didn’t vote for Hillary. Here’s what he said: “My name may not be on the ballot but our progress is on the ballot. Tolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot. Ending mass incarceration, that’s on the ballot right now. And there is one candidate who will advance those things. And there is another candidate whose defining principle, the central theme of hos candidacy is opposition to all that we have done. There’s no such thing as a vote that doesn’t matter. It all matters, and after we have achieved historic turnout in 2008 and 2012, especially in the African-American community, I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy, if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election. You want to give me a good sendoff? Go vote!”   We definitely want to give you a sendoff Mr. President. And it can’t be soon enough. But this business of being personally insulted if someone does not vote the way you tell them, is arrogant, not to mention juvenile. Get over it. If not voting for Hillary is an insult to you, then consider yourself insulted, because there are many Americans of every color who will not be voting for Hillary. And your legacy? You’ve done a fine job of insulting your own legacy with all the disastrous decisions and programs you’ve implemented. No one needs to help you insult your legacy, it’s a mess. The Democrat way is to shame people into voting the way they want them to. But the people in that room deserve the respect of not being lectured about who they MUST vote for. So save the preaching for those who want to hear it. Your legacy is one of causing division and Hillary will pick up where you left off, if she is elected. And that can’t be fixed. Trump 2016.   
Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is a stud. He knows how to govern which is not something I can say for the POTUS (President of the United States). Gov. Abbott, representing Texas, informed the Office of Refugee Resettlement that they would be withdrawing from the program on Jan. 31, 2017. This past weekend there were several terrorist attacks in the United States (of which Obama has yet to have any decent response) that have given pause to any thinking leader in our nation to allow Muslim refugees into their state. The biggest issue for Gov. Abbott is that Obama hasn’t been able to ensure the states that the refugees being sent are not terrorists or do not pose a terror threat. He had his Texas administration draft a plan that would require federal national security officials to provide assurances that none of the individuals being resettled pose a terror threat. “The federal government’s refugee settlement program is riddled with serious problems that pose a threat to our nation,” the governor said in a statement. “The director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the director of national intelligence have repeatedly declared their inability to fully screen refugees from terrorist-based nations. Even with the inability to properly vet refugees from Syria and countries known to be supporters or propagators of terrorism, President Obama is now ineptly proposing a dramatic increase in the number of refugees to be resettled in the U.S.” “While many refugees pose no danger, some pose grave danger, like the Iraqi refugee with ties to ISIS who was arrested earlier this year after he plotted to set off bombs at two malls in Houston,” Abbott said. “Despite multiple requests by the state of Texas, the federal government lacks the capability or the will to distinguish the dangerous from the harmless, and Texas will not be an accomplice to such dereliction of duty to the American people,” he added. “Therefore, Texas will withdraw from the refugee resettlement program. I strongly urge the federal government to completely overhaul a broken and flawed refugee program that increasingly risks American lives.” Can you blame a Governor whose main goal is to protect his constituents? I’m pretty sure Liberals think he is evil and will paint him to be a villain, racist who selfishly refuses to share his resources with poor refugees with nowhere else to turn. But the thing he’s not willing to share are the lives of women and children sitting in a shopping mall drinking an Orange Julius unprepared for a suicide bomber to sit at the table next to them. This is America, let’s keep it that way. If other countries want their citizens to live in terror, it is their right. It is also our right to implement strategies of security. 
For weeks, Donald Trump and his henchmen have tried to paint a picture of Hillary Clinton that suggests she’s physically and mentally unfit to be the next president. Whenever Clinton coughed, they would claim she had one foot in the grave. When she fainted on 9/11, Trump and his people were pounced with glee. Then we discover she tried to tough it out with walking pneumonia, and suddenly they turned that into an attack on her honesty. So going into the presidential debates, everyone was waiting for Trump to unleash some sort of attack on Clinton’s health. And once it started to become apparent that he was losing the debate, the billionaire did just that. When addressing the issue of race in America, Trump said: “You look at the inner cities, and I just left Detriot, and I just left Philidelphia. And I just…You know. You’ve seen me I’ve been all over the place. Uh, You decided to stay home and I mean that’s okay…But I will tell you. I’ve been all over and I’ve met some of the greatest people I’ll ever meet within these communities. And they are very very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.” Clinton’s response was perfect. “I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And yes I did. And you know what else I prepared for?” There was a slight pause before she continued: “I prepared to be president and I think that’s a good thing.” Image via Giphy The expression on Trump’s face following Clinton’s comeback was priceless. See for yourself.  Some critics pointed out that Clinton’s “gotcha line” came off as rehearsed. But isn’t that sort of the point she was making? The point is that Clinton did rehearse, she studied, and prepared, not just for one debate, but also for an important job that entails far more significant consequences for bad decisions than low TV ratings and lawsuits. America saw just who the real adult was in this contest and at the end of the day that’s the person you hire to do the most important job in the world. Featured image via YouTube.  Only in America can some smarty-pants Negro think that teaching American students to exercise their American freedom of speech guaranteed by the American constitution can be considered American.
President Obama routinely paints a rosy picture regarding the war on terror. He assures us that ISIS is decimated and that we have little to fear from the looming presence of radical Islam throughout the world.   He’s wrong. Not only are we engaged culturally in a very serious war with radical Islam, at best, our military efforts can only be described as hindrances to the advancement of the murderous elements of Islam. However, as weak as our response to ISIS has been, it is satisfying to see that our airstrikes are making life more difficult for the terrorist factions that require money to wage war. According to an Iraqi source, ISIS has begun harvesting the organs of their dead and dying in order to traffic the organs for cash as our airstrikes decimate their oil fields and rob them of the riches therein. “Special medical unit of the organization proceeded to steal human organs for about 23 ISIS militants of those who slept in the hospitals of Nineveh,” the Iraqi source said. “What has been stolen from those members included the kidneys, intestines and more; they were transferred under tight control to affiliated hospital on the outskirts of the city.” The source who wished to remain anonymous for obvious reasons, said that the move comes as a reaction to the decimation of oil fields. “This came after the loss of the majority of sources of financial funding, particularly with regard to crude oil, which it provides about 80% of the imports of the terrorist organization.” It is gratifying to see that ISIS must tighten their belts. However, what the world needs is a complete and thorough domination and destruction of radical Islam and so long as the Western world confuses idiocy with tolerance, it’s unlikely that we will see the leadership necessary to fix this problem. 
LeAnn Rimes opens up about the truth behind her divorce, and depression. I had no idea she went through all of this! LeAnn Rimes life looks pretty perfect if you take a glance at her success or her social media accounts, but the truth is that it isn’t always roses and rainbows for the country star. In fact, it hasn’t been that way at all for her. Even now after getting ready for her new album release she has shared some of the most intimate secrets that none of us knew about. She has been through a lot over the years, and of course all of it was extremely public which didn’t make it any easier.  In an interview with Hello! magazine she opened up about all of the hardships she has been over the past couple of years and it broke our hearts. One thing you may not know is that she took her former manager and her father into court for stealing money from her. It was already hard enough for LeAnn having all of the pressure from the public, but when her father betrayed her it was a harder pill to swallow. That wasn’t all that she has been through though. After her divorce with Dean Sheremet she ended up checking herself into rehab for depression.  The country star had an affair on her husband with her now current husband Dean Sheremet and it was one of the most publicized scandals in music at the time. She has struggled with all of these circumstances over the past years and she quit making new music. Now the country star is ready to come out with her new album “Remnant” and she opened up about how all of these life events have made her into the woman she is today. She says that this record isn’t going to be like any other. This album is going to be her “tell-all”. She is going to walk her fans through the past ten years of her life and how it has all helped her grow as a person – it is the most vulnerable album of hers to date. “This is a powerful record for me. I’m in my 30s now and whether it’s in your 30s or at some other point in your life, everyone will go through a kind of crumbling of sorts and for me it was about trying to do that as gracefully as possible…There is a real beauty in allowing that to happen as you get to pick up the piece and rebuild them to find out who you really are. Starting in the music industry so young, there were so many influences that weren’t truly me, but this album comes from the inside out.”  She added that many women will be able to relate to it, and she is excited for the release. “I know I’m not the only one that’s been through heartache and that so many women can relate to it. The last album was coming from chaos and this one if coming from love. I feel very settled now…”  We are so proud of LeAnn! So many women will be able to relate to this!
Sheriff David Clarke talked to Neil Cavuto of Fox News. Clarke determines that the rioters behavior in Charlotte is of primitive and subhuman nature. Basically, he called them savage and uncivilized. Sheriff Clarke is right. If you watch any video footage of the Charlotte riots, then you will see nothing but idiots running around like maniacs, people stealing and breaking into multiple stores, vehicles being damaged, people being attacked for no reason. It’s nothing by mayhem by maniacs. None of these people resemble civilized humans. Clarke is right! These ingrates are subhuman. They’re less than human. They’re filthy degenerates who consistently ruin neighborhoods and they need to be fixed. When people commit crimes like this, then I don’t think they should be permitted to have kids. Sounds rough and crazy, but I’d love to see the government waltz through one of these neighborhoods, see someone they saw looting, and revoke their right to have kids. Hey, I saw you acting like an uncivilized moron in Charlotte. You know what, you’re done having kids. Unzip your pants and let’s sterilize you right here in front of everyone. If you’re that irresponsible now, then I can’t fathom you raising a child. If you do have a kid, they’ll be just like you, and we don’t want any of that. Here’s what else happened in the interview with Cavuto and Clarke – they point out that Keith Lamont Scott had a gun and would not drop his weapon. They point out the fact that democratic media outlets always REFUSE to provide that information. They want ratings. They want people mad. They’re literally spinning the story, or leaving out vital information, in order to get people irritated enough to riot, then they get some good ratings for covering it. It’s total nonsense and very irresponsible. In fact, I would say that the reason for the riots is the democratic news outlets. If they said from the start – the man had a gun, that’s why he got shot, then people wouldn’t really care. But that doesn’t get ratings, does it?  politistick – After Cavuto pointed out that major news headlines in the Democrat Media Complex, ranging from the Washington Post to the New York Times, conveniently left out the fact that Keith Lamont Scott, the black man shot by a black police officer, was armed and refused to drop his weapon, according to police, Sheriff Clarke, as is always the case, did not mince words in describing both the media malpractice as well as the rioters’ behavior. “It was done on purpose [the media leaving out that Keith Lamont Scott had a gun] to stoke up anger and resentment by the liberal mainstream media,” Sheriff Clarke asserted. The combination of uncivilized subhuman behavior and information left out of the news is what causes BS riots. Charlotte riots could have been avoided if democratic news outlets told the truth instead of pandering the urban culture for votes and ratings. 
Before the debate has begun, Clinton has been out-trumped. Apparently Clinton will have billionaire Mark Cuban sitting in the front row of the debate. Some believe this move would intimidate Trump, though the two billionaires don’t really have much of a past together. Cuban recently challenged Trump to a “sit down” to discuss policy for 4 hours with no Clinton-bashing. If Trump accepted, Cuban agreed to donate $1 million to charity. Why Cuban has decided to jump in the presidential fray, since he is as significant in the discussion as navel lint. One might believe that with the ineffectiveness of Hillary Clinton’s “not so secret weapon,” Bill Clinton, that Cuban has become her surrogate. Other than ignore Cuban, if I were Trump, I would have donated $1 million to my own charity, then proclaimed victory over Cuban. My statement would be, “Mark Cuban is a publicity seeker who needs me to be relevant.” As for Hillary Clinton bringing Cuban, this strategy will backfire. To some degree it already has, as in Trump’s response, Hillary Clinton has already been out-trumped. As reported by the Washington Post: Gennifer Flowers, who revealed a sexual relationship with Bill Clinton in the 1990s, is saying she will attend Monday night’s debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton as Trump’s guest. Flowers’s assistant confirmed the decision to BuzzFeed’s Andrew Kaczynski Saturday afternoon, and Flowers herself told the New York Times in a text message, “Yes, I will be there.” The decision was the latest play in a bizarre bit of gamesmanship between the Clinton and Trump campaigns over the debate. Clinton’s camp confirmed this week that it would invite billionaire mogul Mark Cuban, a Trump antagonist, to the debate. First, Cuban is insignificant. It would be different if Trump hadn’t already marginalized Cuban. Cuban said Trump wasn’t wealthy, then later retracted the statement after more careful examination of Trump’s finances. Cuban is kooky. Sure he’s successful, but not as successful as Trump. Next, by bringing in Cuban, Hillary Clinton opened herself up for LOTS of damage. Trump has already responded by bringing in Jennifer Flowers, a move sure to open more moves. But this may be only the beginning. But Trump has many more “mind-screws” he can do on Hillary and it can all happen before the debate. For example, Trump could invite Anita Broderick, and reference her when Hillary discusses the war on women. He could invite Linda Tripp, and have Linda appear with the infamous “blue dress.” Or Trump could go for the jugular and invite Monica Lewinsky. Perhaps Trump could invite the families of the Benghazi victims, or a few Bernie or Bust supporters. Hillary Clinton has let the genie out of the bottle, and this genie is not her friend. Hillary Clinton has out-trumped herself. 
That wacky, deplorable, Oompa Loompa stand-in Donald Trump is at it again! As part of his continuing African-American “outreach” — which has traditionally consisted  of calling black people uneducated, unemployed and desperate, and their communities poor (“no health care, no education, no anything” as he puts it), and posting white supremacist memes demonizing black people. While Trump’s white supporters love this rhetoric because it a.) confirms their biases against African-Americans and b.) seems to them that he is trying to fix problems they suspect exist, proving he’s not the racist pig liberals say he is, the rest of us wonder how anyone can think a guy who literally labeled black rental applicants’ forms with “C” and practiced discrimination could be viewed as a person who would do anything at all to help the black community. On Tuesday, Trump again continued his outreach — or, as the rest of us see it, again made his disdain for black people known — by telling African-Americans (or, more correctly, a room full of white people) that black communities are “in the worst shape that they’ve ever been in before, ever.” .@realDonaldTrump: African-American communities "in the worst shape that they’ve ever been in before, ever." https://t.co/9LBPglLJSo — ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 20, 2016  Naturally, the Internet had some remarks about this, with many wondering how he forgot about Jim Crow, slavery, and other times the black community might have had it just a teensy bit harder in America: @ABCPolitics @realDonaldTrump Slavery?

This actually happened in June, but is just as pertinent today, especially with 20,000 to 30,000 Syrian refugees due to arrive in the US next weekend. Police in New Mexico pulled over a woman driving a vehicle. The drive was an undocumented Muslim woman from the Middle East… that’s bad enough, but what is even worse is what she had in her car. The woman had plans for a gas pipeline with her. This just screams ‘terrorism’. I have no idea why they pulled her over, but it was a very good thing they did. It has been widely reported that hundreds, if not thousands, of Islamic illegal immigrants are trying to get across our southern border. Judicial Watch released a report last summer saying that Mexican cartels are smuggling foreigners from countries with terrorist links into the country. They furthermore released a second report just a few months ago saying that Islamic terror groups residing in Mexico have begun traveling to America in order to seek out potential targets. That border has now become a literal ticking time bomb of terrorism. It’s not ‘if’, it’s ‘when’ we get hit with a horrific terror attack that could kill thousands and it can all be laid at the feet of Barack Obama and the Marxists who are for open borders. They want America to be like Europe… Europe which is toast because of the Hijrah Migration and terrorism. No thanks. From Mad World News: Police in New Mexico recently pulled over a vehicle only to find that it was being driven by an undocumented, Middle Eastern woman. However, the situation got worse when they saw what she had in the car with her at the time – and now the surrounding area is on high alert. Judicial Watch indicates that a deputy sheriff in Luna County, New Mexico pulled over an unidentified “Islamic refugee” for an undisclosed reason. Luckily for everyone involved, the minor traffic infraction turned into so much more when the officer found plans for a gas pipeline in her possession. The pipeline is in Deming, New Mexico, and U.S. Border Patrol and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTF) have been sent to the area to investigate. Unfortunately, the find could only be indicative of what is to come. Obama could bring in up to 250,000 Islamic refugees this next year. He is seeding them across America in conservative strongholds in an effort to change the voting demographic and terraform the US into an Islamic nation. Bringing in unvetted Islamists guarantees ISIS terrorists in their midst and Obama is good with that. What’s a few dead infidels to him? The plans this woman had in her possession include the region around the small town of Deming about 35 miles north of the Mexican border and 60 miles west of Las Cruces. Thanks to high unemployment, poverty, crime and a horrible public education system, Deming has been named No. 1 on a list of the “ten worst places” to live in New Mexico. The entire region is considered a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area due to large amounts of meth, heroin, cocaine and marijuana smuggled through the state by Mexican traffickers. The brutal Juárez and Sinaloa cartels operate in that area. The media has swept this under the rug, but it is a severe national security threat. This election may pivot on it, especially if we get hit. Our leaders owe it to their constituents to put our safety first, lock down that border and vet these refugees and illegal immigrants. Before we lose countless Americans to terrorism that is.  
Doesn’t this piss you off, even just a little bit? All the garbage going down in the NFL with players and teams and now nationwide in highschools disrespecting the national anthem, FOR Blacklivesmatter. …and nothing happens to them, because it’s their right. Now another athlete speaks AGAINST BlackLivesMatter and he gets suspended…for an entire season? How do they figure? Seattle Mariners catcher Steve Clevenger has been suspended for criticizing Black Lives Matter and President Obama. “BLM is pathetic once again! Obama you are pathetic once again! Everyone involved should be locked behind bars like animals!” the backup catcher tweeted out about the riots in Charlotte. He also tweeted, “Black people beating whites when a thug got shot holding a gun by a black officer haha shit cracks me up! Keep kneeling for the Anthem!” The Mariners announced on Friday that he would be suspended for the rest of the season without pay. Clevenger will lose out on about $30,000 in salary according to ESPN reporter Darren Rovell. And of course…as always, the apology. Statement from Steve Clevenger “First and foremost I would like to apologize to the Seattle Mariners, my teammates, my family and the fans of our great game for the distraction my tweets on my personal twitter page caused when they went public earlier today. I am sickened by the idea that anyone would think of me in racist terms. My tweets were reactionary to the events I saw on the news and were worded beyond poorly at best and I can see how and why someone could read into my tweets far more deeply than how I actually feel. “I grew up on the streets of Baltimore, a city I love to this very day. I grew up in a very culturally diverse area of America and I am very proud to come from there. I am also proud that my inner circle of friends has never been defined by race but by the content of their character. Any former teammate or anyone who has met me can attest to this and I pride myself on not being a judgemental person. I just ask that the public not judge me because of an ill worded tweet. “I do believe that supporting our First Amendment rights and supporting local law enforcement are not mutually exclusive. With everything going on in the world I really just want what is best for everyone regardless of who they are. I like many Americans are frustrated by a lot of things in the world and I would like to be a part of the dialogue moving forward to make this a better world for everyone. ” I once again apologize to anyone who was offended today and I just ask you not judge me off of a social media posting. Thank you and God bless everyone.” Steve Clevenger While those in support of BlackLivesMatter continue to put our first responders in dangers, loot our businesses and beat up whoever they want…and still have DC releasing statement that support them.. like “we feel your pain” … This man gets severe consequences for simply unleashing his frustration in the form of words on social media. Sometimes I really hate this planet…and this is one of those times.
President Obama has always been a far left borderline socialist progressive liberal. Their is no denying that. Why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the Affordable Care Act, gun control, and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees. Well apparently he has not changed his tune. Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President. While there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about American freedom that will have most Americans absolutely flabbergasted at. During his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order. Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome. He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions, such as the United Nations for example. Obama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves. But apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs. He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right. I hope he’s enjoying that Gilligan’s Island by himself. How ridiculous! He knows his constituents do not agree with him but he is so pompous and arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise. That perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses Washington D.C. right now. If the leader of our country cannot broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so. It’s like parents who tell their kids to do one thing and then literally do exactly what they told their kids not to do. Then they wonder why they misbehave. Watch President Obama’s full speech here,  
Milwaukee Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. has been a fixture on Fox News in recent months, appearing on multiple programs on that network to attack the Black Lives Matter movement, which he has compared several times to international terrorists. Clarke has also been an outspoken supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, and is often one of the first names Trump backers bring up when attempting to highlight support for the candidate among black voters. Clarke spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this past summer. But while he was busy on the cable network attacking the black community, a man died in the jail under his command. He reportedly died of thirst, of all things. Terrill Thomas, 38, was found dead in a Milwaukee County Jail cell on April 24, nine days after being arrested in connection with a shooting. Other inmates heard Thomas beg for water in the days before he died, the Journal Sentinel reported in July. [â¦] Last week the Milwaukee County medical examiner announced that Thomasâ death was due to profound dehydration, according to the Journal Sentinel. By labeling the death a homicide, the medical examiner indicated that it was caused by the actions of another person, although that judgment does not necessarily mean that anyone will be criminally prosecuted in the case. Inmates at the jail say the water in Thomasâ jail cell had been cut off for 6 days, and that one inmate warned jailers about the danger to the manâs life. Attorney Erik J. Heipt told the site that he has received calls from other inmates to tell him that the water had been cut off to their cells, and another inmate died in 2011 when his water was cut off as well. Clarke is reportedly part of a pro-Trump bus tour arranged by a super PAC that is supporting the candidate. The Huffington Post also reports that Clarke took in over $150,000 in 2015 from âspeaking fees, travel reimbursements and gifts.â

Hillary just gets punked over and over again these days. Her latest embarrassment came at a rally where some guy yelled, “Hillary for prison!” To which Hillary replied, “Let’s make it happen!” The entire nation finally agrees with Hillary Clinton on something. But I’m sure she got confused (yet again) and didn’t mean to say that. She must have misheard the guy and thought that he said something like, “Hillary for president!” Funny and pathetic all at once. Not to be outdone, Elizabeth Warren posed for a selfie with someone she thought was a Hillary supporter… not so much. She got punked as well with the young man saying, “But you lied about your ethnicity!” He also said Hillary would lose to Trump which caused a back and forth. That just made it worse for Warren. Cringeworthingly humiliating. (Photo: Getty) From InfoWars: Hillary Clinton was caught in an embarrassing moment when someone at her rally yelled “Hillary for prison!”, to which the presidential candidate responded, “Let’s make it happen!”  The cringeworthy moment was captured on film. Given her now notorious propensity for being constantly “confused,” Hillary probably thought the man was saying “Hillary for president!,” but nothing could be further from the truth. The “Hillary for prison!” meme has been going on now for some time. Born out of a frustration that she has not been held accountable for even the slightest of her crimes, the slogan reflects the mood of America. And Trump has capitalized on it brilliantly. ‘Hillary for Prison 2016’ has become the theme of the Grand Old Party – Americans see what the Hildabeast is… the most corrupt politician to ever run for office in our country. Since the GOP convention, it has been the rallying cry of those who support Donald Trump and even those who don’t. Hillary’s own associates and friends say that she is corrupt beyond belief. Between the scandals plaguing Clinton and her severe health issues, Trump is now leading her in the polls. And with the renewed terrorism threats and the support of the police union, Trump is sure to surge even further ahead. Clinton looks frail, weak and tainted… if the country is besieged by terrorist attack after attack, they will turn to a strongman like Donald Trump and beg for his leadership. God help us. America is changing and not for the better. Be careful what you wish for, you may just get it.   
Hillary Clinton, on her campaign plane, responds to explosion in NYC pic.twitter.com/4tfyUE2vNc — Liz Kreutz (@ABCLiz) September 18, 2016  
It’s been said that the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun, but in the case of the Minnesota mall attacker, to quote another cliche, he brought a knife to a gun fight. Last Saturday set the bar for the poorest execution of a terrorist attack to date. Five explosives were planted around the tri-State area, killing nobody. One bomb was supposed to detonate during a 5k race for veterans – but detonated before the race even began. Another explosive went off in NYC that night, but despite injuries, nobody was killed.  Also occurring on Saturday was a machete attack in a mall in Minnesota. Nine were injured during the attacks, where the attacker was shouting “Allah Akbar” during (but the media still thought there was a debate over the motives for the attack). Eventually he was shot numerous times and killed. The man who killed him was an off-duty police officer, an instructor of a concealed carry class, and a competitive shooter. In other words, a good guy with a gun that even Allah couldn’t save him from. For the first time since the incident, he’s speaking out. As ABC News reported: The off-duty police officer who shot and killed the knife-wielding Minnesota mall attacker said he is staying out of the spotlight until the investigation is over but is grateful for all the messages of support he has received. Jason Falconer, who has been hailed a hero by many Americans, including the president, went right back to work after bravely intervening in Saturday’s stabbing attack at the Crossroads Center mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota, according to local ABC News affiliate KSTP-TV. Dahir Ahmed Adan, 20, began stabbing people at the shopping center; 10 suffered injuries. None of the injuries are life-threatening, authorities said. Falconer shot Adan dead, and authorities believe his quick action saved lives. Falconer spoke to KSTP-TV at Tactical Advantage, a firearms shop where he is an employee. He said he was at the mall on Saturday “buying his son’s birthday present,” which he was able to take home, despite the horrific scene that unfolded. Falconer said he shot at Adan “to stop the threat.” Countless others were spared from being hacked, potentially to death, thanks to Falconer’s actions. Japanese Marshal Admiral and the commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet during World War II Isoroku Yamamoto once famously stated that you can’t invade mainland America, “because there would be a rifle behind every blade of glass.” Unlike our neighbors across the sea in Europe, we’re armed to the teeth, and any Jihadi who tries to wreck havok is in for one hell of a surprise. 
WHAT THE HELL? Hell is exactly where these people, and I use that term extremely mildly, are going. Anarchists in Charlotte rendered a photographer unconscious then tried to throw him into a burning trash can. I repeat… These Black Lives Matter domestic terrorists tried to throw an unconscious man into a fire! One of our crews was attacked in Uptown. Reporter & Cameraman taken by ambulance to hospital. — Mike Hanson (@MikeWCNC) September 22, 2016  WCCB is reporting a few people tried to put a news photographer into a flaming trashcan and police came to his aid — Jonathan Jones (@jjones9) September 22, 2016  #WCCB witnessed protesters try to throw still photographer into fire in Uptown #Charlotte. https://t.co/T6i8AH5iGu #CharlotteProtest #news pic.twitter.com/t26WgIlwOh — WCCB, Charlotte's CW (@WCCBCharlotte) September 22, 2016  Picture of fire in Uptown #Charlotte during protest.

These “people” are referred to as “demonstrators” and “protesters.” News media who denigrated the Tea Party simply say about this filth, “No one condones this violence, but…” But? There is no freaking but! Every single person who is participating in this violent anarchy and mayhem should be arrested. Period. No excuses. No buts. No “you have to understand.” YOU have to understand that this type of animalistic response has no place, none, in a civil society. This is the very environment that Barack Obama created back in 2009 when he, without knowing all the facts, said “The Cambridge Police acted stupidly.” This is on Barack Obama’s hands. It’s also on the hands of every single person who has condoned the increasing violence of the Black Lives Matter as simply being the actions of people who are angry. This is on the hands of everyone, from Al Sharpton to Jesse Jackson and Hillary Clinton, who perpetuated the “hands up, don’t shoot” lie of Ferguson from which this madness spawned. Please pray for this TV crew who are now hospitalized, thanks to these people doing the devil’s work, when they were just trying to do their job. Pray for other reporters out there as well. Another one was intentionally knocked down earlier. How the hell does this “start a conversation” or even get people to be sympathetic to you? And don’t tell me it was just a few. No one came to the aid of this man who was unconscious. If it wasn’t for the police coming to his rescue, he would have burned to death. And to think, these “people” are protesting with an outcry of “oppression” and they just tried to burn someone to death after rendering him unconscious. h/t The Right Scoop  Email Subscribe
It’s no wonder Trump is losing — and losing badly — with women. A new poll from McClatchy-Marist shows Clinton leading Trump by 24 points among registered female voters (58 percent to 34 percent), and 23 points among likely female voters. Remember, Mitt Romney lost the female vote by 11 points, and John McCain by 13 points. While the Trump campaign and his supporters scratch their heads as to why he’s performing so poorly with the demographic that makes up the majority of the country, the Clinton campaign is reminding them why. A new (and brutal) ad has just been released from the Clinton camp. Asking voters if Trump is “the president we want for our daughters?” the ad, titled Mirrors, uses the Donald’s deplorable, sexist, offensive and objectifying words against women From, “I’d look her right in that ugly face of hers,” to “A person who’s flat-chested is very hard for them to be a 10,” showcases women all across the country looking at themselves — their bodies, appearance — at their phones, wondering if they are worthy, as Trump’s disgusting words echo off the screen. When talking about Kim Kardashian, Trump thought it would be a good idea to talk about her famous asset: “Does she have a good body? No. Does she have a fat ass? Absolutely.” So presidential. The most damning part comes at the end, when Howard Stern asks Trump, “So you treat women with respect?” Trump’s answer? “No, I can’t say that either.” This ad is so powerful. Trump, who is well known to be a serial misogynist, sexist, and all around pig, should be ashamed of the way he regards women, their appearances, and livelihoods. No wonder his first wife cited ‘cruel and inhumane’ treatment as the grounds for their divorce, and called him a “chauvinist” on TV. Little girls, and indeed little boys, are watching. Their parents have a choice: do we elect a man who has a proven track record of demeaning women he doesn’t even know, or do we elect a woman who wants to tap everyone’s potential, no matter who they are or what they look like. Watch the powerful ad that showcases just how much of a pig Donald Trump is:  
Paul Combetta, an IT specialist who helped Hillary Clinton wipe her server clean of evidence requested from federal authorities, took to online forums to find advice on how to commit the crime. Combetta cited his Fifth Amendment rights in refusing to answer questions before a congressional committee last week, but was pretty talkative when trying to find out information from fellow IT experts on how to forge Clinton’s e-mails. Under a posting on 8chan titled “Here is clear proof that Hillary sought to destroy evidence,” Combetta can be seen posting under a username he uses multiple times across multiple platforms, ‘stonetear.’ In a screenshot of the discussion, Combetta (or stonetear) can be seen telling others “I need to strip out a VIP’s (VERY VIP) email address from a bunch of archived emails.” Presumably, that VIP would be Secretary of State Clinton. Whoa. HRod’s now immunity-protected BleachBitter Paul Combetta on REDDIT two years ago. https://t.co/M7khmkEek0 pic.twitter.com/KqHJhiRerY — Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) September 19, 2016    Later on in the thread, Combetta asks if there’s a way to “rewrite” the e-mails for his ‘VIP.’ One user tries to warn Combetta that changing the e-mails is not possible as it “could result in major legal issues.” SMOKING GUN: “BleachBit” Paul Combetta ASKED TO STRIP OR REPLACE VIP’s EMAIL ADDRESS! https://t.co/nz13MqzWth #MAGA pic.twitter.com/qQII96JI76 — Katica (@GOPPollAnalyst) September 19, 2016    As word began circulating that Combetta had been caught red-handed asking how to illegally forge Hillary’s e-mails, the man known as ‘stonetear’ began deleting his messages on the forum. Twitter user Erik Jones took video in which he refreshed his screen to show the messages disappearing. Watch … Hillarys bleackbit specialist Paul Combetta deleting all of his reddit posts on video. @Lauren_Southern @Cernovichhttps://t.co/KZ9trBVpys — Erik Jones (@SMOKeMON_TRAINR) September 19, 2016  Hillary’s IT guy made the post on July 24, 2014 and can be read in it’s entirety below: [July 24, 2014] Hello all- I may be facing a very interesting situation where I need to strip out a VIP’s (VERY VIP) email address from a bunch of archived email that I have both in a live Exchange mailbox, as well as a PST file. Basically, they don’t want the VIP’s email address exposed to anyone, and want to be able to either strip out or replace the email address in the to/from fields in all of the emails we want to send out. I am not sure if something like this is possible with PowerShell, or exporting all of the emails to MSG and doing find/replaces with a batch processing program of some sort. Does anyone have experience with something like this, and/or suggestions on how this might be accomplished? It’s important to note the date, which was within 24 hours of a recent New York Post report that showed Combetta at that time trying to ship archived data to Clinton Executive Services Corp., or CESC, which handles logistics for Hillary and Bill Clinton. Was this the same data he was trying to forge or strip of evidence? Combetta would eventually delete the archive of Clinton emails and scrub them from the server, knowing full-well the House Committee on Benghazi had requested retention of the information. Combetta has reportedly been given immunity by the Obama Justice Department and was not charged. Comment: Is this the smoking gun of intent that FBI Director James Comey said he couldn’t find in allowing Hillary to avoid indictment? Tell us your thoughts below.  
NFL spirals even further into the gutter after the Miami Dolphins announce that they will be joining in on the Kaepernick roadshow of disrespecting, ungrateful, and entitled MULTI-MILLIONS-DOLLAR idiot athletes. This time though…there will be consequences for their stupidity. Just as they made the announcement, the police union also had one of theirs’ to make, and you might like this. Like…a lot. The Dolphin players who are sitting out during the “Star-Spangled Banner” believe that their butt to chair crap is going to help the black community. Of course, using their multi-millions to help make the community better isn’t their idea of helping…no, that would be too much for them to commit to. So instead, they take easiest more INEFFECTIVE choice…because they are selfish a-holes like that. …yet the ‘black community’ they are “helping” adores them for it. Really? It’s insanity really. Their dishonorable Black Lives Matter protest is against the very men and women who are willing to sacrifice EVERYTHING, and have proven it time and time again when they HAVE. It’s sick. Of course, many are not taking a stand for something they believe in but taking a stand to try and stay relevant. Just like Colin Kaepernick, his career was deteriorating…and he needed something. However, what they probably don’t get yet…is in this case, not even BAD publicity is going to be good for them. Not when it involves hatred towards our heroes. That’s just bad form… So now, guess what? Since the Dolphin players have confirmed that they will continue kneeling during the National Anthem, the police union has responded with their own announcement. They are calling for Broward County Sheriff’s Office to stop providing police escorts for the ungrateful, selfish, and wretched team. Association president Jeff Bell announced on the union’s Facebook page that they have contacted the executive board not only to condemn the anti-police, pro-BLM actions of the Dolphins but also to request that they cease attending events in which they’re unwanted. “We have buried coworkers who have unnecessarily lost their lives protecting the lives of individuals. Some law enforcement officers even lost their lives while protecting the lives of the very same individuals who were protesting against law enforcement. The Broward Sheriff’s Office Deputies Association Local 6020 is seeking the immediate termination of all Miami Dolphin escorts until such time the Miami Dolphins and the National Football League set forth a policy that will not tolerate the disrespect of the American Flag and National Anthem during any sanctioned games or events.” Of course the police union understands that it is the right of these entitled morons to choose to disrespect the flag, and country that allows them to live out their dreams…but it is also the right of the police officers to decide that they won’t provide optional security to those who don’t want them there and wish them harm because of ignorance. How hypocritical right? I’m embarrassed really. The world is definitely rooting for America to win, because if we don’t…they don’t either. However, I’m sure they are watching in on what is happening here…and shaking their heads. We are no longer a leading nation…that others can look to and respect. Not with that idiot President in the White House that only knows how to lead from behind, divide a people, and cause chaos among brothers and sisters. He is no leader…look at the garbage that is going on now. Of course, the 4 Miami players who refused to stand for the anthem immediately attempted to downplay their disrespect after word surfaced that the sheriff’s office may boycott their events. According to the Daily Dolphin, Jelani Jenkins provided an absurdly hypocritical response, saying that he wasn’t insulting law enforcement or the military. “Most important, man, I just want equal rights for everybody,” Jenkins said Sunday. “Hopefully we’re raising awareness and pushing for change. I want it to be known that it’s no disrespect to the military or to police officers. And 9/11, I respect everything about it. My perspective is that there are people hurting. It means a lot to me to not be quiet about it.” So minorities in America don’t have equal rights? Well if that were true, I myself would not even exist. My parents immigrated to America with nothing but their hard work ethic, and hope for better days in a free land. Now they are living their dreams that were awarded to them by this free country through their sheer will power and hard work. Also, raising up 3 great Police Officers to serve and protect in their communities and me… who chooses to follow in their footsteps in teaching my children to be grateful and have love for country and respect and honor for our heroes. So… these fools, can take a seat. Their message is redundant. 
The first major polls of last night’s debate are out and show a resounding victory for Hillary Clinton across the board, whose poise, demeanor, and experience shown through in contrast to Donald Trump, who was repeatedly obnoxious and vapid in his babbling responses.  VOX rounded them up, and here’s the results: A poll of debate watchers by CNN/ORC, which found that 62 percent thought Clinton won and 27 percent thought Trump did. CNN’s David Chalian emphasized on air that the sample was 10 points more Democratic than in a typical poll, but that’s still a strong win for Clinton. A poll of debate watchers by Public Policy Polling, which found that 51 percent thought Clinton won and 40 percent thought Trump won. A focus group of 20 undecided Florida voters by CNN found that 18 of them thought Clinton won. And a focus group of Pennsylvania voters by GOP pollster Frank Luntz overwhelmingly thought Clinton had won. Libby Nelson has more details about that here. That tremendous advantage for Clinton is crucial, given that some 50% of likely voters have said that the debates will help inform their decision. Facts, experience, and respect clearly matter to the voters, and last night’s debate showed once again that all three are on the side of Mrs. Clinton. 
Judge Jeanine Pirro has been outspoken against Hillary Clinton for some time, but never more so when the infamous “deplorable” comment was mentioned by ol’ Hillary. In Pirro’s most recent opening statement, she absolutely UNLOADED on Clinton, and it’s one you’re going to want to play on repeat. “This week, Hillary’s all better, and she and her surrogates call on all Americans—all but us ‘Deplorables’—to stand up and repudiate Donald Trump’s divisive rhetoric—through their own divisive rhetoric!” Pirro said in her Opening Statement. “Hillary is so desperate for the black vote that she insists on creating race issues,” she said, playing a clip of Clinton last week accusing Trump of “describ[ing] the black community in such insulting and ignorant terms.” “Isn’t Donald Trump speaking to the problems of the minority communities in inner cities? Maybe your recent health issues have prevented you from grasping the reality of inner city crime,” Pirro said, adding that her criticisms of Trump could easily be an indictment of her own actions. “You choose to create division—you look for a target: the police, Donald Trump, a common enemy. Then you promise the world and you have the gall to actually say “imagine someone who distorts the truth to fit a very narrow view of the world…who sees someone who doesn’t look like him and agree with him, and thinks that person must not be a real America.” “This is exactly what you said when you called us ‘deplorable’,” Pirro said. “I know you have double-vision and memory problems—documented by the FBI—but your hypocrisy is stunning. You’re the ‘hater’. You’re the one who said ‘we are above all that’.”  Hillary Clinton is the one that’s calling racism when it’s the Democrats, PROVEN by the DNC email leak, who are the true racists. They preach tolerance and equality, but they utilize that platform to keep minority populations at bay and not let them thrive. It’s absolutely appalling and we shouldn’t stand for it. This is just another nail in the political coffin for Clinton. Soon she’ll be gone from our minds and Trump will be president. You can make that happen this November. (Source: Fox News) 
Ken E. Nwadike Jr. is part of the much talked about Free Hugs Project. According to the group, they try to be separate in their approach to getting there and explain it as “an initiative that spreads love, inspires change and raises awareness of social issues through motivational videos.”  He’s been a very busy bee this year and who would’ve guessed? That was a joke…he’s been to each party’s rallies and shown the way to healing through love. Now I’m no smelly hippie, but from what I’ve witnessed so far, this movement can go a long ways in changing hearts and minds to peace. Yet, when Nwadike decided to visit Charlotte during the riots and hugged members of the Charlotte Police Department last night, all hell broke loose with the protesters on the other side of the picket line. Nwadike was called a phrase that we won’t repeat in print…by protesters who seemed to be just shocked that he was actually switching ‘sides’ and hugging law enforcement that were posted up at the scene. He then tried to do something rioters are sorely known for and that is ‘reason’ with a few, but to no avail. He stated firmly that he is neither on the side of the cops, nor BLM…but that he is for peace and is staying neutral. He then gives the most reasoned and simple example of how we need to put things into perspective and tells one protester that an officer’s uniform doesn’t make him a killer, or a robot, just like how his (pointing to the man) skin color doesn’t make him a criminal. We are all just brothers and sisters. “This man [pointing to the officer] gave me a hug, and he wants to fight me because of that; how does that make sense spreading more hate into the world?” Nwadike yelled over the crowd. “That’s what’s frustrating me, we can’t love one another?” Nwadike then stated “If I couldn’t find work, if I was not blessed to have a job, guess what I would do—I would join the military, I would be a police officer—I would find work in order to feed my children,” Nwadike is incredibly reasoned and wise, and will no doubt, play a major role in healing this nation from hate.   
Incredible. Democrat asks a question, Republican has an answer, a powerful answer. Democrat proceeds to get mad, and uses interruption and deceiving chain of words and emotions to keep the powerful answer from being heard. Not only is that terribly embarrassing…but the Democrat just ends up looking like a total asshat. In this case…it seems like Randy Perkins (said Democrat) needs some serious ‘anger management’ therapy. I mean, the man went from 0 to 100 in 10 seconds flat! On a topic he couldn’t digest himself…but was the very person to bring it to the plate! Classic Dem… Randy “Hot Head” Perkins is running for Congress in Florida’s 18th district. Enter former U.S. Army Special Operations soldier Sgt. Brian Mast, who is his Republican opponent. Mast has served under the Joint Special Operation Command as an Explosives, Ordinance and Demolition Bomb Technician. Basically, he risks his life going one on one with actual bombs, before they detonate and wipe life out…and so much more. In 2010, as he was conducting an operation in Afghanistan, Mast found himself once more coming face to face with an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) that didn’t go down without taking a part of Mast with it. He lost both his legs and suffered great injury to his left arm, and STILL went on to volunteer and serve with the Israeli Defense Forces in Israel. This is the man that you are about to watch on video being unfairly attacked by Randy “Hot Head” Perkins. Keep that in mind as you watch the interaction or lack thereof between the two. Did you see that? Perkins gave nothing but absolute disregard and disrespect to Mast in a situation that he himself, had set up. That’s enough to make you want to reach right into your computer screen and slap that guy. Of course Mast is qualified, and Perkins just helped to prove it. When has anger ever been the method of problem solving? Anger is a good method to get the motivation to problem solve…but is absolutely destructive to use while fixing what needs to be fixed. Who in their right mind wants a man like Perkins in charge? He’s just proven himself to be an ogre! While at the sametime showing people that Mast is level headed, and calm in situations that most people would start swinging fists… Mast is qualified because he has proven he is willing to sacrifice for America and Americans. A great leader possesses values of integrity, accountability, and the ability to keep a good sense of humor, even in troubled times. I’d say Mast just gave a good example of that, thanks to Perkins. He kept cool, and even showed he had good sense of humor when he chuckled a little in disbelief. He made his claims and was asked to prove why they were true, and took no hesitation in doing so, despite Perkins changing the angle every 2 seconds to throw him off. Heck, earlier we wanted to slap Perkins…but maybe we should be thanking him for burying himself? Look, it’s not too hard to divide the good men from the bad when they make it so obvious themselves. However, as further witness of Mast’s good character, you should know that Freedom Daily met with him at CPAC this year. As expected he is a very humble and down to earth guy, even after all the horrors he has witnessed on the battlefield where he has given up his quality of life for you, me and our children. We assure you, this attack that Perkins unleashed on Mast… is absolutely uncalled for. 
In case it wasn’t clear enough already, Black Lives Matter truly is an anti-police group. We’ve all heard the talking point before, that they’re “anti-police brutality, not anti-police” but their actions betray them. One of the co-founders of the BLM movement, Alicia Garzia, proved that the movement was anti-cop just the other day when she called for “cop-free” zones. She had explained (as quoted in the Daily Caller) that “The United States gives too much respect to police officers, explaining that when police do wrong, a few bad cops are blamed, rather than a “corroded and corrupt system.” She concluded that “Quite frankly, many of our [Black Lives Matter] members are continuing to investigate what it would mean to have police-free communities. I think what we’ve continued to see over time is that no moral appeal is actually stopping the deaths of black people, whether they be armed or unarmed.” Does she not realize that more black lives would be lost if their communities lacked police? Apparently not. We’ve seen the horrible chants of BLM before, whether it be “What do we want? Dead cops!” or “pigs in a blanket, fry em like bacon!” and now they have a new one. As Breitbart reported: At least one Black Lives Matter protester in Houston was reported to yell “F**k blue lives” while others chanted “Pig, pig, bang, bang.” The anti-police rhetoric came during a protest march in Houston’s predominantly black historic Third Ward on Saturday evening. The protest began in McGregor Park after the release of the dashcam video by Charlotte, North Carolina, police showing the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, a black man, by a black police officer. On September 22, a white female officer in Tulsa was charged with first-degree manslaughter after she shot and killed Terence Crutcher. As reported by Breitbart News and the AP, Officer Betty Shelby was charged after dashcam and aerial footage showed the shooting and Crutcher walking away from the officer with his arms in the air. The footage does not include a clear view of when the officer fired the sole shot that killed the 40-year-old black man. At one point, a confrontation developed between the protesters and police, according to the Houston Chronicle’s Keri Blakinger. The standoff occurred in a parking lot on the University of Houston campus. Ultimately, the protesters backed up and took a different path. “F**k blue lives,” shouted one protester that Blakinger described as “particularly incensed.” She reported others chanting “Pig, pig, bang, bang.” The protesters occasionally blocked street intersections remained peaceful and out of the flow of traffic during the protest. These are the crazies that Hillary Clinton is sympathizing with. Is there any surprise that the largest police union in America endorsed Trump? Of course not. BLM has only made racial tensions worse, and widened the divide between police and the public. This certainly will benefit Trump this election (and harm Hillary), but we can only hope that the damage they’ve done is reversible. What do you all think? Isn’t it time for more of those representing us in Congress to denounce BLM as the terror group it is? Let us know in the comments and be sure to share this post on Facebook and Twitter. 
It does not matter anymore. The truth. Procedure. Commonsense. With all the hatred and immediate blame thrown on police officers for anything ranging from shootings to sneezes, it’s no wonder so many police departments are suffering with recruits. Who wants to be blamed for being a racist murderer when you are not one?  It just does not matter anymore. In this country, police are guilty until proven innocent in the eye of the public court of opinion. There have been police that have abused their power and those ones have been punished. But so many others along the way have been demonized by leftist media and terrorist activist groups like Black Lives Matter and the New Black Panthers. We can’t even agree as a people what is proper procedure for police. For instance, if you are told by police to stop moving, to stop moving your hands, to stop reaching your hands into places… is it then credible for an officer to use deadly force? BLM would say absolutely not. But why? Could a suspect be reaching for a gun? Yes. So many officers have been gunned down in exactly that type of scenario. Yet BLM and its followers demand that the officers talk their way out of situations like that. They demand that they use a taser. They demand that they shoot them in the leg. They demand a whole lot of stupid crap that they themselves would NEVER demand of themselves. What is justifiable self-defense to sane folks is straight out murder to others. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, another shooting by a white police officer has led to another black man’s death. The activists are out demanding justice…but when you ignore the orders of an officer, walk away from them back to your vehicle, then proceed to try and reach into your vehicle…what do you think the officers are thinking? Gun. That’s it. So, if you want to play dumb and ignore the warnings of cops, then your dumb ass deserves what’s coming.   A spokesman for the Tulsa, Oklahoma, Police Department says officers found PCP in the SUV of an unarmed black man who was shot dead by a white female cop last week. Sgt. Dave Walker told the Tulsa World investigators they recovered a vial of the drug in Terence Crutcher’s vehicle after he was gunned down by officer Betty Shelby. Police say Crutcher, 40, did not have a gun on him or in his vehicle. Video footage of the shooting also showed him walking toward his SUV with his hands in the air. Shelby’s attorney said Tuesday morning that his client had suspected Crutcher was high and opened fire after he reached through the window, perceiving it as a threat.

He says police tried to arrest him ‘for being black on a Friday.’ His phone told a different story… A Texas man pulled over on traffic violations says he was unfairly target by police and took it to Facebook Live video to capture his interaction with cops. But officers say he incriminated himself in footage of the incident, filming as he tried to hide drugs from police officers. Dominique Desha Green, 24, faces 11 charges, including drug possession, related to the Friday traffic stop in Dallas, the Dallas News reported. In the broadcast, Green says he was scrolling through his phone while at an AutoZone parking lot when an officer approached him.  He refused to talk to the first officer on scene, and insisted he talk to the sergeant, so he radioed in and they waited. While they waited, he continued live-streaming. He probably wishes he ha dn’t. ‘They’re just f***ing with me because I’m young, black — and on the wrong side of the neighborhood,’ Green said. A number of police officers can be seen in the video surrounding Green’s car. Near the video’s 10-minute mark, Green is heard doing something with the driver’s door, although the action is off-camera. Police says that’s when Green stashed cocaine in the driver’s side door. ‘I’m glad I didn’t get out of the car. I got a pocket full of all kind of s**t,’ he says in the video. Cops say they used that clue from the video to find the drugs. …officers found he had previously been convicted of marijuana possession and evading authorities by giving a false name, the Dallas News reported. He is seen in the video arguing with the cop who pulled him over, Officer Kristopher Trotter — and later spat on his face while being arrested, police said. Green also tried to kick out the window of the police car, and later continued at yell at the officer who arrested him. ..Police say Green also threatened to kill Officer Trotter and his wife, and to sexually assault his daughter. ‘When I get out I’m going to hunt you down,’ he said, according to the Dallas News. Green is being held at Dallas County Jail on $229,500 bail Daily Mail Such a charming young man. Why would anyone have it in for him? Share if this guy is a prime example of dumb criminals. 
Defending Donald Trump is no easy task, but even his most prominent campaign members are struggling to make sense of his behavior and comments. When MSNBCâs had campaign manager Kellyanne Conway on board to talk ahead of the Monday night debate between Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, Trumpâs righthand woman couldnât have been any more defensive and avoidant. In all honesty, she failed miserably to make her candidate look good, and choked under the pressure. Bloomberg Politics host Mark Halperin, who was also a guest on with Conway, asked the Trump campaign manager about Trump falsely accusing the debate moderator, NBCâs Lester Holt, of being a Democrat. He asked: âHe said Lester Holt was a Democrat. Lester Holt is a Republican. How could he say such a thing that just black-and white factually incorrect?â It was a fair question, and Conway wasnât ready for it. Her response was basically that Trump was not a liar; he just spoke without knowing the truth. Conway responded: âI donât know that he knew what Lester Holtâs voter registration is.â Halperin wasnât letting it go. He pressed Conway, repeating back to her what sheâd just said:Â âWithout knowing then, he asserted he was a Democrat?â Conway then tried to use one of her bossâ favorite interview tactics â dancing around questions. She fired back: âFirst of all, if you tell me the media are not overly populated with Democrats, thatâs false.â At this point, Halperin is getting frustrated and tries to keep Conway focused. He points out just exactly what was wrong in Trumpâs comments about Holt: âIâm asking about a very specific thing.Â He made a factual claim about the moderator who deserves the right to be treated fairly and it was just wrong. And itâs a metaphor for his frequently in public stating things with no basis, that are wrong.â Again, instead of responding, Conway began talking about the backlash NBCâs Matt Lauer received after being âtoo niceâ to Trump. It then becomes obvious that Mika Bzrezinki is also losing her patience, when she says, âThis is a filibusterâ while Conway rants on. Halperin once again tries to bring the conversation back: âYouâre not answering what I asked you.Â Iâm asking you how someone running for president can assert on the eve of the debate that the moderator is a Democrat, which is factually incorrect? How can he do that?â âHe shouldnât have assertedâ he didnât say, âI donât know what he is, but I think heâs biased,â he said heâs a Democrat.â Conway left this topic again to attack Hillary Clinton and the media, andÂ Brzezinski had to refocusÂ her by saying,Â âI donât understand what that has to do with Markâs question. We were asking why he lied about Lester Holt.â Conway finally says, âI donât think he liedâ andÂ Brzezinski corrected her,Â âUm, I think he did.â Conway then gave this moronic reply: âMika, a lie would mean he knew the manâs party registration.â Co-host Joe Scarborough had to cut the conversation short, but not before an exasperated Halperin could ask,Â âSo as president, would he say things that are false without knowing the truth?â You can watch the interview below: .@KellyannePolls: Trump âdidnât lieâ about Lester Holt, âa lie would mean that he knew the manâs party registrationâ https://t.co/dZWTCwpoim â Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) September 26, 2016  
When the Miami Dolphins have their first home game of the season Sept. 25 against the Cleveland Browns, they might not have their customary police escort to the stadium. After four Dolphins players refused to stand during the national anthem when it was played prior to their first game against the Seattle Seahawks, the police union in Miami called for a boycott, USA Today reports. Jeffery Bell, the president of the International Union of Police Associations, Local 6020, explained: We’ve asked the deputies and the Broward Sheriff’s Office not to do the details anymore. … I respect their right to have freedom of speech. However, in certain organizations and certain jobs you give up that right of your freedom of speech temporary while you serve that job or while you play in an NFL game. ... I can only imagine the public outcry if a group of police officers refused to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance or if we turned our back for the American flag for the national anthem. There would be a public outcry and internal affairs complaints a mile long on that. In response, Dolphins star running back Arian Foster replied: “They say it’s not time to do this. Then when is the time? It’s never the time in someone else’s eye.”  In addition to the Dolphins, various players for the New England Patriots, Kansas City Chiefs, and Seattle Seahawks have protested by either sitting or kneeling during the playing of the national anthem at their games. The protest movement began on Aug. 26 with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Despite the warning issued by Local 6020, three of the four protesting Dolphin players refused to stand when the anthem was played before the Sept. 18 game against the New England Patriots. Only linebacker Jelani Jenkins caved in and complied. Sources: Miami Herald, USA Today  / Photo credit: Miami Herald
NEW YORK (AP) — An Afghan immigrant wanted for questioning in the bombings that rocked a New York City neighborhood and a New Jersey shore town was taken into custody Monday after a shootout with police in New Jersey, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press. WABC-TV footage showed a man believed to be 28-year-old Ahmad Khan Rahami being loaded into an ambulance on a stretcher in Linden, New Jersey. He appeared to be conscious and looking around.  The law enforcement official, who was not authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity, said two officers were shot in the gun battle. The arrest came just hours after police issued a bulletin and photo of Rahami, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Afghanistan with an address in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Authorities said the blasts were looking increasingly like an act of terrorism with a foreign connection. Police did not disclose how they zeroed in on Rahami but were known to be poring over surveillance video. At the same time, five people who were pulled over in a vehicle Sunday night were being questioned by the FBI, officials said. The shootout came after a weekend of fear and dread in New York and New Jersey. Video shows bombing suspect Ahmad Rahami in custody in Linden, New Jersey. pic.twitter.com/NrVJCPNAkC — Eyewitness News (@ABC7NY) September 19, 2016  In addition to the blast that injured 29 people in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood on Saturday, an unexploded pressure cooker bomb was found blocks away, and a pipe bomb exploded in a New Jersey shore town before a charity race. No one was injured there. On Sunday, five explosive devices were discovered in a trash can at an Elizabeth train station. Also on Saturday, a man who authorities say referred to Allah wounded nine people in a stabbing rampage at a Minnesota mall before being shot to death by an off-duty police officer. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility. Authorities have not drawn any connection between the violence in Minnesota and the bombings in the New York area. Citing the FBI, New Jersey State Police said Monday that the bombings in Chelsea and the New Jersey shore town Seaside Park were connected. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said as investigators gathered information, they learned there were “certain commonalities among the bombs,” leading authorities to believe “that there was a common group behind the bombs.” Before Rahami’s capture, Cuomo said investigators have no reason to believe there are further threats, but the public should “be on constant guard.” Early Monday, FBI agents swarmed an apartment above a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth that is tied to Rahami. The Rahami family lives in the apartment. The restaurant, First American Fried Chicken, is owned by Rahami’s father and has also employed some of his brothers, Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage said. He said Rahami’s father and two brothers sued the city after it passed an ordinance requiring the restaurant to close early because of complaints from neighbors about it being a late-night nuisance. Ryan McCann, of Elizabeth, said that he often ate at the restaurant and recently began seeing Rahami working there more. “He’s always in there. He’s a very friendly guy, that’s what’s so scary. It’s hard when it’s home,” McCann said. In the immediate aftermath of the New York bombing, de New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Cuomo were careful to say there was no evidence of a link to international terrorism. Both said Monday that appeared to be changing. “The more we learn with each passing hour is it looks more like terrorism,” de Blasio said in an interview on NY1 News. Cuomo said on MSNBC: “Today’s information suggests it may be foreign-related, but we’ll see where it goes.” On Sunday night, FBI agents in Brooklyn stopped “a vehicle of interest” in the investigation of the Manhattan explosion, according to FBI spokeswoman Kelly Langmesser. She wouldn’t provide further details, but a government official and a law enforcement official who were briefed on the investigation told The Associated Press that five people in the car were being questioned at an FBI building in Manhattan. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about the investigation. On Sunday, a federal law enforcement official said the Chelsea bomb contained a residue of Tannerite, an explosive often used for target practice that can be picked up in many sporting goods stores. Cellphones were discovered at the site of both the New York and New Jersey bombings, but no Tannerite residue was identified in the New Jersey bomb remnants, in which a black powder was detected, said the official, who wasn’t authorized to comment on the investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. The pipe bomb that exploded Saturday in Seaside Park went off before a charity 5K race to benefit Marines and sailors. The race was canceled. One of the five devices found at the Elizabeth train station exploded while a bomb squad robot tried to disarm it. No one was hurt. 
One of the greatest progressive liberals of our time is Senator Elizabeth Warren. She is notably good friends with Senator Bernie Sanders. However, she is most known for her blatant lie about having Native American ancestry. Which she used in order to gain scholarships and wrote down in numerous collegiate and professional books to take advantage of minority support groups. Conservatives will never let her live it down and justifiably so. A college student confronted her at an event where he took a video of her and when he confronted her about lying about her ethnicity she literally ran away. Like a kid who got their hand caught in the cookie jar. Watch here,  They were both at an event at Ohio State University where Warren was campaigning wits Democratic Senate candidate Ted Strickland for Hillary Clinton. They called for people to vote for Hillary Clinton and partake in voting on the state level but to also build a Senate dominated by Democrats. The young student confronted Warren about losing big to Donald Trump to which she retorted they weren’t. But that was not enough for the young man. When Warren insisted they were going to beat Trump the student yelled to her that she lied about her ethnicity to get a scholarship. You could see the smoke behind her she ran away so fast. As the saying goes, if you want to upset a conservative them lie to the, but if you want to hurt a liberal then tell them the truth. Donald Trump got flack in the press for calling her out on the same thing too. He referenced her when he called her Pochahontas. An obvious sarcastic jab at her previous deception about her ethnicity. But you reap what you sew and what goes around comes around. The best part is they aren’t lying, they’re telling the truth. Warren lied and she can run but she certainly cannot hide from that. 
Secretary of State John Kerry said at the Global Fishing Watch reception in D.C. that there is a small group of Americans who block every government action on global warming, because they think that once the ice caps melt – still waiting for that to happen – all that extra water will just “spill over the sides of a flat earth.”  Manmade global warming proponents are always comparing those who disagree with them to “flat-earthers.” The idea that there was a time when Christians and other “uneducated” people believed that the Earth was flat is a complete myth. That myth was promulgated largely by Darwinists in the latter part of the 19th century as a way to discredit Creationists. There wasn’t ever a time when the consensus among Christians was that the Earth was flat. This lie was perpetuated to show that Christians held to their “religious dogma” in spite of evidence discovered by “brave” and “objective” scientists who were persecuted by Christians for their discovery. So in reality, opponents of Columbus’s voyage didn’t actually say that they were concerned he might fall off the edge of the Earth. Their concern was mostly about how far he would be going in unknown territory and how much it would cost to finance such an expedition. What we do see throughout history is that the establishment of any particular field of study – whether it be science or medicine – is usually the group that holds fast to its theories in spite of new evidence and findings that might show the establishment to be in error. They hold on to their theories for political and financial reasons. They use their own clout to silence and/or ridicule those who threaten the status quo that they’ve created for themselves. And that’s just what the whole anthropogenic global warming myth is all about. They want to maintain their theories so they can benefit politically and financially from them. They can twist the scientific data to make it say whatever they want. And any scientist who tries to expose them for trying to cram inflated data inside a pre-formulated theory is ignored or discredited. We all know how an establishment treats whistleblowers.

If there is one thing you can say about Trump supporters, it is that they are sure about what they don’t know. And what they don’t know can fill volumes, as evidenced by the latest conversation with some of them, shared on the September 20 episode of Comedy Central’s The Daily Show. You can’t blame these people for some of the conspiracy theories they believe — many of those theories started in right-wing media, like Fox News. But when asked, many Trump voters were willing to offer up their own ideas about conspiracies that go far and beyond what even Sean Hannity would probably touch. Reporter Jordan Klepper visited Trump rallies to talk to the attendees and what they told him will make you laugh at first –then it just might make you cry. Trump famously said that he loves the “poorly educated” and Klepper found them in abundance as they waited to hear from their god-emperor. The first couple of people Klepper talks to were interested in rumors about Hillary’s health. One man tells him that he thinks she has AIDS, which she got from Bill. And where did Bill get it? “From messing with that Magic Johnson,” the man replies. We assume he meant the former NBA star and not the ex-president’s, er, “johnson.” It doesn’t take Klepper long to find people who appear to be totally divorced from reality. Like the man who believes Clinton has a body double, and when shown two identical photos of the candidate by Klepper, he quickly and confidently picks out the one he thinks is the “double.” Then there’s the guy who says President Obama reveals he is a Muslim by the way he wears his jewelry. He is referring to a long debunked story that claimed that the president stopped wearing his watch and wedding ring in observance of Ramadan. But there’s no restriction prohibiting Muslims from wearing jewelry during the holy month, except in this man’s mind. So the president appearing sans watch and wedding ring proves absolutely nothing. But the winner is the guy who claimed that Hillary has AIDS, for his demand to know why President Obama wasn’t in the Oval Office when the World Trade Center was attacked on September 11, 2001. These people will be voting on November 8. Will you be? Here’s the video, via Comedy Central: Featured image via Comedy Central screen capture  Here’s another “passionate” supporter of Donald Trump in action: according to police, he was building a bomb to use against Muslims.
Police say Keith Lamont Scott had a gun. Scottâs family says he was just reading a book. But it doesnât matter what the facts are, racists are not only happy that another black man is dead, but theyalso want police to kill all of the people protesting the shooting. Protests broke out in Charlotte, North Carolina on Tuesday night and, as usual, Fox News went to great lengths to portray the protest as a full scale riot and that sent racists into a hateful frenzy on Twitter.

These are the people who are going to be voting in November for Donald Trump, who has the backing of white supremacist groups. While some people are wrongly taking advantage of the protests to riot, itâs also wrong to call black people âanimalsâ or âsavagesâ or the N-word. Tensions are already high enough as it is. Adding this kind of racism to the mix wonât help settle things down. 
Over 375 of the world’s leading scientific minds published an open letter on Tuesday warning America about the dangers that a Donald Trump presidency presents to the environment. The Republican nominee, who believes that global warming is a hoax created by the Chinese, has stated his intention to pull out of the historic Paris climate change treaty that President Obama signed a few months ago with all 194 other countries in the world. That agreement, expected to be implemented by at least 61 of the world’s worst polluters (accounting for 47% of all emissions), is set to be ratified by the end of the year. The letter, signed by such notable names as Stephen Hawking and over 30 Nobel laureates, paints a bleak picture for our nation if Trump is elected and reneges on our international climate treaty obligations. From studies of changes in temperature and sea level over the last million years, we know that the climate system has tipping points. Our proximity to these tipping points is uncertain. We know, however, that rapid warming of the planet increases the risk of crossing climatic points of no return, possibly setting in motion large-scale ocean circulation changes, the loss of major ice sheets, and species extinctions. The climatic consequences of exceeding such thresholds are not confined to the next one or two electoral cycles. They have lifetimes of many thousands of years. The political system also has tipping points. Thus it is of great concern that the Republican nominee for President has advocated U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Accord. A “Parexit” would send a clear signal to the rest of the world: “The United States does not care about the global problem of human-caused climate change. You are on your own.” Such a decision would make it far more difficult to develop effective global strategies for mitigating and adapting to climate change. The consequences of opting out of the global community would be severe and long-lasting – for our planet’s climate and for the international credibility of the United States. The United States can and must be a major player in developing innovative solutions to the problem of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. Nations that find innovative ways of decarbonizing energy systems and sequestering CO2 will be the economic leaders of the 21st century. Walking away from Paris makes it less likely that the U.S. will have a global leadership role, politically, economically, or morally. We cannot afford to cross that tipping point. Donald Trump, in a nod to the fossil fuel oligarchs that pull the strings of the Republican Party, complains that the Paris Agreement “gives foreign bureaucrats control over how much energy we use right here in America.” That assertion is of course ludicrous; under the Paris Climate Agreement, each country develops its own plan; while countries openly share their progress towards their emission reduction targets with each other, no country can tell another what to do. But what Trump is really defending is the ability of multinational energy companies to extract every last ounce of value out the environment and reap as much profit as they can before the consequences of their pyromaniacal carbon frenzy catches up to them. They know the end of their gravy train is coming soon – but if they succeed, it will be far too late for the rest of us. Anyone with half a brain can see that month after month brings the highest temperatures ever recorded. Only a fool would refuse to acknowledge how storms hit with more fury than they did before; that droughts are longer and wildfires deadlier. Natural disasters will increase in intensity and frequency if we continue to pollute as quickly as we do. The wrath of Gaia is the biggest threat facing the human race – and we must confront it head on if we want human civilization to survive as we know it. Electing Donald Trump would be the absolute worst thing that we could do for our nation and for the world as a whole. You can read the full letter here.  
The shooter responsible for injuring nine people during a mass shooting in Houston on Monday was wearing Nazi paraphernalia, according to the Houston Police Department. Two sources from within law enforcement have confirmed to  that the body of the shooter – who was fatally shot by police during the shootings – was wearing a World War II German uniform covered in swastikas. While his name has yet to be officially confirmed by police, media outlets have discovered that the shooter’s vehicle was owned by a 46-year-old attorney by the name of Nathan Desai. Two of his nine victims are listed as being in critical condition, and six of the remaining seven have been released from the hospital. Desai was a lawyer who practiced in Houston who had recently fallen into hard times financially. “He was worried … because his law practice was not running good, so he (was) worried about this all the time,” the Desai’s Father said. Additional Nazi paraphernalia as well as extra weapons were also found in his car and residence. Houston Police have not yet given an official ruling about whether the shooting will be labelled as an act of terrorism.        
Supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump were not pleased when Rina Shah appeared on Fox News for Independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin last Friday, September 16, 2016. And one of them left a hateful, racist voice mail for her at McMullin’s campaign office. Ms. Shah and the McMullin campaign turned this awful-tasting lemon into lemonade – in the form of a campaign ad. Evan McMullin was a Republican. At the beginning of August, he announced his Independent candidacy for president as an alternative to Republican nominee Donald Trump. Rina Shah is a political and media consultant who joined McMullin’s campaign staff as Communications Director in mid-August 2016. Shah was born in West Virginia to Indian American parents.  She has been a commentator on the PBS program “To the Contrary” and she founded Rilax Strategies, a political consulting firm. Shah said to BuzzFeed that this wasn’t the first time she’s received such messages: “I could send you, I’m not kidding, hundreds of emails I’ve received … You know, ‘You’re a Muslim,’ ‘You’re a C-U-N-T’ — I get a lot of, ‘Go back to your country.’” The caller identified himself only as “Alan.” BuzzFeed tracked him down and learned that his name is Alan Pryce. Once the transcript of the message was read to him, Pryce claimed it and said he: “…Stands by every word.”   Mr. Pryce seems to have the same loose relationship with the truth as the candidate he supports. He did not know, for example, that Ms. Shah was born in the United States. His reaction: “Really? Well, she’s absolutely a first-gen whatever. Look, I didn’t do a biography on her.” He continued: “Clearly, she’s an anti-American supporter of a pathological, lying criminal. Anyone who supports [Hillary Clinton], either actively or tacitly, is anti-American scum in my mind.” BuzzFeed reported that Pryce says he was disabled by an undocumented immigrant. He would not give any details, so BuzzFeed could not confirm his story. Pryce had some choice words for McMullin, too (“cuckservative,” which is straight from the alt-right‘s racist playbook). But he doesn’t mind at all being part of the McMullin campaign’s ad. He thinks it’s “hysterical.” Watch the ad with Alan’s message, but be warned that it’s language is quite graphic:  Featured Image: Screenshot Via YouTube Video.
It’s night-impossible to spend five minutes in a Fox News comment thread without coming across something that would give even a Klansman pause to say “hey man, can you tone it down? That’s a bit too racist.” But buried within the Stupid Part of America’s criticisms of a kind, 6-year-old New York boy who wrote to President Obama to ask if a little Syrian boy  who was rescued from a building that had been hit by an airstike was a comment from one of Trump’s “deplorables” that explains why conservatives are the way they are.   “Dear President Obama. Remember the boy who was picked up by the ambulance in Syria?” the boy, Alex, read in a video posted by the White House. “Can you please go get him and bring him to our home? Park in the driveway or on the streets and we’ll be waiting for you guys with flags, flowers and balloons.” “We will give him a family and he will be our brother,” Alex says. “Catherine, my little sister, will be collecting butterflies and fireflies for him. “We can invite him to birthday parties and he will teach us another language … And I will share my bike and I will teach him how to ride it. I will teach him additions and subtractions in math.” “These are the words of a six-year-old boy — a young child who has not learned to be cynical or suspicious or fearful of other people because of where they come from, how they look, or how they pray,” Obama wrote on his Facebook page, adding “we should all be more like Alex.” It’s a beautiful story – one of hope and pure love that all of us should feel fortunate just to be aware of.  Naturally, conservatives had to sh*t all over it:  You might be wondering how a group of people can be so racist and…deplorable. Fortunately, one of them hopped out of the basket to inform you. “What’s wrong with being a racist?” one commenter calling himself “VarnstarkBittlewater” asks when someone remarks that the comments got quite, quite racist. Another person, “pdubya,” replies “everyone is” to which Mr. Bittlewater responds, “my point exactly.”  In case you missed it, conservatives genuinely believe everyone — black, white, polka-dot — is a racist at his or her core, and that this excuses their racism. After all, “if everyone is doing it…” You can watch the video below. At least you’ll appreciate how awesome it is:  Featured image via screengrab
Jason Falconer, the NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, who shot the ISIS terrorist who stabbed eight people in St. Cloud, Minnesota, is someone that Hillary Clinton wants to put out of business. In fact, it’s one of the primary things she intends to do first if she is elected president. This is a brave man who saved countless lives by taking out a Jihadist. The same kind of Islamic refugee that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton just love to death. Falconer owns Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. which is one of those businesses that Clinton just despises… because it has to do with guns, training people how to safely use weapons and is a protector and promoter of our Second Amendment rights. This is one of the biggest reasons not to ever vote for Hillary Clinton… EVER. From Bearing Arms: We told you this morning how USPSA Shooter, 3-Gunner, and NRA-certified firearms instructor Jason Falconer shot and killed a 22-year-old Somali immigrant who went on a stabbing rampage inside a St. Cloud, (MN) Mall on Saturday, saving countless lives. What we didn’t tell you is that Hillary Clinton wants to bankrupt Falconer, driving him out of the business of saving lives. Falconer is the president and owner of Tactical Advantage, LLC and Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. His business interests all revolve around training law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms for self-defense to protect themselves and loved ones from criminal predators (and apparently terrorists). If elected President, Hillary Clinton will do everything in her power to see Jason Falconer driven out of business and into bankruptcy. Falconer’s Tactical Advantage, LCC, is a full-service training facility with a firing range, gun rentals, firearms training and gun sales to law-abiding citizens. It is American as apple pie and one that I love. The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) provides limited legal protection to businesses such as Falconer’s to protect them from frivolous lawsuits that would take them under. Clinton wants to do away with PLCAA, removing that protection and exposing the business to radical lawfare. Clinton repeatedly and falsely claims that PLCAA offers gunmakers and dealers “immunity.” It’s an outrageous falsehood and is vintage Clinton. She hates the Second Amendment and will do all she can to quash and eliminate it. She is the single biggest threat to our right to bear arms we have ever faced as a nation. Jason Falconer has spent his entire life protecting his fellow citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and then when concealed carry became legal in Minnesota, he took the initiative to create a firearms training company and then a range and retail shop in order to provide the best possible self-defense training to others that he could. Hillary Clinton wants to take that away and destroy all of it. The fact that he took down an Islamic extremist probably makes her hate him all the more. Just say no to Hillary Clinton, so heroes like Falconer are celebrated, not punished.  
Trumpâs Campaign Manager was interrupted on CNN by Anderson Cooper after she said, âyouâve got all these little baby girls being killed just because theyâre girls in this country.â Without letting her finish, Anderson immediately stopped her: âWait, what Excuse me, where is that happening?â She then went on and tried to back up her statement by citing Planned Parenthood data, which was supposedly collected by the Guttmacher Institute report. But, Anderson Cooper wasnât buying it. âBut statistically, thereâs not really much evidence that that is actually occurring in the United States,â Cooper said. âAmongst some immigrant groups in small numbers it may be occurring but in no statistical measure is it significant.â Then â right after commercial break â Anderson Cooper again came back in order to set the record straight. The only thing Trumpâs campaign manager could do was force a fakeÂ smile. âBefore the break, Kellyanne, you mentioned the Guttmacher Institute information on sex-selective abortion in the United States,â Cooper said. âHereâs what they actually say in a May 30 press release titled âSex Selective Abortion Bans: A Disingenuous New Strategy to Limit Womenâs Access to Abortion.ââ âThe study acknowledges the practice does go on overseas, as we mentioned, and perhaps in certain Asian-American communities in the United States in small numbers,â Copper continued. âBut, quote, âIn the United States, meanwhile, there is limited data indicating that sex-selective abortion may be occurring in some Asian communities. Although the U.S. sex ratio at 1.05 males for every female is squarely within biologically normal parameters.â So I just wanted to put that out there.â 
I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed: Hereâs Google:  Naturally, my reaction was âoh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wifeâs campaign now?â Of course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people donât do, to find out the real story â and the real story is that there is no pay to play. âIt was natural for people whoâve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldnât do anything they shouldnât do,â Clinton toldÂ NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning.Â  Source: CNN In other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesnât mean theyâll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but thereâs no evidence they got them. Now, letâs talk about the foundation the media doesnât like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasnât given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trumpâs charitable foundation over concerns that it âengaged in some improprietyâ as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled othersâ contributions âto make them appear to have come from himâ although he âhasnât given to the foundation since 2008.â Source: Media Matters Media Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clintonâs candidacy: Journalists have been criticized for the âdouble standardâ in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clintonâs pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Postâs reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trumpâs Dr. Oz stunt. All of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton âscandalâ (if you call getting sick a âscandalâ) while ignoring every scandal in Trumpâs closet, and trust me, there are a lot. 
There may be a few women out there who enjoy a man telling them to be more joyous in their presence, but as for the rest of us, thereâs nothing a woman hates more than being told to smile. Do men smile all the time? No. Because if they did, weâd think they were crazy and up to something. Same goes for women. Not every situation calls for a smile at all times. Especially when discussing foreign policy and our military. So, when RNC Chair Reince Priebus thought it appropriate to criticize Hillary Clinton for not smiling enough during the NBC forum hosted by Matt Lauer, it didnât exactly go over well. One person who definitely had a lot to say about Priebus and his request of a smile from Hillary was none other than Chelsea Handler on her hit Netflix show . Chelsea began by asking Priebus: âWho the f*ck are you to tell someone to smile?â Adding: âThis is just another example of how men feel the can belittle every woman in the world and order up a smile.â Chelsea then said: âStop telling women to smile. We donât like that. Itâs not an icebreaker, itâs a deal breaker.â Going for Priebusâ jugular, Chelsea absolutelyÂ destroys him and his ridiculously corny smile, then says: âYou know when women will smile? When Hillary kicks that pneumoniaÂ and trounces Trump in November.â And thatâs exactly right. Watch the full video here:  
It’s no secret that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie would like to be part of a Trump administration, probably in the role of Attorney General. But he may have to do it from prison if prosecutors are able to prove what they alleged in court today. The New York Times reports that prosecutors in the “Bridgegate” trial of former Christie associates Bridget Anne Kelly and Bill Baroni said during opening statements on Monday morning that Christie was aware of what was going on as it was happening. Defense attorneys for Kelly and Baroni had also previously claimed that Christie was aware of the supposed “traffic study” that was taking place at the Fort Lee, New Jersey entrance to the George Washington Bridge, but this is the first time prosecutors have publicly agreed with them. Prosecutors said that Baroni and David Wildstein, both alleged conspirators in the case, had bragged to Christie about the chaos being created by the lane closings, and how they had created the bogus traffic study to mess with the mayor of Fort Lee, a Democrat who had balked at endorsing Christie’s re-election bid. But prosecutor Vikas Khanna, also told the jury that they should not wonder why “others” weren’t charged in the case. Christie has denied knowing about what Baroni and Wildstein allegedly did until months later. But Khanna told the jury that the governor was informed at a September 11 memorial service in 2013, three days after the lane closures started, while they were still going on: “The evidence will show that Baroni and Wildstein were so committed to their plan to punish mayor Sokolich during those few minutes they had alone with the Governor they bragged about the fact there were traffic problems in Fort Lee and Mayor Sokolich was not getting his calls returned.” Wildstein, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in the case last year, is now the government’s star witness. Attorneys for Baroni and Kelly described him as Christie’s puppet. Baroni’s attorney, Michael Baldassare, said, “When David Wildstein spoke governor Christie’s voice came out and everybody knew it.” There is still no evidence that Christie knew or approved of the scheme ahead of time. But if prosecutors can prove that the governor did indeed know what was happening while it was still going on, and did nothing to stop it, it could cause serious problems for his barely concealed aspirations to be a member of Trump’s cabinet. Of course, with any luck there won’t be a Trump cabinet for him to be a member of. Featured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images  Trump told us EXACTLY who he will favor as president.
According to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they don’t end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities. Case in point. The specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and a child’s genitals, so if you’re a parent of a child and you’ve changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, you’re a felon. For real. This is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from “intentionally or knowingly touching” the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don’t know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids. The AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that “prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.” They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right? In others words, just trust the prosecutors, y’all. There’s no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them. Wow. There are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But here’s an especially interesting tidbit: As Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority’s logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court’s help, Arizona’s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver—out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state’s residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona’s parents and caregivers. Yikes. But I’m sure it’ll all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, y’all. Because doesn’t government always know best?
Following the presidential debate, Donald Trump campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson opened her mouth on CBS and stupidity just flowed out of it. Pierson was on the show to discuss Donald Trump’s debate performance on Monday. When Trump wasn’t sniffling, he was interrupting Hillary Clinton. Naturally, Pierson blamed Hillary Clinton for Donald Trump touting the stop-and-frisk policy, which by the way, was ruled unconstitutional in 2013. During the post-debate panel, Pierson was asked to comment on Donald Trump’s recent proposal to get more cities to adopt the kind of stop-and-frisk policy in New York that was found unconstitutional back in 2013. As a shock to no one ever, Rudy Giuliani, a huge Trump supporter, is and was a proponent of the racist policy. Pierson took another route and blamed Clinton, because of course: “In responding, Pierson said that stop-and-frisk was effective at stopping crime and was not really racist — but then she blamed Hillary Clinton for stop-and-frisk being necessary because of her own racism.” “It actually did work in New York,” Pierson said of the stop-and-frisk policy. “But we have to get down to why, because that’s why we’re here today. We have two candidates who have very different views. The reason why we have this problem, the reason why stop-and-frisk was implemented, was there were disparities with regard to who people were pulling over,” she continued. She went on to say: “And it’s profiling, criminal profiling, not necessarily racial profiling, even though it comes across that way. But the reason why we had it was that we had the First Lady of the United States who went out on the national stage and dehumanized young black children… this has been the conditioning of the American public where black children have been demonized, Hillary Clinton owns that.” Watch:  In late August, Trump tweeted, “How quickly people forget that Crooked Hillary called African-American youth “SUPER PREDATORS” – Has she apologized?” Yes, Hillary Clinton made the “super predators” remark more than 20 years ago, but it was not directed toward African-American children. This is nothing new for Pierson. Just last month, she blamed President Obama for Iraq war deaths in 2004. 
The police officer who shot unarmed motorist Terence Crutcher has been charged with first-degree manslaughter and a warrant has been issued for her arrest. Crutcher had been driving home from community college when his SUV broke down. Officer Betty Shelby, who has a past history of domestic violence and drug abuse, was on her way to answer a domestic dispute when she encountered Crutcher and the SUV. She stopped, initiated the confrontation with Crutcher, and shot him dead, even though he clearly has his hands up and was unarmed. Her radio communications show that she called him a “bad dude” even though there was no reason to do so. While the charges are a good sign that justice will be carried out, we must remember that not a single police officer was convicted of unlawfully killing a civilian last year. Nor were any convicted in 2014. Since 2005, only thirteen cops have been brought to justice for executing civilians. “Juries and judges seem reluctant to second-guess the split-second life or death decisions of police officers in violent street encounters in the course of their job … and will give the benefit of every doubt to an officer on trial in these cases” says criminology professor Phillip Stintson.   We’d appreciate it if they began to give the people they ostensibly are “protecting and serving” the same benefit of the doubt. Here is video of the shooting. Viewer discretion is advised; as Police Chief Chuck Jordan remarked, “it is very disturbing.”
Man, at this rate I’m going to run out of places to shop. Walmart proved and admitted they have cop-hating asshats working for them. This one happened in Georgia… the daughter of an officer who is retiring went to get him a cake. On it, it said ‘Blue Lives Matter’ with a think blue line on a black background. What the hell is racist about that? Three workers (who should all be fired) refused to decorate the cake for the retirement party. These morons don’t seem to actually know the definition of ‘racist’. What’s worse is Walmart admits this happened. This officer served faithfully on the force, risking his life every day for 25 years. And these mush heads decided that they were too offended to do a cake for a police officer. “One of the bakers told me the design could be perceived as racist and nobody feels comfortable decorating the cake,” the police officer’s daughter said. Then they should not be working there. Shame on Walmart for not firing these three cop-haters. From Todd Starnes: Three Walmart workers in McDonough, Georgia refused to decorate a “thin blue line” cake for a police officer’s retirement party because they said it was racist. A number of my Georgia readers alerted me to the story and on Saturday night I spoke directly with the police officer’s daughter. She asked that I not divulge her name and I’ve agreed to honor her request. “I was so shocked,” she told me. “I didn’t know what to do or say or anything. I was trying not to lose my temper or make a scene.” “The baker told me the blue line cake was racist” — POLICE OFFICER’S DAUGHTER “I just wanted to make my dad a cake to show how much i appreciated him.” As an alternative, the officer’s daughter suggested a chocolate-frosted cake with a horizontal, frosted blue line. But that design was also rejected by Walmart’s cake decorator. “She said, ‘I don’t feel comfortable doing this,’” the cop’s daughter said. “I asked her, ‘Is there something wrong with cops?’” After being rejected for a third time, the 21 year-old told the bakers, “I’ll find another bakery, thank you.” That Walmart should be boycotted. It’s in McDonough, Georgia on Willow Drive for those of you who would like to let them know how you feel about this outrageous behavior. The officer’s daughter was far more polite than I would have been. I would have gladly made a huge, ongoing scene and then I would have called the media. Then I would have gone to social media with it. I would have shamed them to hell and back. “I was disappointed,” she told me. “I go to Walmart all the time — at least once a week spend hundreds of dollars. I just wanted to make my dad a cake to show how much I appreciated him.” This just pisses me off. A friend of the family did indeed put this on Facebook and what do you know… management called the police officer’s wife and daughter and apologized. Sort of. “He said he was so sorry,” the daughter said. “He offered to make the cake free of charge and he gave me a $50 gift card.” Walmart confirmed the story, but they did not admit their employees called the cake racist. Only that the employee made a ‘mistake’. Damn right they did… I’d still boycott them. Now, for the cherry on this cake. The manager offered to make and decorate a new cake. But there was just one problem — the cake decorators refused to comply. “So the manager told me that he would decorate it — but it looked terrible,” the police officer’s daughter said. “It doesn’t look professional.” In the end, the daughter did not have time to get a cake after all this. Walmart should be ashamed. “It irritates me that in Charlotte, North Carolina, the Walmart was looted and the cops were protecting them,” she said. “And you can’t make a cake for the people who are protecting you?” Walmart has hired a bunch of low class, anti-cop bigots. They need to be fired and Walmart needs to make this right.  
Weâve all seen the horrific photos of children who are victims of the Syrian Civil War. Perhaps the most infamous is the one of the little boy sitting, covered in blood and dirt, barefoot, in the back of an ambulance. He is clearly in shock. It shows us just what that kind of war does to a society, to ordinary people, and children just like us, just like the kids in our own lives. via Mirror.co.UK Well, there is one person who is completely unmoved by these images: Donald Trump Jr. The Donaldâs mini me has long shown his lack of humanity. After all, he made a disgusting Holocaust reference when trying to tear down the mediaâs coverage of Hillary Clinton, saying if the GOP did what the Democrats are doing, theyâd be âwarming up the gas chamber.â Well, now, heâs gone into the gutter again, this time regarding Syrian refugees. Trump Jr sent out the following tweet, comparing refugees to a bowl of Skittles: This image says it all. Let's end the politically correct agenda that doesn't put America first. #trump2016 pic.twitter.com/9fHwog7ssN â Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) September 19, 2016  And as if this werenât bad enough, comparing human beings to a bowl of candy, this is actually a white supremacist meme. The Skittles are a reference to white supremacist meme. Changed from M&Ms to Skittles because of George Zimmerman. https://t.co/86FsWdft5O â Laura Seay (@texasinafrica) September 20, 2016  George Zimmerman is, of course, the wannabe cop who got away with murdering Trayvon Martin, a black teen who was walking home from the store in Florida with only a can of iced tea and a package of skittles. So, in other words, once again, Trump Jr. is openly courting white supremacists on his fatherâs behalf. Skittles spokeswoman Denise Young said that her company, Wrigley, which is the parent company that produces skittles, didnât believe Trump Jrâs image was âappropriate.â She went on to say: âSkittles are candy. Refugees are people. We donât feel itâs an appropriate analogy. We will respectfully refrain from further commentary as anything we say could be misinterpreted as marketing.â The Trump campaign is so repugnant that even candy makers have to speak out. This meme is racist, disgusting, and is just another sign of what a morally bankrupt family the Trumps are. Do everything you can to keep them out of the White House, folks. VOTE BLUE. 
A devastating crime happened this weekend in Baltimore but it’s being totally ignored by the press and Black Lives Matter because the shooter was a criminal not a Police Officer. Outside some rowhouses about 8:30 p.m on Saturday a handful of people were shot. Investigators say the shooting was a premeditated act of revenge in response to a Labor Day weekend shooting in which a man was fatally shot and two women were wounded, one of them pregnant. Although the victims may have recognized the gunmen, authorities haven’t immediately been able to identify the suspects. Attackers had a shotgun and two handguns. One of the armed men emerged from an alley and the others ran down the street and opened fire just in front of the victims. The surprised victims were a 3-year-old girl, a woman and a half dozen men. While the the 3-year-old girl and her father were standing a slight distance away from the others and that the child was not an intended target but got hit anyway. By then, most signs of the attack had been cleared away. There was a bullet hole through the rear window of a car parked on the block. Neighbors sat quietly on their steps. Few wanted to talk about the attack. “They’re scared,” said a woman, who declined to be identified. “They ain’t talking too much.” So far there have been 240 killings in Baltimore and it appears to be from gang activity. On Sunday there were 4 other shootings and an 8-year-old boy was injured adding to the city’s mayhem. I guess the question is; where are the riots? Where are Black Lives Matter? Do they not really care about violence against minorities unless it’s from a Police Officer? Sadly, black on black crime is the biggest tragedy happening to minorities and yet Black lives Matter remains silent. Below are some statistic showing the hypocrisy of BLM: ⦁While only 6% of the U.S. population is identified as black and male, 57.9% of the persons legally killed by a private citizen in self-defense were black males. ⦁ However, 73.1% of the black males legally killed by a citizen in self-defense between 2009-2012 were killed by a black citizen. ⦁ 42.6% of victims of all solved criminal homicides from 2009-2012 were black males ⦁ 89.6% of black males killed in criminal homicides from 2009-2012 were killed by another black male ⦁ 40.6% of the police officers murdered in the line of duty from 2009-2012 were killed by black males* And while black people continue to kill black people en masse, it’s harder to get killed by a police officer if you’re black than getting hit by lightening. 
Throughout much of the presidential campaign season, the health status of Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has been a hot topic of discussion, largely owing to her several coughing fits and episodes of bizarre behavior, culminating in her near faint and collapse at the 9/11 memorial service a couple of weeks ago. Her health issues were likely a top concern of her campaign headed into the first presidential debate at Hofstra University on Monday, as the presidential debate commission just released clarifications on debate rules that could conceivably work against Clinton. According to the Drudge Report, an unnamed source within the commission revealed that there would be no breaks during the scheduled 90-minute debate, even if Clinton suffers a coughing fit or some other minor medical issue while on stage. “There are no commercial breaks,” the source stated. “Period.” Furthermore, moderator Lester Holt of NBC has zero authority to make cameras cut away from the stage or manipulate the audio microphones in any way, meaning Clinton will have no place to hide from the eyes of potentially 100 million viewers (and voters) if she does suffer some sort of medical episode during the debate. In related news, the debate commission also shot down a request by Clinton’s campaign for a step stool that she could stand on during the debate to help compensate for the immense size difference between her and her Republican rival Donald Trump. Clinton is believed to stand approximately 5’4″ tall, nearly a foot shorter than the 6’2″ Trump, who will no doubt appear dominating in comparison. However, the commission was willing to provide Clinton with a custom-built podium specifically for her that should help to accommodate the obvious size difference between the two candidates. Clinton’s campaign may look at loading up their candidate with whatever drugs they are feeding her on a regular basis to prevent another coughing fit or dizzy spell on stage that would likely ruin any chance she still retains of winning the election. Please share this on Facebook and Twitter to spread the word that the presidential debate will have no commercial breaks or stoppages for Clinton to hide, rest or recover if she happens to suffer another coughing fit or medical episode on stage. What do you think of the debate commission ruling that there will be no breaks during the debate? Scroll down to comment below!
Hillary Clinton, former, Secretary of State, has stuck to her story that she handed over all of her work-related emails. Even though, she wiped her computer with the equivalent of electronic bleach, not a simple cloth, yeah…she has absolutely nothing to hide! The best part, Hillary holds fast to her claim, even as new batches of emails are recovered. Emails, that were not included in her alleged “complete” batch, she’d originally turned over. Now, 30 emails that had been previously wiped off the face of the earth, were recovered. Unfortunately for Hillary, they were related to Benghazi, but she knew that didn’t she?  FBI investigators recovered 30 emails from Hillary Clintonâs wiped server which discussed Benghazi, government lawyers said in federal court on Tuesday. The disclosure was made during a hearing before U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta in a case involving a lawsuit filed by the watchdog group Judicial Watch. Government lawyers told U.S. District Court Judge Amit P. Mehta Tuesday that an undetermined number of the emails among the 30 were not included in the 55,000 pages previously provided by Clinton to State. The agency said it would need until the end of September to review the emails and redact potentially classified information before they are released. Government lawyers revealed in a court filing last week that some of the emails recovered by FBI investigators from her email server contained âsearch termsâ related to Benghazi. Clinton gave the State Department more than 30,000 of her work-related emails in Dec. 2014. Of those, the State Department released 296 emails related to Benghazi and Libya. The agency asserted that those were all of the Clinton emails it had pertaining to Benghazi. But in September, the State Department discovered another 925 Benghazi-related emails. Those were handed over to the House Select Committee on Benghazi. But it was revealed last month that Clinton deleted âseveral thousandâ work-related emails from her server. Do they really need a full day to prepare per email that was recovered? Must be some pretty good stuff in there… Hmmm
An Ohio judge ordered an attorney jailed for five days after she refused to remove a Black Lives Matter pin she wore to court. The lawyer is appealing the case.   Attorney Andrea Burton of Youngstown, Ohio, was charged with contempt of court and given a five-day jail sentence on July 22 after she refused to take off the pin at Judge Robert Milich's request, the New York Daily News reported. The judge reportedly called Burton, who was representing a client at the time, into his chambers and spoke privately to her about the matter. When the lawyer continued to wear the pin, he adjourned the proceedings and ordered her to be held on a contempt charge. Milich told WKBN he made his ruling based on Supreme Court precedent that allows judges to prohibit political expression in courtrooms.  “There’s a difference between a flag, a pin from your church or the Eagles and having a pin that’s on a political issue,” Milich said. The judge claimed his decision was not influenced by his own personal views. "A judge doesn't support either side," he told WKBN. "A judge is objective and tries to make sure everyone has an opportunity to have a fair hearing, and it was a situation where it was just in violation of the law." Burton has been released pending an appeal on the condition that she refrain from wearing any items that make a political statement in court. If she loses the appeal, she will have to serve five days in jail. The attorney told New York Daily News that her constitutional right to free speech superseded Supreme Court case law and the judge's discretion. “It's an act of civil disobedience, I understand that," Burton told NY Daily News. "I’m not anti-police, I work with law enforcement and I hold them in the highest regard, and just to say for the record I do believe all lives matter. But at this point they don’t all matter equally, and that’s the problem in the justice system." Mike Brickner, the senior policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, said that judges are generally given a wide latitude in what they allow or don't allow in the courtroom, although their decisions must be reasonable and fairly applied. "There have been cases in the past when people have been given contempt of court for refusing to comply with a judge's order to remove an article of clothing that may have a message on it," Brickner wrote in a July 22 email to WKBN. "Many times this has been done to retain the defendant’s right to a fair trial."  Sources: New York Daily News, WKBN / Photo credit: WFMJ via New York Daily News
During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because “he would’ve gotten it, if I wanted it.” But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul – this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports: One of these stories is a lie—a detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trump’s mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesn’t want to admit he lost. Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bush’s story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies—he had played the “cash for outcomes” political game for years—he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bush’s opposition—if Trump had wanted it. The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush would’ve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trump’s naïve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald’s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or: Now consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn’t been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple—Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect. Why is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater “scandal” for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find. Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trump’s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his party’s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it’s head. Trump’s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it’s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President. See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, there’s no third option here: Bush: “The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something—that was generous and gave me money—was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.” Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didn’t— Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didn’t get it, because I was opposed to— Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before— Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. I’m not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people. Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition: A lawyer asked Trump, “Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?” Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush…and I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didn’t you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didn’t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.
Clowns are on a rampage along the east coast. Alleged sightings from Pennsylvania down to southern Georgia have parents worried about sending their kids to school. Schools have been closed or put on lockdown after alleged clown threats, including two Alabama schools. According to AL.com: “Irondale [Alabama] police Officer James Lewis, a school resource officer, said a student reported to police that a Facebook post hinted at the possibility of clowns showing up on campus at Shades Valley High School. “There was no threat,” Lewis said. Birmingham police said Holy Family Cristo Rey High School in Ensley received a call that a clown was coming to the school to lure children to the woods. Police found nothing, said Sgt. Bryan Shelton. Similar incidents have taken place throughout Alabama, including Flomaton, Etowah County and Montgomery, and across the southeast. In some instances, children have reported clowns trying to lure them into the woods. In other cases, victims have been messaged by the so-called clowns with vulgar language.” So far, investigators have not been able to find hard evidence that there is any truth to these sightings. Thanks to social media, anything that could be the slightest bit interesting is suddenly a huge story. Things get blown out of proportion and once that happens, it’s tantamount to containing a wildfire. Real or not, quit clowning around. Scaring kids ain’t funny.    The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.
Friday morning around 4:00, three men – some of whom were armed – barged in through one of the doors of an Atlanta resident’s house. The resident’s co-worker was over for work-related reasons, and when she heard the commotion, she sprung into action, wielding a handgun. The whole episode was caught on surveillance camera that was set up inside the house. The resident’s co-worker unloaded all the rounds from her gun into the intruders’ direction, sending all three of them out the door. One of the intruders even jumped through a glass door. Two intruders are still on the loose, and a third one died from his gunshot wounds in the driveway. After the gunfight, the homeowner can be seen calming down his housemate and taking the gun away. In an interview with Channel 2, Gwinnett County Cpl. Dean Washington reacted to the incident: “She exercised her right to defend her livelihood and property.” He added: “It’s not common that we receive this caliber of surveillance video showing the crime unfold, an actual home invasion.” Washington hopes that the surveillance video will also lead to their being able to capture the two remaining suspects: “They’re not wearing anything on their faces so we’re highly anticipating someone watching the evening newscast will recognize these people.” See the surveillance footage here:     The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.

Comedian and actor Zach Galifianakis recently featured former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on his improvisational comedy interview show, Between Two Ferns. Previously, he’s interviewed President Obama as well as other celebrities like Brad Pitt and Justin Beiber, but there’s one person he refuses to have on the show. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Galifianakis was asked if he would have Republican nominee Donald Trump on his show since his interview with Clinton was such a resounding success – and his answer is hilarious. “No. That doesn’t interest me. Doing it the other way doesn’t interest me. He’s the kind of guy who likes attention – bad attention or good attention. So you’re dealing with a psychosis there that’s a little weird. I wouldn’t have somebody on that’s so mentally challenged. I feel like I’d be taking advantage of him. And you can print that.” Between Two Ferns is known for its exceptionally awkward dialogue and for the host’s fondness for asking uncomfortable questions (he once asked Pres. Obama “How does it feel to know you’re going to be the last black president?”). Part of the joke is both parties attempting to maintain their composure and not rising to the bait. Judging from the way that Donald Trump lashes out like a wounded animal at the slightest provocation and is utterly incapable of letting the pettiest slight go without a response, it’s safe to say that Galifinakis is right about how Trump would fare on his show. But it’s terrifying to think that a man who couldn’t handle being on a comedy interview show has a real shot at ascending to the presidency of the United States; he has shown time and time again that he is temperamentally unfit for the office.
I was watching a local news show about a business called “Out of the Closet.” They are a series of thrift stores to benefit AIDS Healthcare Foundation. Not only can you purchase second-hand and consignment merchandise, but you can get free HIV and STD tests.  I found this rather curious. Why would a pro-homosexual advocacy business like “Out of the Closet” be offering HIV and STD tests? What is it about the sexual practices of homosexuals that they would need to be tested for sexual diseases?  I don’t need to be tested for HIV and STDs. The only people who would need to be tested are those who engaged in behaviors that lead to HIV and STDs. If two people are married and only engage in sex with one another, neither of them would ever get HIV or an STD. The following is reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): “Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) have been increasing among gay and bisexual men, with recent increases in syphilis being documented across the country. In 2012, men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for 75% of primary and secondary syphilis cases in the United States. MSM often are diagnosed with other STDs, including chlamydia and gonorrhea infections.” One would think the AIDS scare of the 1980s would have been an empirical indicator that same-sex relationships, as well as shared drug needles, are destructive behaviors. We were told that anyone could get AIDS. There’s a commercial running today that makes this claim. If this is true, then all stores should be offering tests. But they don’t because it would be a massive insult to the vast majority of people who do not engage in same-sex sexual activity. Another empirical indicator that same-sex relationships are abnormal is that there is no chance of procreation. Homosexuals have to be artificially inseminated or adopt. When morality, science, and common sense conflict with liberal ideology, you can always count on governments to use force in order to make people comply.

Two girls were out with their mother enjoying a meal at a restaurant in Stockton, California. When they were done their meal, they left the restaurant and that’s when things went horribly south. The two teen girls, both about 100 lbs each, and their Mother encountered a group of terrible people. It was a group of Black Lives Matter supporters.  The group approached the three girls, beat them with punches and kicks, threw trash at them, screamed racist taunts about white people, and hurt them so badly that police had to rush the three girls to the hospital. What did these three girls have to do with anything? They were minding their own business enjoying some family time. Maybe if the losers in Black Lives Matter had a better family life at home, then they wouldn’t be so screwed up. Black moms often have 5+ kids and don’t really take care of any of them. The black dads are often nowhere to be found. What kind of life is that? And no, it’s not racist to say that. It’s a FACT, not a stereotype. Take a walk through any urban neighborhood and ask these “mothers” why they have multiple kids, no job, and half the kids have a different last name. Screwed up, right? One of the Black LIES Thug attackers proved just how stupid these people are. This idiot bragged about the attack and how he got his “hits” in. He supposedly had a video too! When people found out what he did, they crucified him on Facebook so bad that his account isn’t available anymore. Maybe he closed it down and went into hiding. As of right now, I don’t believe he was arrested yet. If you’re in Northern California and see this guy, then call the police and show them this article. He most likely lives in or around the Stockton, California area. His picture is below on the left. He’s the scrawny Latino looking loser who would’ve probably been beaten up by the teen girls if he didn’t have a gang with him.   Black Lives Matter is a racist terror group. They have not done anything positive for the black community. All they do is beat people up, protest in the middle of the street, loot and riot, and cause chaos. No one will ever take Black Lives Matter serious until they start acting like civil human beings. They’re a scummy joke of fatherless losers, unemployed skanks, and uneducated violent thieves. Every member of Black Lives Matter should reevaluate their life and ask themselves “why am I part of this terrible hate group?” 
Both of the 2016 presidential candidates had their chance to speak out about the recent bombings in New York and New Jersey. There are so many differences between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, just in these videos alone. Watch!  What a difference in Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton’s responses to last night’s NYC bombing. Trump said, “I must tell you that just before I got off the plane a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows what’s going on,” Trump said during a rally last night at an airport hangar in Colorado Springs, Colorado. “But boy we are living in a time — we better get very tough, folks. We better get very, very tough. It’s a terrible thing that’s going on in our world, in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant.” These comments came just minutes after the explosion occurred.  Hillary by contrast, looked like she was half asleep (or even drugged) during her response, in which she contradicted herself within a period of forty seconds. At the 0:28 mark in the video below, she states ““I’ve been briefed about the bombings in New York and New Jersey, as well as the attack in Minnesota.” Then, at 1:08, she was asked ““Do you have any reaction to the fact that Donald Trump, prior to taking the stage tonight, called the explosion tonight a bomb, and if that’s an appropriate term”?” Hillary, apparently unaware that bombings are caused by bombs, replied “Well I think it’s important to know the facts about any incident like this, that’s why it’s critical to support he first responders, the investigators, who are looking into it to determine what did happen.”  What could she possibly think was the cause of the explosion? A brain fart? The difference in the professionalism between these two is beyond me. Hillary Clinton is obviously proving herself to not be well enough to run a country. She just needs to drop out and rest.
We’ve never seen anything like this before in the sport of NASCAR… There are many people that don’t believe in things that NASCAR does. But those are mostly things like penalties and rules on the track. It’s not often that we say anyone complain about how the sport treats and includes people, simply because everyone for the most part thinks NASCAR does a pretty swell job. But it looks like there’s ONE person who disagrees. That one person is Terrance Cox III, a Georgia man who has operated Diversity Motorsports Racing as well created a group to protest against NASCAR, alleging that officials, teams and owners are unjust towards the minority community.  This past Friday, Cox filed a $500 million race discrimination lawsuit against NASCAR and its race teams due to claims that the sanctioning body of NASCAR would never help him as he tried to make NASCAR more racially diverse. In Cox’s complaint, he stated that “potential sponsors were encouraged by NASCAR to not work with him but instead go for drivers like Tony Stewart and Dale Jr.” They also allegedly refused to promote different programs that Cox created in order to make NASCAR more diverse.  Lastly, Cox is claiming that NASCAR has “engaged in unlawful intentional racial discrimination by refusing to sanction African-American owned racing teams … and by refusing to hire African-American drivers for its racing teams.” Has NASCAR responded to this? HELL YEAH! They’ve released a statement defending their Drive for Diversity program and have let Cox and everyone know that they are going to fight this lawsuit. “NASCAR embraces all individuals interested and involved in our sport, whether as partners, fans, competitors or employees, and there is no merit to this lawsuit. NASCAR has a long-standing history of investing in diversity efforts including the NASCAR Drive for Diversity, NASCAR Diversity Internship and NASCAR Diversity Pit Crew Development programs. … We stand behind our actions, and will not let a publicity-seeking legal action deter us from our mission. NASCAR not only will defend our organization against these meritless allegations, but we will be asserting our own claims against Mr. Cox for his defamatory actions. We established these [diversity] programs to create opportunities for women and minorities, and embrace people of all backgrounds, within the industry. Diversity both on and off the track continues to be a top priority for NASCAR and its stakeholders.“ There is one full-time African-American driver in NASCAR and his name is Darrell Wallace Jr. Wallace races for Roush Fenway Racing and competes in the Xfinity Series. We will give further detail as the case unfolds. 
Between the protests in Charlotte and athletes across the country refusing to stand for the National Anthem, the Black Lives Matter movement is getting a lot of attention. But not everyone is on board. Cleveland Cavaliers star Lebron James was giving a press conference, where he was asked for his opinion on athletes refusing to stand for the National Anthem in support of Black Lives Matter. And his response made liberals furious.   James began his statement by saying that while he respected Colin Kaepernick, he didn’t agree with the protest. “Me, standing for the national anthem is something I will do. That’s who I am,” he explained. “That’s what I believe in. But that doesn’t mean I don’t respect and don’t agree with what Colin Kaepernick is doing.” It was an exceedingly fair statement, but James wasn’t done yet. He continued, saying, “I’m not up here saying that all the police are bad, because they’re not. I’m not up here saying all kids are great and all adults are great, because they’re not. But at the same time, all lives do matter. It’s not just about black or white, it’s everyone.”   Well, James did himself in there, because “all lives matter”? That phrase is unforgivable to liberals. And they quickly began not only attacking James for his statement, they even accused James — a black man — of racism. No, really:  Lebron James better sit for the anthem or he a Uncle Tom — Black skip baeless (@Rusjacksbrook) September 26, 2016  "All Lives Matter" is a dog whistle, a thing racists say that doesn't sound racist at 1st glance but clearly communicates a racist idea. — Jerry Topsider (@BostonJerry) September 26, 2016  You can't expect some of these so-call athletes to take a stand with their own people. Money is the power to keep them neutral #LeBronJames — Aaron SpiveySorrells (@aaronss101) September 26, 2016   But not everyone was quick to slam him. Some people wisely remembered that James is much more of a friend to the minority community than Black Lives Matter activists are:  LeBron James just donated $41.8M to the University of Akron in Ohio, giving 1,100 kids a full 4-yr scholarship but y'all calling him a coon. — NUFF$AID (@nuffsaidNY) September 26, 2016   The Black Lives Matter movement doesn’t do much to improve things for inner-city kids or the minority community. LeBron James does. But hey, keep smearing him as a racist Uncle Tom because he said something you don’t agree with. Great idea. 
A protester was shot in the head during Wednesday night’s protests in Charlotte, North Carolina in response to the killing of Keith Lamont Scott. According to The Guardian, the protester, whose name has not yet been publicly released as of this writing, was intially declared dead, but his medical status has since been updated to severely wounded and in critical condition. There are conflicting accounts as to who was responsible for the shooting. 350.org national organizer Todd Zimmer took a photo of a pool of blood on the sidewalk in Charlotte’s Uptown district left behind from the wounded protester. While a Daily Beast reporter attributed the shooting to another protester, Zimmer said he personally witnessed police shoot the protester in the head with a tear gas canister or rubber bullet, saying his city was “lying” about the person responsible. I was there when CMPD shot a protestor in the head tonight. I am convinced that police shot this person with a rubber… Posted by Todd Zimmer on Wednesday, September 21, 2016 Jimmy James Tyson, a Charlotte native who joined the protesters after Scott’s death, also said he witnessed police fire the shot that knocked the protester to the sidewalk. Tyson said the projectile that hit the protester was a rubber bullet. I’m home now, burning up all over my body, but I’m okay. Had to get in cold water, soap, and vinegar. Beet red. And… Posted by Jimmy James Tyson on Wednesday, September 21, 2016   Skirmishes between rioters and police have continued to escalate this week, and North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory has declared a state of emergency, deploying the national guard to assist the police response to the riots. In video posted to YouTube by the Associated Press, CMPD officers are seen firing tear gas and flash bang grenades at protesters in an attempt to disperse the crowds, while also arresting protesters standing quietly in the street with their arms raised.  Protests erupted in the community after CMPD officer Brentley Vinson killed 43-year-old, who family members say was shot while reading in his car, waiting for his son’s school bus to arrive. While CMPD maintains that Scott had a gun and refused to comply with orders to drop the alleged firearm, Scott’s siblings insist the object in his hands was a book, not a gun. Officers were searching for another suspect with an outstanding warrant when they killed Scott, who was not the suspect in question. As of this writing, CMPD have not yet released the video of Scott’s death.        
It’s happy times for ISIS and Caliphate supporters everywhere as they deliriously report and applaud the allegedly terrorist bomb that exploded in New York and the ISIS inspired knife attacker in a Minnesota mall. After the bomb went off, social media blew up with proud jihadist sympathizers scoring one for their team. Some of the comments on social media were as follows; “The lions of the Caliphate roar in New York, we cause you pain inside your house, the carrier of the Cross,” wrote one Twitter user who went by the name “I am ISIS, come and block me.” The account was soon suspended. Another, called “The Lone Wolves,” tweeted with the Arabic hashtag #ExplosionManhattanNewYork “Oh God burn America, take revenge in the name of your oppressed slaves and believers’ blood.” Others tweeted about “good tidings that keep coming” from New York, and one user affiliated with al-Qaeda in Syria tweeted: “Oh God go against America, the head of infidels. Oh God, count them and kill them one by one, and do not spare anyone of them.”   Evil walks this earth. It’s name is radical Islamic terrorism. It celebrates when the blood of infidels (meaning regular people who do not agree with radical Islam) is spilled. It laughs with glee when New York is terrorized. It mocks westerners, Americans, Christians and Jews. It cares nothing for pain, suffering and outrage. It wishes and works for the day that Islam dominates the earth. That evil prowls social media taking credit for and celebrating bloodshed. And this newest event is no exception. There is joy among jihadists as New Yorkers and Minnesotans lie in their own blood. They need to be stopped. But who will do it? See video of explosion below.   
Is it just me or has there been a rash of teachers behaving poorly across the nation? Maybe it’s always existed, but now because of social media, it comes out faster. Whatever the reason for the seeming increase of crappy educators, we can all agree that it’s NOT okay for anyone to call our kids “racists” for any reason. Period. End of discussion.  Veronica Welsh of Smithtown, NY called her students “racist” for doing absolutely nothing racist. They weren’t using racial slurs, they weren’t excluding minorities from their clubs, teams, groups, etc. They weren’t doing ANYTHING except, wait for it, wearing pro-Trump gear on USA day. These teachers are just part of a growing group of increasingly-liberal educators that have our children 7-8 hours a day. If this doesn’t frighten you, then you’re not paying attention. The Smithtown Superintendent called the act: “…An extremely unfortunate incident and these actions are not promoted by the Smithtown Central School District Administration and Board of Education, nor do they reflect the attitudes of our students and staff.” Of course when people get caught being jerks to others, they preach about their First Amendment rights and complain about the repercussions of their actions. Let’s not get into the fact that the First Amendment protects you from the government, not from being fired from your job for saying something outrageous. Are you being imprisoned? No? Alrighty then, you’re exercising your First Amendment rights and we’re exercising our right to hit back against your rhetoric. But let’s look into what punishment this teacher faced, because I think you might be surprised to hear what happened to her almost immediately after this nasty Facebook post hit the web. The Smithtown Superintendent said that Veronica Walsh has been sanctioned and “administratively reassigned.” Gotta love that karma bus. It’s going to be a difficult road trying to get another job in education with a history that is currently all over the news. 
In this video we posted yesterday, Clinton appears to lose eye control. Shortly after this event, she canceled her posh fundraiser in North Carolina scheduled for the same day, mere minutes down the road from where she was. However it’s was worse than we thought, as one of our researchers discovered this about Hillary Clinton’s schedule. Interesting fact….I just searched Hillary Clinton’s rally events scheduled between September 20 – October 19 – She has ONE scheduled. The rest of the events are fundraisers and the schedule doesn’t list her as a speaker at any of the fundraisers. Trump has FOUR rallies scheduled between September 20-22!!!!   There are many questions about her health, and admittedly I’m no expert. However I am a realist. I recently posted that Hillary Clinton needed Secret Service to help her up TWO steps at this very rally. What healthy person needs help up two steps? And the secret service man had a vice grip on Clinton’s left hand.  I further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down. Further rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, and doesn’t appear to want to be president any longer. As for Hillary Clinton’s health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill. The Left won’t be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the “conspirators.” Worse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to America what we already know about Democrats. They are crooked to their black cores. Expect lots more on this to surface over the next few days. 
Itâs official. Trumpâs supporters will vote for Donald Trump no matter what he does or what lies he tells, even if his tax returns reveal the truth. During his show on Tuesday night, Jimmy Kimmel ran yet another âLie Witness Newsâ segment featuring Trump supporters being asked questions based on the false story of him finally releasing his tax returns. The Kimmel reporter on the street asked Trump fans what they think now that the tax returns reveal that Trump is close with Putin, leases his wife Melania, writes off gold-plated toilets as a business expense, and supports child molester Jared Fogle. As it turns out, every single Trump supporter said they are still voting for the Republican nominee no matter what, even if it is true that Trump contributed to the legal defense fund of a convicted child molester. In fact, his supporters made excuses for Trump in order to justify his actions. So when Donald Trump said that he could go out and shoot someone dead in broad daylight in the middle of Fifth Avenue and not lose any votes, he was right. Because Trumpâs supporters were not fazed by any of the claims presented to them. They were even okay with him lying on his returns by listing his occupation as a farmer. Seriously. Hereâs the video via YouTube.  Trumpâs supporters are truly deplorable people who just want to watch the world burn. It doesnât matter what he says or what he does or how much he embarrasses America, Donald Trumpâs supporter will vote for him no matter what. So the question is will the rest of us sit home on Election Day and let the lunatics win? Or will we get our asses off the couch and make sure Donald Trump never sets a single toe inside the White House? Because if his supporters donât mind him doing all of these despicable things, that means Trump could basically do whatever he wants in office without political consequences and that would be disastrous for the nation. 
Judge Jeanine Pirro has been all over Hillary Clinton and her lack of truthfulness ever since the infamous email scandal broke. We don’t blame her, Hillary’s lies have, in all likelihood, gotten people killed and put America at risk, not to mention the fact that she’s lied to Congress and the FBI and countless other government bodies. So, Pirro decided to take Clinton down on the eve of the first presidential debate, in the classiest way possible – by propping up Trump. Epic.  “Donald, it’s real simple.  You’re new at this.  If you are yourself, you will obliterate her like you did those 16 others on those Republican primary debate stages,” Pirro said of her longtime friend, Donald Trump. “Your opponent cannot handle the truth. She can’t handle a direct question. Nor is she able to give a direct response.  Do not let her do the Washington two-step.  Stay on offense.  Without being offensive.” Pirro also suggested Trump should ignore Clinton’s gender as a reason to be considerably kinder to her than he would if he were debating a man. “She wants to be the leader of the free world– gender is irrelevant. Make her prove she’s up to it both mentally, physically and historically.” She also advised he be more “presidential” than in prior debates, where nicknames like “Lyin’ Ted”and “Little Marco” were common expressions: “You’re a smart man Donald. This is the time to be presidential.  No smirks.  No faces.” Pirro suggested to Clinton that she too be herself—“Cold.  Calculating. Imperialistic.” “And Hillary, don’t shy away from talking about your record.  The state of the world in chaos with you in charge of foreign policy– unless of course you don’t want to,” she said. Will you be watching the debate tonight? Let’s hear it in the comments! (Source: Fox News) 
Over half a century after her parents' death, a woman has received a “Christmas Miracle” thanks to a very determined complete stranger. In 1959, Joyce Wharton’s parents boarded a plane bound for Seattle. The plane crashed and her parents were never heard from again. The plane wreckage was found 15 years later, in the deep woods of Washington state, reports The Blaze. The unanswered questions Joyce and the rest of her family had lived with for so long finally were answered. "They went out to the airport and left, but they never arrived in Seattle," Joyce told ABC 6. "So for many many years, we didn't know what had happened." Now, more than half a century later, Joyce has received a very special gift that belonged to her mother: Her wedding ring. The ring was discovered by Nick Buchanan, a Washington logger who came across it near the crash site. Buchanan wanted to find the rightful owner of the ring, and with the help of his nephew and Ancestry.com they were able to track down Joyce who lives all the way across the country in New Jersey.  Buchanan called Joyce to tell her he had found the ring and wanted to return it to her. "He said 'Joyce, I have your mother's ring, and I've been looking for you all these years and I want you to have this,'" Joyce said. It took Buchanan years before he found Joyce, but his determination paid off.  "My mouth was open," Joyce said. "I couldn't believe what I was hearing...it restores your faith in human nature, because there's so many bad things happening. And yet there are good people out there, kind people. People persevere. "To see a ring that the last time I saw this ring, my mother was wearing it 55 years ago, that's my Christmas miracle."   Sources: The Blaze, ABC 6 / Photo Source: The Blaze
Last night, Fox News reporter Steve Harrigan was reporting live in Charlotte, North Carolina to cover Â police brutality protests that had erupted after a shooting. Perhaps because Fox News has typically shamed these kinds of protests and ran footage that depicted protesters as thugs and looters in the past, Harrigan got his a** handed to him by a protester that didnât hesitate to confront the notoriously racist network. The female African American protester went right up to Harrigan and decided to educate him about why she and other protesters had gathered. When Harrigan tried to shame her for being outside in an area where someone had just gotten shot, the protester couldnât tolerate his ignorance and white privilege anyÂ longer. Harrigan made the mistake of asking her,Â âIf a man was shot about 50 yards over there, we donât know by who. Why are you here?â And that was it. The protester went off, and replied to Harrigan,Â âBecause I serve a purposeâ right before giving him a brutal lesson in racism. She forcefully said that no matter where she is, at any given moment she could be shot just because of the color of her skin. She said: âI could be at work, at school, in my car, I can still get shot â by the police!â Pointing out the fact that racism still exists in America, she continued: âWe are not the same. We are human, but I am black and you are white so donât tell me not to come over hereâ¦â Harrigan tried to jump in, but the protester quickly called him out for âusing sarcasmâÂ as a crowd began to gather, and accused the network of only being at the protests so that they could get video footage andÂ âmake a f*cking fabricated storyâ â which we all know Fox News has done in the past. You can watch the protester shut down Fox News below:  
Trump currently has his hands full with the ongoing lawsuit against his company âTrump Universityâ. Â Now, a federal judge, the same one Trump insulted during a recent rally, has ordered that Trump University documents be released. Trumpâs attorneys tried to avoid this outcome by claiming that the documents they were requesting included important trade secrets. Â But that didnât stop Judge Gonzalo Curiel. The result of this decision could certainly be damaging for the Trump campaign. Â While Trump can brush many things off his back for some unknown reason, the idea of a fraud university that tricked college-aged students and put them into debt is rather disturbing. Furthermore, Judge Curiel stated that part of the reason he wanted the documents released is the public interest in Trumpâs case. Itâs clear that Trump has felt threatened by this whole ordeal. Â For 12 whole minutes of a 58 minute speech, Trump insulted this judge and claimed he wasnât playing fair. Â Citing the fact that this judge was appointed by President Obama, and that he has made rulings against Trump, Trump claims he is biased. He also indirectly insinuated that the judge is biased because he is âMexicanâ (which actually isnât true at all, even if that mattered â heâs from the US). Trump University was started in 2004 as a firm to offer courses and workshops in entrepreneurship. Â The University used the Trump brand and marketed it as an opportunity to be a apprentice of Trump himself. Â Trump became a 93% owner of the enterprise and has benefitted from its profits. The problem is that many students believe they have not benefitted from the instruction. Â The university is not accredited, you canât earn a degree, and yet thousands of students took out tens of thousands of dollars worth of loans to attend. Â Several lawsuits were placed against the âuniversityâ by its students. The state of New York even placed their complaints against Trump University. Â The state filed a $40 million lawsuit saying the school gave âfalse promisesâ. Â The New York State Board of Education claimed it was âmisleading and even illegalâ to call the firm a university. As a result, the name changed to the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative in 2010. Â Around 80,000 people have been documented as attending free introductory seminars, while 9000 paid $1,500 for three-day seminars. Â All of that doesnât sound too bad, but take into account that 800 people paid around $35,000 for larger packages such as mentorship programs. In the lawsuit by the state of New York, under New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, it was alleged that Trump defrauded over 5,000 individuals. In a script only Trump could use, he claimed in marketing videos for the school that: âWe are going to have professors and adjust professors that are absolutely terrificâ¦and these are all people who are going to be handpicked by me.â Michael Sexton, one of the top executives of the institution, said himself that ânone of the professors at the live eventsâ were actually picked by Trump. The story and lawsuit of Trump University may just be one of the most symbolic things about the Trump candidacy and the man himself. Â He uses his name recognition and the perception of wealth and success to further his interests. Â Itâs essentially âIâm rich because Iâm rich, now give me more money/power because Iâm richâ. By tagging his name along with the name of an unaccredited educational institution, thousands of people were duped into believing it would be worth their money. If Trump University had been named the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative all along, perhaps the allegations would seem more hollow. Â After all, people pay for overpriced seminars and workshops all the time. However, naming the institution âTrump Universityâ gives it the illusion that it is the kind of place a student could come to get a degree in lieu of another college. Â That is just simply not the case. In the end, this lawsuit could end in Trump losing tens of millions of dollars, along with tens of millions of votes. Â Thatâs a huge chunk of his fortune given that, depending on who listen to, some analysts estimate he is only worth between 20-70 million in terms of cash, assets and bonds. He himself claims he is worth several billion, but the truth is probably somewhere in-between.
Blue Bell just did the one thing we all hoped would never happen again, this is a nightmare. In 2015 we were all devastated when our favorite ice cream had a HUGE recall taking it off the shelves for months. This was their first recall in over 100 years! Eventually toward the end of 2016 we started seeing Blue Bell back out on the shelves, but now there has been another recall on the products!  The company is now voluntarily recalling several of their ice-cream products because they are concerned that they may contain “listeria bacteria”. Unfortunately, they have recalled two of their products that contain chocolate chip cookie dough. Blue Bell stated that the dough was being made by a third party known as Aspen Hills Inc. The good news is that there haven’t been any reports of illness from the ice cream but Blue Bell is wanting to take precautions before their are any. The company posted the recall on their Facebook yesterday. “Out of an abundance of caution, we are voluntarily recalling select products that contain a chocolate chip cookie dough ingredient. Aspen Hills, Inc., who supplies us with this ingredient, has issued a voluntary recall on select lots of chocolate chip cookie dough supplied to Blue Bell. No illnesses have been reported to date, but Blue Bell is taking this step because we remain committed to producing a safe, high-quality, great-tasting ice cream for you and your family to enjoy.”  Apparently the ice cream was distributed in 10 states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. Blue Bell also posted a list of recalled products to ensure that no one is eating them. Blue Bell Ice Cream Half Gallons: Code Dates Blue Bell Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough 082618226 Blue Bell Cookie Two Step 080418222, 081818224 Blue Bell Ice Cream Pints: Code Dates Blue Bell Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough 081518242, 082418242 Aspen Hills Inc. wrote a letter about the recall stating that the contaminated cookie dough could cause fever, headaches, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Not only that but if you are pregnant the infection can cause miscarriages and still-births. Blue Bell was sold in over 30 states before their huge recall last year, and some of those places are barely getting the ice cream back out on the shelves. One store in particular recited their shipment of Blue Bell only two days before the big recall! We’re all smiles in Raleigh, NC, because Blue Bell is back! Look for it in stores in Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill and surrounding areas. pic.twitter.com/WuzAGUSpH0 — Blue Bell Ice Cream (@ILoveBlueBell) September 19, 2016  This is so sad!!

Tony Yapias took umbrage at Donald Trump for calling some Latinos coming from Mexico illegally “rapist.” Yapias’ crime? Rape. Oh the irony. As FOX News reported, Well-known Hispanic activist Tony Yapias was charged with rape after he allegedly assaulted a woman who ended their four-year relationship a few months ago. Yapias, 50, known as Adolfo Tony Yapias-Delgado, was formally charged in the 3rd District Monday with rape, a first-degree felony and evidence tampering, a class A misdemeanor. Yapias is the director of Proyecto Latino de Utah. “No” means “no”, even in Spanish, Antonio! According to court documents Yapias went to the woman’s home in South Salt Lake on March 21. “The victim had terminated the relationship 10 days prior and had expressed strongly and repeatedly in text messages that the relationship was over and she did not want anything to do with the defendant,” court documents state. Documents indicate that Yapias persisted and went to her home. “…The victim’s last text to the defendant, before he arrived at her home said: ‘I said no. don’t you get it.’ The defendant responded with a series of three text messages as follows: ‘No, I don’t get it,’ then ‘I’ll be there’ followed a short time later by ‘I’m here,’” It appears Yapias wasn’t concerned about any borders or rights of people not to be harassed. Let’s see if the Liberals can figure out a way to make a poster child out of this monster.   
Should he or shouldn’t he? Should debate moderator Lester Holt “fact-check” the candidates?  That is one of the big questions about tonight’s debate at Hofstra, University. IMHO Being a moderator at a debate is a lot like being an umpire at a baseball game. If you leave the game talking about the umpire it means the umpire screwed up. But just like major decisions in my household, the question of fact-checking is not my decision; it’s the moderator’s and there is pressure on him from team Clinton and the liberal media to play truth police as well as moderate the debate. In 2012, Candy Crowley was more than a moderator at the Hofstra debate. She was an active participant not allowing Romney to answer Obama’s attacks, and incorrectly fact-checking the Republican candidate. The Hofstra debate in 2012 will always be known as the one Candy Crowley screwed up. It is also known as the one where Candy Crowley stalked me. I was in the spin room for that debate and she kept trying to take over my computer. That experience is one of the reasons I decided not to go this year (well that and the fact that I didn’t get credentialed). Candy Crowley’s faux pas changed the momentum of the race. Barack Obama lost the first debate badly, and Romney was winning debate number two, until Crowley got involved.

Media outlets have made it official: Just before tonight’s first 2016 presidential debate, Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump is leading! Democrats were recently ready to measure the drapes in the White House. But according to Bloomberg Politics, Clinton’s once seemly insurmountable lead has officially “collapsed.” As Bloomberg reports: Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are locked in a tied two-way race for the presidency as they head to Hofstra University in New York on Monday night for one of the most highly anticipated debates in modern politics. The Republican and Democratic nominees each get 46 percent of likely voters in a head-to-head contest in the latest Bloomberg Politics national poll, while Trump gets 43 percent to Clinton’s 41 percent when third-party candidates are included. Clinton faces higher expectations as tens of millions of people tune in for a television spectacle that could reach Super Bowl viewership levels. About half, 49 percent, say they anticipate the former secretary of state will perform better, while 39 percent say that for Trump, a real-estate developer and former TV personality And, Hillary has lost support among women and younger Millennial voters: Ann Selzer, the Iowa-based pollster who oversaw the survey, said there are signs that Clinton’s margins with women and young voters have eroded over the past three months, helping to explain Trump’s gains. New national Bloomberg poll just released – thank you! Join the MOVEMENT: https://t.co/3KWOl2ibaW. #TrumpTrain #MAGA pic.twitter.com/4kQX4pmt0I — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2016  In addition, pollsters noted that more of Trump’s voters are excited to vote for him than Hillary voters are about voting for her. It’s clear that Hillary Clinton’s ongoing criminal activity, the questionable ways she became wealthy, and her ongoing health struggles have doomed a campaign that once looked invincible. The Clinton political machine that used to control the message through the liberal media in the 1990s simply can’t hide from today’s alternative media. Hillary Clinton is being exposed, and voters are paying attention. This is what Hillary Clinton’s poll numbers look like today: What do you think about Hillary Clinton’s collapse in the polls? Please leave us a comment (below) and tell us what you think.  
This is just plain sad. Muslim extremists are training children to be suicide bombers. Iraqi news station Kurdistan News 24 caught this child suicide bombers capture on film and it went viral. At 2 minutes 17 seconds into the video you can see the child’s face. It’s a haunting look of horror and defiance on his face. The Kurdish news source BasNews reported that ISIS has recently opened a child jihadi training center in Mosul called the “Cubs of the Caliphate,” where tiny children are brainwashed with ISIS ideology, taught suicide tactics, and receive instruction on combat training The barbaric Islamic State is doing anything it takes to spread their caliphate across the globe. Child suicide bombers is the new horrific trend of Muslim extremists. In the past 6 months ISIS has trained over 1,000 children to become suicide bombers. It is only the very base of humanity who has ever used children in warfare and ISIS is the lowest of them all. I want you to imagine WHAT kind of training is used to get a child to strap a bomb onto themselves then walk into a crowded place and detonate it. Let THAT sink it… religion of peace indeed. A child suicide bomber detonated a bomb in his vest at a Turkish wedding just last week. Over a hundred were maimed or killed in the incident. The young boy in the video below was caught by Iraqi police who thought he was acting suspiciously. This footage below is of the police removing the bomb from his body. Anyone who uses children in such a way is going to hell and I am surprised that the Muslim Imams aren’t saying that. This sickening culture is spreading across Europe and the United States as men roam the streets raping women and children as young as 5-yrs-old (that’s been reported) because it’s part of the culture. It is no surprise then that these same ‘men’ would use children to spread their campaign of terror and death.  
This is just beautiful. This is the way it should be. No government involvement, no forcing people to do things they don’t want to do, just the people using their views to give their opinions on the NFL National Anthem controversy. I’m not a big sports fan, but I know several people who are. They bleed their team colors and are a little too serious about winning. They would travel across the country to see their team play and they have cut their ties with the NFL. Their hardcore devotion to their team is not enough to get them past the fact that they don’t want to see the country they love disrespected by people who have done nothing but gain from our freedom. SANTA CLARA, CA – SEPTEMBER 12: Colin Kaepernick #7 of the San Francisco 49ers kneels in protest during the National Anthem prior to playing the Los Angeles Rams in their NFL game at Levi’s Stadium on September 12th, 2016 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Robert Reiners/Getty Images) James Olson is not alone, but he is a perfect example of what millions of Americans are feeling right now. James Olson, a Sports Illustrated subscriber since fourth grade, watches action-packed NFL games on TV to escape from the endless round of political bickering playing out on other channels. But with more national anthem protests cropping up, he feels like politics has taken over his favorite sport, too. So he’s tuning out. “I want to say to these guys ‘If you weren’t playing in the NFL, you would be working at McDonalds. I think people have had it,” said, Olson, a Birmingham, Mich., resident. People don’t watch sports for half-baked political statements, they watch because they like to see their favorite player score, giving them bragging rights until the next game. If they wanted politics, they’d turn on the news. What happens when a beloved sport like football becomes entwined with something as deeply divisive as politics? Well according to Forbes, the first official game of the season brought in 13% fewer viewers than last year. This, they said, is the lowest number of live viewers in the last seven years. So, now I pose a question to you; should Americans turn off the TV when football comes on? Should we choose to support our nation over our favorite team and more importantly, do you actually think it will yield the desired results? Let us know your thoughts on our Facebook page! 
So here is a moral question, are you responsible for telling your partner you have an STD or is it only if they ask? Or is your partner responsible for keeping themselves clean? Apparently Jim Carrey’s ex-girlfriend committed suicide after contracting a sexually transmitted disease and/or infection from him. Carrey found out that he is being sued for her wrongful death by her estranged husband.   According to the reports, he’s being sued for illegally acquiring pain killers that were found in her body and were eventually ruled to be her cause of death. He denied the claims that he gave her three STDs, Herpes 1&2 and Gonnorhea. Now, a handwritten letter has been made public that details the torture that Cathriona White faced after she contracted the diseases. Say: ‘I gave you this, intentional or not, I gave it to you. I understand that this is something that will affect you for the rest of your life and future relationships. What can make this right?’ Instead of that, I was disrespected, degraded, called a whore, an opportunist, threatened, our relationship belittled. …and I don’t really think you can see. Like it’s not an issue to you. I’m just an ungrateful bitch who you’ve done so much for and I took advantage. That simply is not true. Picking myself back up emotionally and mentally is one thing, people have bad experience and break-ups, it’s hard but with time they move on, meet someone new, start over. Add in disease. How does someone move on and meet someone new? …I am damaged. I am disgusting. When I shower I feel sick. Getting turned on…what’s that? Certainly not something that happens (to) me any more. I will always be damaged goods and have a stigma attached. So I have to accept something I was always afraid of. Being alone. Being abandoned and alone.” The closing of her letter is perhaps the most heartbreaking part of the whole thing, and honestly, it made me cry. “Be good to yourself. I will always have love in my heart for you. I pray that you are content and have peace in your life and in your soul.” It takes a big person to wish well the very person who is the reason she is so miserable that she took her own life. Whose side are you on, team Carrey or team White? 
While the media was busy talking about the NYC bombings and the arrest of Ahmad Khan Rahami, there was another bomb threat in Houston, Texas that did not receive nearly the same media attention. LA Times reporter Matt Pierce felt the incident was doomed from the start, and took to Twitter to imply that this story was pretty much guaranteed to not receive as much attention as the NYC bombings because of the skin color of the criminal involved.  According to a news release from U.S. Attorney Kenneth Magidson, Houston man Cary Lee Ogborn was arrested last Friday after he was discovered to be at the center of a bomb plot targeting Houston, Texas. The statement from the U.S. Attorney specified that, “Cary Lee Ogborn is charged with attempting to transport explosives with the intent that those explosives be used to kill, injure, or intimidate any individual or to damage or destroy a vehicle or building. He was arrested late Friday after picking up a package he believed contained such explosives.” Although Ogborn’s plan to attack Houston was thwarted before it could cause a tragedy, Matt Pearce’s tweet struck a chord with many people who are disappointed the media is more likely to push a story when it advances a criminal narrative that fits a profitable “news-worthy formula” usually including Islamic terrorism or black and latino criminality. Despite the high-profile coverage of several attacks committed by Islamic terrorists, the numbers just do not reflect this narrative. Research from Gallup and the Triangle Center On Homeland and Security found that “Law enforcement agencies in the United States consider anti-government violent extremists, not radicalized Muslims, to be the most severe threat of political violence that they face” due to the fact that “Muslim-American terrorist suspects and perpetrators in the decade since 9/11, [represent] just a small percentage of the thousands of acts of violence that occur in the United States each year.” 
When asked to explain the unexplainable, the Clinton strategist, Joel Benson, could not do it. Chris Wallace at FOX tried to get the reason for Cheryl Mills asking for immunity in FBI investigation. Se the non-response in the video. BY: Chandler Gill for Washington Free Beacon: The chief strategist for Hillary Clinton’s campaign, Joel Benenson, could not clearly explain Sunday why Clinton’s former chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, asked the FBI for limited immunity if she did nothing wrong. “Let’s turn to another issue,” Fox News’ Chris Wallace said. “We learned on Friday that as part of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email system that Cheryl Mills, her chief of staff when Clinton was secretary of state, that she was one of the people, five people, who received limited immunity. How do you explain that, Joel?”  Benenson first said that limited immunity is “fairly routine.” “It’s fairly appropriate and routine when people are sitting down with them, turning over a wealth of materials that have nothing to do with the investigation at hand,” Benenson said……. Full Story Here: Benenson Has Trouble Explaining Why Mills Asked for Immunity
San Fransisco 49er’s second string qyaurteback, Colin Kaepernick, has upset a lot of people with his accusations against America. His protests have been praised and criticized. Retired Marine Col. Jeffrey A. Powers is upset but not at Kaepernick. Powers is especially upset with the NFL commissioner Goodell for allowing anthem protests and for fining players who honored the anniversary of 9/11 last week. No joke! But what he said about all of it in a letter made me fall out of my chair!   Below, is the letter in full, but let me show you a couple of lines that got me cheering, had me laughing and had me crying! I cheered! “Now I watch multi-millionaire athletes who never did anything in their lives but play a game, disrespect what brave Americans fought and died for. They are essentially spitting in the faces and on the graves of real men, men who have actually done something for this country beside playing with a ball and believing they’re something special! They’re not! My Marines and Soldiers were!” I about fell off my chair… so funny and true: “Legends and heroes do NOT wear shoulder pads, they wear body armor and carry rifles.” I cried: “I missed the ’90-’91 season because I was with a battalion of Marines in Desert Storm. 14 of my wonderful Marines returned home with the American Flag draped across their lifeless bodies. My last conversation with one of them, Sgt Garrett Mongrella, was about how our Giants were going to the Super Bowl. He never got to see it. Many friends, Marines, and Special Forces Soldiers who worked with or for me through the years returned home with the American Flag draped over their coffins.” And then he blamed the Commissioner for his football players being so weak minded. Read the entire thing HERE:   Commissioner, I’ve been a season pass holder at Yankee Stadium, Yale Bowl and Giants Stadium. I missed the ’90-’91 season because I was with a battalion of Marines in Desert Storm. 14 of my wonderful Marines returned home with the American Flag draped across their lifeless bodies. My last conversation with one of them, Sgt Garrett Mongrella, was about how our Giants were going to the Super Bowl. He never got to see it. Many friends, Marines, and Special Forces Soldiers who worked with or for me through the years returned home with the American Flag draped over their coffins. Now I watch multi-millionaire athletes who never did anything in their lives but play a game, disrespect what brave Americans fought and died for. They are essentially spitting in the faces and on the graves of real men, men who have actually done something for this country beside playing with a ball and believing they’re something special! They’re not! My Marines and Soldiers were! You are complicit in this! You’ll fine players for large and small infractions but you lack the moral courage and respect for our nation and the fallen to put an immediate stop to this. Yes, I know, it’s their 1st Amendment right to behave in such a despicable manner. What would happen if they came out and disrespected you or the refs publicly? I observed a player getting a personal foul for twerking in the end zone after scoring. I guess that’s much worse than disrespecting the flag and our National Anthem. Hmmmmm, isn’t it his 1st Amendment right to express himself like an idiot in the end zone? Why is taunting not allowed yet taunting America is OK? You fine players for wearing 9-11 commemorative shoes yet you allow scum on the sidelines to sit, kneel or pump their pathetic fist in the air. They are so deprived with their multi-million dollar contracts for playing a freaking game! You condone it all by your refusal to act. You’re just as bad and disgusting as they are. I hope Americans boycott any sponsor who supports that rabble you call the NFL. I hope they turn off the TV when any team that allowed this disrespect to occur, without consequence, on the sidelines. I applaud those who have not. Legends and heroes do NOT wear shoulder pads. They wear body armor and carry rifles. They make minimum wage and spend months and years away from their families. They don’t do it for an hour on Sunday. They do it 24/7 often with lead, not footballs, coming in their direction. They watch their brothers carted off in pieces not on a gurney to get their knee iced. They don’t even have ice! Many don’t have legs or arms. Some wear blue and risk their lives daily on the streets of America. They wear fire helmets and go upstairs into the fire rather than down to safety. On 9-11, hundreds vanished. They are the heroes. I hope that your high paid protesting pretty boys and you look in that mirror when you shave tomorrow and see what you really are, legends in your own minds. You need to hit the road and take those worms with you! Time to change the channel. 
For the last two nights, events in Charlotte have been out of control. Protesters quickly turned into violent domestic terrorists destroying personal property, setting fires, looting stores, attacking reporters, photographers, police, and other innocent bystanders in response to the officer-involved shooting of Keith Scott, a black man who was shot by a black officer after he did not heed commands to drop his weapon. The narrative told by the anarchists, however, is that Scott was reading a book, even though no book was found on the scene. On Tuesday night, a truck driver feared for her life as her truck was surrounded by a mob of people who looted the contents of her truck and burned them in the middle of the street. More than 16 officers had to receive medical attention at the hospital due to attacks by the rabid mob. On Wednesday night, a photographer was rendered unconscious by these domestic terrorists who then tried to throw him into a burning trash can. Another white man was targeted and attacked by a mob of black men who dragged him, kicked him, and stomped on him. A “protester” was shot by another “protester” and is fighting for his life. The situation in Charlotte is so out of control that a State of Emergency was called last night and the National Guard has been deployed for Thursday. But looking at Barack Obama’s Twitter account, you wouldn’t know that anything at all has been happening in Charlotte. One would be under the impression there is no unrest, violence, and destruction of a city at all, let alone two nights in a row. Why is that? Because Obama has not made a peep about it on Twitter. He has not said one solitary thing about the chaos and violence in Charlotte. Instead, he’s busy tweeting trying to strong-arm Congress into confirming his Supreme Court choice, Merrick Garland, and about climate change. On Wednesday, the day after the first night of mayhem and violence, Obama tweeted twice about climate change and twice about Merrick Garland. Communities are already experiencing the effects of climate change—we can't afford not to act. Take a look: https://t.co/WnBmiZDMr3 pic.twitter.com/3BFbRDUXBv — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) September 21, 2016  "Their right to inherit a healthy planet is a sacred responsibility." —President Obama #ActOnClimate https://t.co/MYumi6xiIW — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) September 21, 2016  The American Bar Association gave Judge Garland its highest possible rating.

Why is that a big deal?” Here is why it’s a big deal. Barack Obama has used Twitter to push his campaign, his policies, and his agenda ever since he started his account when campaigning for president in 2007. He uses it as a mouthpiece and propaganda tool. His 77.5 million followers would have no idea that anything is happening in Charlotte since Obama, the current President of the United States, has not even so much as acknowledged it at all. Again, he’s too busy pushes his SCOTUS nominee and climate change because, obviously, that’s more important that domestic terrorists tearing apart a city. Shameful.    Email Subscribe
As if Donald Trump’s plan to ban Muslim immigration didn’t infuriate liberals enough, his plan to stop the Islamization of America has another component. Trump also expressed interest in deporting any Muslims who express support for Sharia law. In a bad turn of events for liberals, some actually attempted to hilariously defend Sharia in response to the latter. CNN commenter Sally Kohn took to Twitter, writing “Hey Donald Trump, many progressive Muslims — the ones we should support in ideaological fight against extremism — believe in Sharia!!” By the way, Kohn is a lesbian, and would be put to death under Sharia law. There’s no disagreement among scholars of Islamic law that death is the punishment for homosexuality – the debate is over how they should be killed. If that’s “progressive,” we have even more reasons to despite progressivism. I’m also sure most people aren’t on board with beheadings for apostasy, and cutting off the limbs of thieves. Now, as Dennis Michael Lynch reports, it’s clear what type of law (Sharia vs. American Law) many Muslims in America actually prefer. Fox News went to interview the Somalian Muslims on the streets of Cedar Riverside to learn the truth about how they really feel about living in America and American law. Every single one of them interviewed in the following video said they prefer Sharia law over American law.   “If you’re a Muslim, of course you want Sharia law,” they say. They believe it’s ok to kill someone if they insult Mohammad. They believe it’s perfectly normal to force their daughter to marry someone when she reaches the age of 15. When asked if they would prefer to live in America or Somalia, they say they would prefer Somalia. And the most stunning revelation of all is a young man at the end of the interview who admits, “I’m not Americanized, I just speak fluent and I an articulate what I’m trying to say, but as far as my culture and my preferences, I’m still Somalian.” Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com Fox News also featured another interview on the Cedar Riverside streets in May, where it was stated that they have at least two Islamic schools that teach Sharia law: Scary. These results are consistent with a poll of American Muslims conducted by the Center for Security Policy last year. It found that More than half (51%) of U.S. Muslims polled also believe either that they should have the choice of American or shariah courts, or that they should have their own tribunals to apply shariah. Only 39% of those polled said that Muslims in the U.S. should be subject to American courts. America is a tolerant nation – but that doesn’t mean we should tolerate the intolerance of Sharia. 
The Hillary Clinton staff dismissed State Department IT technician concerns over private server. Cheryl Mills, Hillary’s Chief of Staff said that other Secretaries of State had done it. As you remember, that was their excuse; everybody did it. Then they went on to say that Colin Powell endorsed it. The liberal mantra: Blame anyone, but don’t take responsibility. Read more below.  As Written By Katie Bo Williams for The Hill: The State Department technician who set up Hillary Clinton’s private server told FBI officials that he conveyed internal concerns that the setup violated federal record-keeping rules to Clinton’s “inner circle,” according to investigation notes released Friday afternoon. Bryan Pagliano told investigators that in 2009, two State IT specialists asked him whether he was aware of the clintonemail.com domain, then asked him to relay to Clinton’s team that the server could be a federal records retention issue. Pagliano conveyed the message to Cheryl Mills, Clinton’s chief of staff during her tenure as secretary of State. He told investigators that Mills replied that other secretaries of State had also used private email accounts, citing Colin Powell. The details come from 189 pages of notes from the FBI’s interviews with State officials, Clinton aides, IT technicians who worked on the server and others, released late Friday afternoon. The pages contain a few previously-unknown tidbits — including the revelation that Clinton at one point had a Gmail account, used so an unnamed aide could send her articles of interest to read. But the aide said he was “fairly sure” that the account was never used after it was …. Full Story Here: State IT official warned Clinton ‘inner circle’ about concerns with email setup | TheHill
This may be the biggest endorsement that GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump has gotten since the primary season ended. His biggest weakness with voters has long been his perceived lack of experience on foreign policy, which has been exacerbated by the foreign policy establishment’s general embrace of Hillary Clinton. While Clinton likely plans to pursue many of Barack Obama’s failed policies abroad, she has generally toed the foreign policy line that the political establishment has been parroting for years. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has taken a different tack on issues dealing with Russia, China, the Middle East, and Latin America. These differences have made it difficult for him to find supporters in the foreign policy community that could help him reassure voters. That’s no longer a problem. Former CIA Director R. James Woolsey, who was appointed and served under President Bill Clinton, came out this week and announced that he would be joining the Trump campaign and advising Mr. Trump on foreign policy. Woolsey said that he could not support Clinton because of her unwillingness to sacrifice her own self-interests and to safeguard our secrets. “She demonstrated a complete lack of understanding and an inability to lead the agency she headed in such a way as to maintain its mission and security,” Woolsey said in a statement. “Based on the emails thus far released we know that Secretary Clinton also lacks the ability to lead her senior managers while complying with and maintaining the basic protocols designed to protect our government’s sensitive and classified information. Mr. Trump understands the magnitude of the threats we face and is holding his cards close to the vest.”  Later in an interview with CNN, Woolsey cited Trump’s ability to safeguard our secrets (better than Clinton has) and his budget plans as reasons for throwing his support to Mr. Trump. “He seems to be, more so than his opponent, in favor of a strong defense budget. We’ve got a lot of space to make up and problems that have been left in defense by the Obama administration.”  Woolsey’s endorsement and advice may go a long way to helping Trump close the foreign policy gap that he’s thus far encountered with Hillary Clinton. Also, now that Woolsey has joined the team, one wonders if other foreign policy experts will begin lining up with Trump as well. With the debates around the corner, the Trump team certainly seems to be getting their political affairs in order, which can’t be welcome news for the Clinton campaign.

While the media is focused on the horserace that will help determine politics for the next eight years, theyâre pretty much ignoring the fact that Washington is still in business and Republicans are busy being Republicans, which is to say that the rich will be getting richer while everyone else will be getting poorer. Ryan, whoâs not sure he can back Donald Trump, likely because Trump dares say the things that Republicans generally say behind closed doors, has released a new domestic plan, called, âA Better Way.â Ryan calls it his antidote to anger and division. The only problem is that if anyone pays attention to the plan, they will be angry at how he divides Americans into tax brackets, and as usual, the top tax brackets win. His plan includes a lot of Republican staples, like more military, less regulation, repealing Obamacare and deep cuts for poor people. In other words, same old cold-hearted Ayn Rand âI got mine, now f*** youâ GOP themes. Perhaps the worst part, though, is the tax plan. There are a lot of tax cuts (mostly at the cost to poor people) and nearly all of those â 99.6 percent â go to the top one percent. A typical Republican tax cut will give about 40 percent of its tax cuts to the richest one percent. Ryanâs plan, according to a new analysis by the Tax Policy Center, will give three-quarters of its tax cuts to the richest one percent in the first year. And thatâs only because the cuts are slowly phased in. By 2025, the highest-earning one percent will enjoy 99.6 percent of the tax cuts. The remaining 0.4 percent will be divided up among the other 99 percent of the country. The new Paul Ryan tax cuts make the Bush tax cuts look like socialism.

Heâs just hoping we wonât notice. 
Conservative talk show host, author, and founder of The Blaze, Glenn Beck, a fervent supporter of Ted Cruz during the GOP presidential primary, put the Texas senator in the hot seat on Monday, grilling him over his shocking endorsement of Donald Trump announced on Friday. Beck, who is still firmly in the “Never Trump” camp, grilled Cruz from the beginning in an interview that no one will call “softball.” He started out by asking Cruz, who was calm and serious during the entire interview, how he could go from “vote your conscience” to now not only announcing that he’s voting for Donald Trump, but encouraging others to as well. “So am I now suppose to vote for him, or am I supposed to vote my conscience?” Beck asked, already showing a tone in his voice that expressed some disdain. “Well, Glenn, what I said in Cleveland and what I would say today is the same thing. You should follow your conscience. And I believe what I laid out in Cleveland was don’t stay home and vote your conscience and vote for candidates you trust to defend the Constitution. And what I was trying to do in Cleveland was lay out a path to uniting Republicans and lay out a path to winning. And in particular, I was saying to the Trump campaign — ‘This is how you earn my vote and I believe how you earn the vote of other conservatives — you defend freedom and defend the Constitution.’ This is about principles and ideas.”  When Ted Cruz began to explain how Hillary Clinton is certainly not the person to defend the Constitution, Glenn Beck interrupted, pointing out that we’ve known that “for 25 years,” and noted that when Cruz was asked over the weekend whether Donald Trump is fit to be president, he avoided directly answering the question. “What I said is this is a binary choice — I wish it were not a binary choice,” Cruz responded. “You know, I tried very, very hard, as did you, to prevent it from being a binary choice between Hillary and Donald Trump and I think it is fair to say there was no other Republican candidate who left more on the field and did more to stop Donald from being the nominee than I did. But the voters made a different decision and you have to respect the democratic process even if you may not be terribly happy with the outcome…” “So a man — I just want to make sure I understand — so a man who has principles who says, ‘There are lines I will not cross,’ it’s still a binary choice — so a man who you cannot come on and say, ‘Yes, Glenn, he is fit to be President of the United States,’ I still am encouraged by you to abandon my principles and vote because it’s a binary choice?” Beck asked, interrupting Cruz again. “You are encouraged by me to do what you believe is right and honorable and principled,” Cruz answered. “And from my perspective, as I look at the issues, Hillary Clinton is telling us she will do enormous damage to the country,” Cruz explained, bringing up issues like filling Supreme Court vacancies while stating that “every one of our constitutional rights hangs in the balance.” Glenn Beck said that Ted Cruz knew these things in July at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and had previously accused Donald Trump of being a “sociopathic liar” during the campaign and wondered how voters are now supposed to believe Trump when he takes positions on issues. “First of all, I have had many significant disagreements with Donald Trump, but as you noted I have not been shy to articulate those at considerable length. I don’t intend to do so at this point — the primary is over. We are in a general election with a binary choice and I don’t think it’s beneficial for me laying out those concerns,” Cruz answered. Again, Beck pressed, asking Cruz what changed between the convention and now to make Cruz change his mind when he could have done so at the convention. Ted Cruz explained that what changed for him was on Friday, the same day Cruz made his endorsement announcement, the Trump campaign guaranteed him that they would indeed pick from the list of potential Supreme Court nominees and also added Utah Senator Mike Lee , a principled constitutionalist, to the top of the list. “That was not an accident that that occurred,” Cruz told Beck. “When several weeks ago — when I sat down with Mike Pence in Washington — Mike asked me, ‘What would it take to get you on board?’ And for months, I had been telling Donald — I’ve been telling the campaign my greatest concern was protecting the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the rule of law. I told Donald that before the convention, I said that over and over and over again. And when we talked about, ‘Well, what could the campaign do to give any degree of reassurance on the Constitution and the rule of law, we discussed the Supreme Court as being one of the great checks protecting the Constitution and the rule of law. And the Trump campaign committing to nominate from that list was an important change that gave me significant reassurance that helped get me to the point of saying ‘yes.” Co-host Stu Burguiere then asked Cruz how he could possibly believe Trump’s word on the Supreme Court or anything else considering his well-documented history of being flimsy with the truth. Cruz answered by referring to his endorsement announcement on Facebook and explained that it was a decision that he “agonized about,” but that he knew with “one-hundred percent certainty” that Hillary Clinton would appoint “left-wing ideologues” to the Supreme Court and that the free speech, the right to bear arms and U.S. sovereignty would likely be eliminated. Cruz said that “he hoped” Trump would follow through on his commitment since he’s publicly promised to, but there is no way of knowing with certainty if anyone will keep their word. “The fact that he is publicly promising he will nominate from these 21, I think creates a dynamic where compared to Hillary who is promising to put left-wing ideologues, that’s a clear choice,” Cruz contended. Ted Cruz then explained that his much-ballyhooed speech in Cleveland was unfortunately perceived to mean he was “Never Trump,” but Cruz said that was not actually the case. He revealed that his speech drew upon convention speeches given previously by Ted Kennedy and Ronald Reagan during their primary challenges — speeches that were largely considered endorsements of their respective party’s eventual winner. After some contentious back-and-forth between Beck and his co-hosts, Cruz said that his goal of his convention speech was to move Trump closer to defending the Constitution and focus on the issues that matter to conservatives and that confirming that he would definitely pick from the Supreme Court list was pivotal as was Trump’s statement last week that he supported Cruz’s efforts to stop Obama’s Internet giveaway. “I was articulating, ‘If you want my vote, defend freedom and defend the Constitution,” Cruz said. “When Donald Trump comes in and supports our efforts to defend freedom, that’s significant. Does it mean that he will always do so in the future? No, I don’t have certainty of any candidate on that but what I do know is that what Hillary is promising to do would do enormous damage — the court would be lost for a generation. And the question of voting your conscience…listen, that is what I have struggled four months prayerfully considering what is the right thing to do.” Cruz went on to say that voters had five choices in regards to the presidential election, including voting third-party and not voting period, but that he could not publicly defend those choices because he was always “Never Hillary,” and the only path he sees to stop her presidency is to vote for Donald Trump. Glenn Beck, visibly angry, then skipped the commercial break, a break he said would cost him $20,000, but was well worth it to get in one more question with Cruz, which was to ask whether Cruz was selling an email list provided to him by Glenn Beck, to Donald Trump. Cruz answered that in the same way that Beck’s radio program sells advertising, Cruz — as does every other political campaign — rents their email lists to fund their efforts. He did not say specifically whether any such arrangement had been made with the Trump campaign but noted that there is a “hit piece” today by Politico, which he called a “left-wing rag,” that is applying a standard to him that they are not applying to any other politician. Beck concluded the interview by telling Cruz that he strongly disagreed with him on the issue of Trump but still respects him as a man. However, after the break, a disgruntled Beck suggested that perhaps he shouldn’t have supported the most principled conservative in the primary, but maybe should have supported Marco Rubio instead based upon him being able to defeat Hillary Clinton and forgiving his prior stance on illegal immigration and amnesty. “For the very first time I heard Ted Cruz calculate,” Beck said after the commercial break. “And when that happened, the whole thing fell apart for me,” he continued. “And it’s my fault. It’s my fault for believing that men can actually be George Washington.” WATCH full interview below via The Glenn Beck Program:     Email Subscribe
Donald Trump has a reputation in the media for being open and accessible to interview requests. He is known for a willingness to spout off to whoever sticks a microphone in front of his face, and it has helped him get this far as a political candidate. But lately, as Trump has hired new handlers and other assorted campaign personnel, he has also been in something of a retreat. That is, Trump is only talking to Fox News right now. Trump is saying âyesâ to Fox News almost every day but saying ânoâ to most other major networks and news organizations â a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee. He called into âFox & Friendsâ on Monday morning, he is booked on âThe OâReilly Factorâ Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday. Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidateâs exposure to hard-hitting questions â while fueling frustration among journalists. At Fox News, Trump can avoid pesky follow-up questions about his support for the racist birther conspiracy, long after he claims to have dropped it. Fox News hosts wonât ask him why he reacts to possible terrorism by screaming about how he was right, rather than express condolences for the victims and support for law enforcement. At Fox News, Trump isnât challenged â and thatâs the way he wants it. The problem is, wrapping up in the Fox News cocoon may feel good for the time being, but the way to win an election is to appeal to audiences outside of your base of comfort. Trump isnât reaching out. It is a strategy that shows up elsewhere in his campaign, where instead of following the model of successful politicians like George W. Bush and President Obama by holding campaign rallies in âswingâ districts hoping to persuade voters, Trump has rallies with the converted. On election day in 2012, Fox News viewers were shocked to find the Romney âlandslideâ the network had kept promoting was a harsh reality. They may be setting themselves up for a major failure. 
One of the biggest problems in arming the so-called “moderate” Syrian rebels to fight ISIS is that we truly don’t know who the moderates are. Just think of post cases where we’ve armed insurgents, such as the Mujahideen during the Cold War to fight the Russians – only to have many of them later morph into Al-Qaeda and The Taliban.  The same is true of the so-called moderates in Syria. A video went viral last month of one such “moderate” group of rebels beheading a 12 year old boy, which I won’t link to for obvious reasons – and how many other groups have members who would do the same? Most of the dozens of groups fighting in the Syrian Civil War have some sort of ideological motivation, and even “moderate” Muslims could change their tune when they have the power to influence government. It’s too late now though, as the House voted to arm Syrian rebels back in 2014, and John McCain was a huge proponent of it. And how is that working out? Let’s take a peak… As WeaselZippers reported: Video footage appears to show US commandos fleeing a Syrian town under a barrage of abuse and insults hurled at them by fighters from the American-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebel group. The video appears to be the first evidence of US special forces cooperating with Turkish troops in their battle against Islamic State (Isil). The incident illustrates the complex web of alliances and enmities in Syria, where many of America’s allies are fighting each other and some rebel groups that receive US support still harbour strong anti-American sentiments. The footage shows a crowd of rebel fighters in the town of al-Rai near the Turkish border, which was captured from Isil by Syrian rebel groups with the backing of Turkey. Turkey, which launched a military incursion into Syria in late August, has been backing the FSA. The fighters scream anti-American chants as a column of pick-up trucks carrying US commandos drives away from them. “Christians and Americans have no place among us,” shouts one man in the video. “They want to wage a crusader war to occupy Syria.” Another man calls out: “The collaborators of America are dogs and pigs. They wage a crusader war against Syria and Islam. ” The US troops are not wearing traditional uniform but they carry American weapons and are wearing the distinctive round helmets favoured by US special forces. Two days ago, the U.S. admitted that we may have possibly accidentally bombed Syrian forces in an airstrike that was meant for ISIS. However, when Syrian forces (who are supposed to be our allies) are threatening us, could that strike have been intentional, and we just claimed it was meant for ISIS as cover up? Just when you thought the Syrian Civil War couldn’t get even more complicated, it did. 
Just a couple of weeks ago Loretta Lynn fell before a concert and doctors said that she would have to undergo surgery because of the injuries. Loretta Lynn was forced to postpone her upcoming concerts after the country legend fell before her big Labor Day Concert. The fall was a serious fall and Loretta was suffering from several injuries. Heartbroken that she couldn’t be with her fans she posted a thank you to everyone for their understanding. “I thank you all for coming, and I’m sorry I can’t be there with you. I’ve fallen, and I can’t get up. I injured my chest and can’t get a deep enough breath to sing, but I’ll update you Monday [Sept. 5] after I see the doctor.”  Unfortunately, things only got worse from there. Just a week or so ago Loretta Lynn announced that she was going to have to have surgery. Her website posted the update and fans were heartbroken that Loretta was going to have to go through all of this. “American country music legend Loretta Lynn is at home recuperating from a recent fall that left her unable to perform on Labor Day weekend at her ranch in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee. Although her injuries are not serious, she will be undergoing minor surgery and Loretta’s doctors have advised her to stay off the road until she’s made a full recovery.” NOW she just released another announcement and it was what fans never expected. Just a couple of months after her fall Loretta is going to be releasing her new Christmas album “White Christmas Blue”. The album is going to be a 12 track album that will also feature new studio performances of several classic Christmas songs.  Check out the songs below: 1. “White Christmas Blue” 2. “Country Christmas” 3. “Winter Wonderland” 4. “Away in a Manger” 5. “Blue Christmas” 6. “To Heck With Ole Santa Claus” 7. “Frosty the Snowman” 8. “Oh Come, All Ye Faithful” 9. “Jingle Bells” 10. “White Christmas” 11. “Silent Night” 12. “‘Twas the Night Before Christmas” We are so thrilled to hear that Loretta is going to be releasing a new album. It seemed like things were going downhill for the country singer, but thankfully now things are starting to look up! This is going to be so good! Please continue to pray for Loretta to have a quick recovery so she can be back out on the stage!  Congrats on your new album, WE LOVE YOU LORETTA LYNN!
Terence Crutcher was shot and killed on Sept. 16 in an officer-involved shooting in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Since then, the media have tried to push a false narrative that Crutcher had his hands up when he was shot — but video evidence, as it often does in these cases, disproved the media’s theory. There’s also more information that the mainstream media conveniently left out. Crutcher had a hefty criminal record before he was shot. In fact, he had just been released in May after nine years in prison for drug trafficking, WZ reported. He also had a history of resisting arrest. Behold the rap sheet: 1996 Shooting with intent to kill — Dismissed 2001 Petit larceny — Conviction 2004 Driving while suspended — Conviction 2005 Driving while suspended, resisting officer — Conviction 2006 Driving while suspended — Conviction Driving with open container — Dismissed 2006 Trafficking in illegal drugs — Conviction. (He was also charged in that incident with assault on a police officer and resisting, but that was dismissed.) 2011 Public intoxication (while in prison for drug trafficking) — Conviction 2012 Public intoxication — Conviction Obstructing an officer — Conviction 2013 DUI — Conviction Resisting officer — Conviction Open Container — Conviction Failure to wear seatbelt — Conviction Speeding — Conviction But even all of that was not all. Take a look at the numerous open warrants for Crutcher. These Aug. 30 warrants were active at the time of his death, and as you can see in the graphic below, they included things like DUI, resisting, drug trafficking and public intoxication.  The media are actively pushing the narrative that Crutcher had his hands up and that the police shot him anyway. We’ve heard this lie peddled by the media before, in the Michael Brown case, and clearly the obtuse media didn’t learn a thing. Helicopter video footage of Crutcher’s altercation with police has surfaced. Take a look:  Now, you watch that video and listen to the commentary. Did it look to you like Crutcher was following commands? You can hear an officer say that Crutcher was “still walking” and that he wasn’t “following commands.” Another officer said that he “could be on something.” Take a look at these pictures Bearing Arms grabbed from the video that disprove the media’s false narrative:       As you can see, Crutcher was not shot with his hands up. He was clearly flouting officer orders, and at the time of his shooting he lowered his right hand toward his waistband. Oh, and by the way, the media have run with the story that Crutcher was unarmed, but didn’t seem too interested in the PCP that was found in his car and that the Tulsa Police Department officer who shot Crutcher, Betty Shelby, was trained to spot PCP abuse, according to Bearing Arms. In any of these cases, the legal system should be given time to do its job, but the media have decided to run false narratives that fit their agenda without all the facts and, in some cases, despite the facts. As you can see above, there’s clearly more to the story. Please share this on Facebook and Twitter if you agree that the mainstream media use cases like this to bolster their divisive and dangerous agenda against law enforcement. What's your take on the Crutcher case and the mainstream media's attempt to push a false narrative? Scroll down to comment below!

While Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are using the Brussels attack to foment Islamophobia amongst their respective bases, it’s important to note that white terrorists have killed more Americans on U.S. soil than Muslim terrorists since the 9/11 attacks. The New America Foundation (NAF), a think tank funded by prominent universities and foundations, has been keeping track of all terrorist attacks on American soil since 9/11, and found that not only have white terrorists killed more Americans than jihadists, but attacks by white terrorists are also twice as frequent, with 18 homegrown terror attacks between 2004 and 2015, and just 9 terror attacks rooted in Islamic extremist ideology. To define what constitutes a terrorist, NAF has very specific criteria: The purpose of this database is to provide as much information as possible about American citizens and permanent residents engaged in violent extremist activity as well as individuals, regardless of their citizenship status, living within the United States who have engaged in violent extremist activity. We examine both those individuals motivated by Jihadist ideology, understood as those who worked with or were inspired by al-Qaeda and its affiliated groups, as well as those motivated by other ideologies that are non-Jihadist in character, for example right wing, left wing, or idiosyncratic beliefs. NAF’s list of terrorist attacks since September 11, 2001 includes 9 attacks led by jihadists, which have killed 45 people — the most recent attack being the San Bernardino shooting in December that killed 14 and wounded 21 — and 18 attacks by American right-wing extremists that killed 48 people. Most notably, while there were zero terror attacks on U.S. soil by Islamic extremists between June 2, 2009 and April 14, 2013, there were eight attacks by right-wing extremists in that time frame. The most deadly of those attacks was the Sikh temple shooting in Wisconsin in 2012, which left six dead and four wounded. But despite the frequency and brutality of white terror attacks, there are far more Muslim terrorists prosecuted and/or killed for their crimes in 11 of the 15 years studied. As the chart below shows, the only years between 2001 and 2015 where non-jihadist terrorists were indicted or killed for their crimes more than their jihadist counterparts were 2001, 2004, 2008, and 2012: Data from the New America Foundation Additional data shows that while jihadists were diverse in ethnicity, an overwhelming majority of American terrorists were white. Out of 182 total non-jihadist perpetrators of terror attacks in the US between 2001 and 2015, 165 were white. And while Trump is proposing an outright ban on Muslims entering the US as a way to combat terrorism, he ignores the fact that a vast majority of terrorists, both right-wing and Islamic, are American-born citizens: Data from the New America Foundation What these numbers show is that there is no catch-all solution to stop extremist terrorism. But it’s evident that simply profiling Muslims and treating all new immigrants as potential jihadists is both discriminatory and counterproductive.      
To anyone paying attention last night it was clear that Hillary did not win the debate against Trump. Sure, Trump was brash and he’s not your normal politician, but the fact of the matter is he demolished her on her record in front of the entire country. Nevertheless, CNN did their best to make it look like Trump lost the debate by publishing rigged polling data. From Infowars: A CNN/ORC poll released shortly after last night’s debate found that Hillary Clinton scored a clear victory over her rival Donald Trump. One problem – the survey sample included 41% Democrats compared to just 26% Republicans. Asked, “Who do you think did the best job in the debate – Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?”, 62% of respondents said Hillary while 27% said Trump. This immediately gave the impression that Hillary trounced Trump in the debate, and set the standard for the media narrative that it was a bad night for the Republican candidate. However, 33% of the people surveyed in the poll identified as Independents, 41% identified as Democrats, while just 26% identified as Republicans. This represents a disparity of 15% between Democrats and Republicans – meaning the poll was heavily weighted in favor of Democrats before the question about who won the debate was even asked.  Almost three quarters of the respondents were not Republicans and 57% more Democrats were asked than Republicans. If the sampling was flipped, with 41% of respondents being Republican and just 26% identifying as Democrats, the outcome would almost certainly have been in Trump’s favor.              I think you get the point by now…Donald crushed Hillary in last night’s debate! 
If you’re like me, you are eagerly awaiting the Donald Trump – Hillary Clinton debate. Don’t get me wrong – as a policy nerd, I am disheartened to see that America has embraced two candidates who rely hardly at all on policy discussions.   Trump advances himself through no-nonsense rhetoric aimed at Americans who are very understandably frustrated with the current culture of political correctness and weakness that permeates every branch of government. Hillary advances herself through lies, extortion and skillfully-crafted propaganda designed to hold out just long enough to dupe the American people into giving the unindicted felon a job promotion. Still, the debate should be entertaining as Hillary has a habit of melting-down when on-the-spot and Trump thrives off of pushing back against unfair assertions and unwarranted attacks. To emphasize how this debate is likely to be different, consider how Trump would have handled Candy Crowley’s shameful advocacy she pushed in 2012’s debate. As if going against Trump isn’t scary enough, Hillary is riding into the debate on a wave of ever-dropping polls. Most polls have had Hillary up considerably over Trump since the conclusion of the primaries. Then again, these polls have largely been rigged via selection bias and targeted samplings of respondents. The Real Clear Politics average (which averages the results of dozens of polls) has Hillary up by a measly 2.1%. When we account for the “bias factor,” we can see that at best, Hillary is dead even with Trump. The projections emerging from the polls indicate that given the downward trend Hillary is suffering, Trump is only a single state away from victory in November. That means a lot can change. The data is having an effect on even the most optimistic analysts. FiveThirtyEight has placed Hillary’s chance of winning declining from 70.6 percent on September 11th, to 56.8 percent on September 20th. While polls are becoming more and more meaningless (look at Karl Rove and his little whiteboard), the empirical reality is that Americans are souring on Hillary the more they learn about her whereas people decided on Trump ages ago. Many mistakenly believe that this is a two-person race. It’s not. It’s a race between Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and “none of the above.” Those who support Trump have supported him for quite some time. They’re dedicated and view him as an agent of change. Those who vehemently support far-left policies are still embittered by the railroading of Bernie Sanders and these vote do not necessarily translate to votes for Hillary. In a direct, forced match-up between Hillary and Trump, it may be extremely tight. However, how many Democrats are just going to stay home rather than risk the embarrassment of having voted for Hillary? An even better question: if Hillary cannot stand up to Trump in a debate, will that finally demonstrate to liberals the validity of what Trump has been saying all along? That she is too weak to stand for America at a time when our prestige is slipping on the international stage? 
With yet two bombings and stabbings being committed within a 12-hour span, America has been reminded that we are the target of both homegrown hatred and the fanatical cult-like fallowing of a medieval ‘religion’. As expected, the two candidates running for office gave their comments on the matter..  But it was only one that really caught the attention of the media and not for what was said, but rather how it was delivered. Hillary Clinton used her response to a New York City bombing Saturday night to yet again take a swing at Donald Trump, but opponents and the media wondered if she was swinging while she was under the influence of something else. A tranquilized-sounding Clinton looked as if she was dazed out of her mind, as well as looking as if she was about to drop over and fall asleep. She spoke with the media pool that have been following her around on the campaign: “I’ve been briefed about the bombings in New York and New Jersey and the attack in Minnesota. Obviously we need to do everything we can to support our first responders, I’ll have more to say about it when we actually know some facts.” As she was giving her take, a reporter asked about Donald Trump’s reply and if she had any further comment on it. “I think it’s important to know the facts about any incident like this. That’s why it’s critical to support the first responders, the investigators who are looking into it trying to determine what did happen. I think it’s also wiser to wait until you have information before making conclusions because we are just in the beginning stages of trying to determine what happened,” she said. Twitter has gone crazy over the interview, with many followers saying they believed Clinton was either drugged up, or she just didn’t have the energy to wake herself up in a time of need. Either, or – it’s not Presidential material.  Is she highly medicated or what??

Liberals like to talk about the secret figures funding the Republican party, but they have one of their own. George Soros has been funding leftist groups for decades, from Occupy Wall Street to Black Lives Matter. Rumors of voter fraud have followed him for a long time and it appears that he’s gearing up to do it again. A new campaign has debuted that claims it will end Trump’s campaign. Called the “October surprise that will end Trump,” the campaign says it will activate a “secret swing state” of over 8 million unregistered voters abroad, made up of both American expats and “global citizens.”  The 8 million Americans abroad almost never vote. This dead easy tool can fix that but only if we make it famous: https://t.co/z4l7lekdub — Avaaz (@Avaaz) September 13, 2016   Interestingly, the campaign wasn’t launched in the United States, but in London. Avaaz is a registered charity in the United States and is also one of the world’s most powerful activist groups — and, surprise!, has links to George Soros. The activists behind the campaign drove from University College London to Parliament in an open top bus, blasting Bruce Springsteen’s “Born in the USA” while yelling “Don’t vote Trump!”.   It is illegal in the United States for registered charities to work with or for any presidential candidate, and Avaaz denies having any connection to the Hillary Clinton campaign. They were recorded yelling “Vote for Hillary!”, though. “Avaaz has created the world’s first, global, citizen’s get-out-the-vote drive,” a member of Avaaz explained. “The more people that share it on Facebook, the more Americans abroad will see it, and the more we will be able to stop the global threat of Trump.”  The view for the top of the @Avaaz Stop Trump battle bus in London. American music, balloons, flags & chanting @LBC pic.twitter.com/slsTFdQti3 — Rachael Venables (@rachaelvenables) September 21, 2016   Avaaz chose to kick off their campaign in London because it has the largest concentration of American expats and created a new tool designed to show them how easy it was to register to vote. 88% of Americans living overseas did not register to vote in the last presidential election and Avaaz believes that this voting bloc would be mostly progressive. Over half of American expats in the United Kingdom have Master’s degrees and overwhelmingly donate to Democratic candidates. But it’s not just Americans living in Europe they’re reaching out to — their next campaign is in Mexico.  1 million Americans in Mexico can stop #Trump's wall! #GringosAVotar campaign kicks off Sun 9/25 in Mexico City: https://t.co/Q68FjjJk7d pic.twitter.com/6tv7CES8Cy — Avaaz (@Avaaz) September 21, 2016   Will the Soros machine be able to stop the Trump campaign’s momentum? 
A note from our resident cartoonist A.F. Branco: Sadly, a painful and horrific nightmare was inflicted on my community last night when a supposed lone shooter (still at large) shot and killed 5 people at the Cascade Mall in Burlington, Washington last night. This is a place where my wife and I routinely shop and go to the movies. My wife’s brother and niece were in the mall when the chaos started. Another close relative was working in Macy’s along with other close relatives in the mall at the time of the shooting. They were all evacuated to safety without harm. While we are relieved and so grateful that they all made it back to their homes safely last night, our hearts are extremely heavy and go out to those who were lost last night and to their families in this senseless act of violence. Please pray for our community during this incredibly difficult time. Please also pray for our first responders and the law enforcement officers that are still trying to find this person. A.F.

Hillary Clinton appeared on Steve Harvey on Tuesday and expressed the feeling that she wanted to be instrumental in improving policing tactics in the United States. Specifically she was referencing the recent shooting of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma by a white female police officer. It is now dominating the news as leftists and Black Lives Matter activists are simultaneously going crazy. She said, “How many times do we have to see this in our country? This is unbearable and it needs to be intolerable. Maybe I can, by speaking directly to white people [and] say, ‘Look this is not who we are.’ We’ve got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias. We can do better. We have got to rein in what is absolutely inexplicable.” It is funny how she almost appears to be endorsing the idea that African American people are unjustly oppressed and discriminated against in the United States. Black people often say that one black person is not representative of the entire African American race. Yet, she thinks that as a white woman she can speak for all white people? That is pretty ignorant. Not even considering the fact that more people in her party like Senator Bernie Sanders than her. Crutcher’s family released the violent video of his death at the hands of a police officer on Tuesday. The Tulsa Police Chief said to the media during a press conference that no firearm was found at the scene of the shooting. The police officer indicated she shot Crutcher because he motioned his hand into the car as if to grab something which she had believed was a firearm. Which would seem to corroborate the belief that Crutcher was unarmed and not a danger to the police officers. To think that all one needs to do is “talk to white people” in order to quell the issue of systemic racism or brutality against African Americans is absolutely ludicrous. You would think that for a seasoned politician Clinton would understand that it is actions and not words that effect real change. But Clinton is usually all talk and no walk. Considering the fact she changes her opinions on issues as quickly as the cash from private lobbyists and Wall Street backers is created. 
Colin Kaepernick’s refusal to stand for the national anthem has permeated professional and now youth sports. Everyone is taking sides and it is not pretty. Many feel it is disrespectful to veterans to not stand while others view it as a meaningful protest to bring attention to what they call the oppression of African American people. Now a Navy Sailor came forward via social media to make a statement about the protests that many will not like. The Independent Journal Review reported, “Last week, as tensions increased following two highly publicized police shootings, another sailor came forward to say that she would be sitting out the national anthem as well.” Read her statement and look at her picture below that she posted to Facebook.   She indicates in her little statement that she was punished simply for defending the constitution but that is false. She was punished for violating Navy regulations. Regulations that she is well aware of. Navy regulations indicate that all uniformed personnel must stand at attention towards the ensign when the national anthem is played. It is the military after all. When that regulation is violated then a disciplinary action can be taken. While having the right to do something allows you to that doesn’t mean you are immune from punishment. As is the case here. She had the right to do it, but she was punished because she broke the rules of the pledge she took when she enlisted into the Navy. One felbow Navyman Martin Baker noted that in basic training they are taught their duty is to preserve and defend freedom and the constitution not practice it. He is also an African American. While Ervin has preserved and defended freedom she is not within her rights to practice it. Is that fair? Maybe it is, maybe it isn’t. But that is what she signed up for so she shouldn’t be complaining about it now when she knew what she was getting herself into. 
Chapter II from my book The Trump Revolution (available at Amazon) Read Chapter I here. The Dishonorable Businessmen! The Elite! Before I start whipping the corrupt, dishonorable business men, I want to note two points: The first point, this book is written from the point of view of a Capitalist who believes in honorable businessmen who, in turn, are responsible for building the country, and employing its people. With the “country,” I mean America, not China or Mexico. The second point, I can hear someone saying Trump is a businessman and he is from the elite. Let me say something. When you play a sport and you want to be successful you follow the rules that are set for the game, even if you don’t like them. However, if you head the federation of that sport, you would have a chance to change the rules that you do not believe in. Now we are ready for the whipping. The elite of this country, a group of very rich businessmen. They own almost everything including the media and the politicians. You can even call them the neo-lords. Let’s tell an old story that we all know to see where the neo-lords emerged from. America is the land of the free. The peasants fled Europe from the oppression of their lords, the hunger, the illness, etc. They fled to America to live as free farmers, until the neo-lords grew again in the land of the free. At the old time, the lord was the owner and the ruler. Now, the neo-lords, who are the elite businessmen, are the owners and they own the rulers, the politicians shall we say. They even went further, and decided to own the minds and hearts of the people, so they decided to own the media and they even penetrated the churches. The lord-peasant system found its way again to the land of the free. The system developed. After a struggle, the American People adapted to the new system and forced their elite businessmen to adapt to the idea that they are dealing with free people. The elite businessmen uncomfortable with the idea that the American People are not peasants enough, they decided to leave to where they can find real peasants. They got their bought-off politicians to sign a couple of regional and international free trade agreements. The factories moved to China, Mexico and other countries as a consequence. Apparently, the elite-businessmen found that their multi-billion dollars are not big enough fortune, so they moved to China to make an extra couple of billions of dollars on cheap labor. Probably, they were afraid that their children might starve and they need an extra couple of billions to make sure they are full. In the transition, they are using America as a market, a dwindling market. It shrinks as more and more factories are closing and moving abroad. Consequently, more and more workers are laid off. And so, less shoppers and buyers. An economy cannot be sustained by the people selling services to each other and producing nothing. The elite-businessmen are milking the cows to the last drop and slaughtering them one after one. Quite like the lords in the earlier history, when they are fed-up with a town and the people are harder to rule; they pillage it, burn it and move to another town to start again. That is what the corrupt elite of the United States’ businessmen are doing. They use their politicians and their media to get the job done. The corruption prevailed, but the free Americans figured out that there is something wrong and they started to revolt. They did not know where to start and what to do, so Donald Trump jumped in and decided to lead them. Stand Up America, The Leader Is Here. So how should an honorable businessman be? The businessman is a career. Like any career, it has its duties and its ethics. So what are the duties? The businessman’s job is building the elements of the economy of the country using his special abilities; like his skills, knowledge, personal character etc. He has to take part in building the country. He has to be involved in forming and executing plans to develop the country. Before and after these, he is responsible for employing the people of his country and getting the best out of them. To accomplish that, he has to socially secure the lives of the workers to make them feel that the time and effort are worth giving. For the businessman to achieve this goal, he has to watch for the health of his workers, physical, mental and psychological. What I mentioned are not newly innovated ideas. Many companies are famous for their “good benefits and pay.” That’s what a businessman is supposed to do. What are our elite-businessmen doing? They are shutting factories’ doors, they lay off workers and they move the factories to other countries. Then, they force the people of the United States to buy the products of the factories they moved to the other countries!!! I hate to be sarcastic, but “what a patriotic and responsible action.” I can hear them murmuring: “hmm…….   The workers have to help themselves, to stand for themselves hmm…..” Congratulations for increasing your profits greedy Blood Suckers. Imagine that all the American medical doctors decided to close the hospitals and to move them to another countries. So, to make more money, they leave the American patients to stand for themselves. Imagine if a man decided to abandon his family for a rich woman leaving his wife and children to stand for themselves. What are the nationalities of these gluttonous misers? Could they have closed the factories without buying the politicians? The answer is no. Could they have done this without a cover-up from their media? The answer is no. Selfishness, greed. I would say treason. The elite-businessmen formed an alliance against Donald Trump, why? He is the only politician who stood up and spoke out about getting the factories back to America. Don’t believe those who started to hijack his ideas after almost a year of campaigning, they found themselves loosing. They will not touch this subject when they get the presidency. They are just elite-businessmen’s pawns. If they believe in getting the factories back, they would not have waited that long to mention it during their campaigns. They just found themselves loosing. The elite-businessmen’s media Here we are talking about all of what is called the mainstream media. Most all the news channels owned by the elite-businessmen. Trump should be proud they are all against him. Have you ever seen any other candidate being grilled by them like they grill Trump? They pressure Trump as hard as they can then they catch any of his tongue-slips. They make stories and they keep wailing and screaming about these tongue-slips non-stop!!! What should the job of the media be? Showing the people the truth about what is happening. Displaying the real problems facing the people according to the people’s priorities. Explaining what is being plotted against them. That is what they are supposed to do. But, what are they really doing? Tranquilizing the people by dragging their attention to anything other than their real life problems. Entertaining the people and making them laugh and enjoy their life while the country is being set on fire. WAKE UP AMERICA!!! Have you ever seen CNN and her sister channels going with their cameras to show the closed, abandoned factories? Have you ever seen them roaming with their cameras in the streets of abandoned ghost towns? Did they interview laid off workers or the abused Walmart workers who are even being replaced by machines. Have they shown all of that on their screens? But you know what? We are on the move, and we found a father, a leader who is listening to us, and speaks and acts on our behalf. Stand Up America, The Leader Is Here. The elite-businessmen’s politicians Welcome to the employees of the elite-businessmen. They call them Senators, Representatives and even Presidents. They belong to two owned companies that are called political parties: Republicans and Democrats. Most of these politicians in the last 50 years are bought and sold. They are playing a game they call an election. The rule of the game; let the people get indulged in ideological battles, conservatives against liberals but make sure they don’t break free from the exploitation of the elite-businessmen. It does not matter who wins, the factories were sent and being sent abroad by Republican presidents, Democratic presidents, Republican Congress, Democratic Congress etc. Were the people asked to approve or disapprove the free trade agreements? I mean were these agreements among the issues the candidates were talking about in their election campaigns before they signed them? The people are only allowed to make the country 5% more conservative or 5% more liberal. It looks like Trump is taking it far away, beyond what the people are allowed to change. Let me recite a scenario that would show how a catastrophic decision would be taken behind the people’s backs: The elite-businessmen speaking to a to-be-president: You look like you can make a good president… You are smart or else we wouldn’t have approached you… We will make you president in return for a favor……. We want you to do so and so…. If you don’t follow, we will destroy you….No second term…..and/ or big scandal…. You get us angry and you are a dead dog…. End of the scenario. It is literally a deal with the devil. They ask the politician for a catastrophic decision that feeds their greed and harm the people. Listen Greedy-Hearts, no more of these dirty tricks. Stand up, America. Donald J. Trump is here.

Just days after the University of North Dakota (UND) was nationally embarrassed over a student’s racist snap, the college is in hot water once again. In another Snapchat post that could potentially damage the university’s reputation and recruitment efforts for African American students, a group of white female students are seen wearing blackface, with the caption “Black Lives Matter.”  The snap was discovered just over 24 hours after a previous snap that three white female students posted after stealing an African American roommate’s phone and locking her out of her dorm room. In that post, three white female students are all smiling, and the caption on the photo reads, “Locked the black bitch out!”  While the university has already opened an investigation into the first photo, University of North Dakota Mark Kennedy said the second racist social media post in two days shows that the school has a lot of work to do to educate students on diversity, inclusion, and respect for others. In a public statement issued Friday evening, Kennedy said he will personally undertake an endeavor to build out a diversity education initiative for UND students. I have been disappointed to learn that we have people in our university community who don’t know that the kind of behavior and messaging demonstrated in these two photos is not ok, and that, in fact, it is inexcusable. Our mission is educational in nature. Our student conduct process is educational in nature. This is our opportunity to provide an education to all members of our campus community, especially those who may not understand the gravity of their actions. Based upon my conversations with students and others, I can assure you that the messages of the two photos are painful to many individuals. I have heard from many within our campus community, as well as alums and individuals not directly connected to the University, who are encouraging us to use this situation as an opportunity to address what some see as long standing issues within our community and across the country. We must demand better of ourselves and our university community. I am directing my team to explore best practices for diversity education amongst premier institutions and will work collaboratively with the AVP for Diversity and Inclusion and University Senate to bring it to reality at UND. As of this writing, the students in the photo have not been publicly named.        
In less than 48 hours, over the course of this past weekend, 22 people have been shot, two fatally, in the city of Chicago. This, only days after Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s speech on violence in which he proposed more police and mentoring programs for “at risk youth”, meaning those who are doing the killing. The only people at risk are the innocent citizens on the wrong end of the Windy City’s gangster’s guns. These thugs and killers are not “at risk”. They have already plunged to the depths of thuggery and evil. Hey Mayor, how about some programs for those who are truly at risk, the law abiding people of your city. How about a “program” that starts arresting and prosecuting thugs with illegal guns? We know Chicago is a gun free heavenly haven, right? Wrong. There are more guns in Chicago than in many third world nations. And speaking of third world nations, that’s what it’s like to live in the life or death neighborhoods of Chicago.   The Mayor is calling for more police. And yet police are being maligned, killed, shot at, protested against and generally disrespected by the very people you are trying to help by sending them in. Get control of the gangsters and thugs in your city with a seriously tough anti-crime initiative like Mayor Giuliani did in New York during his term and watch the homicide rate start dropping. But words mean nothing when a six year-old girl is hit by gangster gunfire and someone’s cousin walking her three month-old loses her life merely by leaving the house. Mayor Emanuel, your city will know you are serious when fewer people die. You are crying on stage, while the people are dying in the streets. Seems inappropriate not to mention useless. Do something Mr. Mayor. We’re waiting. Emanuel’s full speech below:   
Fake Fox News journalist Sean Hannity might be one of the golden boys at Fox News Channel, but he’s definitely going in the dog house after the stunt he pulled. Along with a handful of rednecks and hicks, Hannity and other conservative figures appeared in a ridiculously bad video called “#HEARTLAND4TRUMP.” The right-wing video was released on Trump’s official YouTube page over the weekend. “One of the reasons I’m supporting Donald Trump this year is, number one, he’s gonna put originalists on the Supreme Court, people that believe in fidelity to the Constitution, separation of powers, co-equal branches of government. He’s a guy who will vet refugees to keep Americans safe,” he says in the ad. And proving once again that he’s an ill-informed hack who sucks up to anyone willing to pay him to spew their fact free crap, Hannity offered full-throated support for Trump’s luxurious border wall (not going to happen). “And of course he’s going to build that wall,” Hannity continued. “He says he’s going to have Mexico pay for it, that’s fine, as long as we secure the country. And of course, we don’t want people competing for jobs.” It seems Hannity pissed off the higher-ups when he didn’t inform them that he was making a promotional video for the Donald Trump campaign. “We were not aware of Sean Hannity participating in a promotional video, and he will not be doing anything along these lines for the remainder of the election season,” Fox told the Daily Beast when they found out. We always deride Fox News for its ludicrous “Fair and Balanced” slogan, but never before have we seen propaganda quite like Hannity’s participation in the Trump campaign. Even Fox seems shocked by how obsessed their host is with Trump. When Fox is telling its pundits to cool it on the Trump worship, you know it’s reached embarrassing levels. Watch the ridiculous ad below: Featured image via screen capture  Someone gave us a visual for the ages. Now if we could just fill it up with kitty litter. Used kitty litter.
A senior member of the CongressionalÂ Black Caucus stepped up to a lectern on the House Floor on Thursday and listed all the innocent activities that can be a death sentence for African-Americans. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), armed with a variety of props, depicted all the things that can cause black people in the United States to be killed at the hands of law enforcement because they are viewed with suspicion,Â even when engaging in harmless activities. âEach time we lose a precious life to fear, distress, and prejudice, the list of things that will get you killed as a black person in America gets a little longer,â Lee said. Among the items she held up were: âShould any of this warrant a death sentence? Is this the America you want to live in?â Lee asked. Lee said that when her sons were young she had âtough conversationsâ with them, warning them to be careful in their interactions with the very same police officers who are sworn to serve and protect them. âSince Michael Brown was shot in Ferguson two years ago, 2,195 people have been killed by police in our nation. As the mother of two black men and the grandmother of five black grandchildren, I worry that someone I love could become number 2,196,â she said. The issue of fatal police shootings of African-Americans has come to the forefront again after three more killings rocked the nation.Â Tyre King, a teenager with a BB gun, was killed in Columbus, Ohio; Terence Crutcher, who had his hands in the air, was killed in Tulsa, Okla.; and Keith Lamont Scott, who was reading a book in his car, was killed in Charlotte, N.C. As a result, protesters have once again flooded onto the streets of America. WatchÂ Rep. Barbara Lee address the House, here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoGdX5sFU2I] 
Hillary Clinton missed a fundraiser in North Carolina. The campaign says the event was “postponed.” However the fact is she MISSED the biggest thing that people running from political office do: fundraise Sure, Hillary Clinton has a lot of ill-gotten Haitian money. But by Trump standards she’s still “dead broke.” Therefore, her absence from a fundraiser suggests something is afoot. The campaign gave no reason for her absence, yet Hillary is not campaigning either. We don’t expect an explanation for that either. The event was to be in Chapel Hill, and some of the wealthiest Democrats in the state were prepared to buy access. According to CBS North Carolina, the even to take place at the home of Betty Craven and Michael Warner. It was billed as: “Lunch with Hillary Rodham Clinton.” Costs ranged from $2,700 to $100,000. In case you caught Hillary Clinton on Jimmy Fallon on Monday, that was previously taped in New York on Friday, less than a week after Hillary got the clean bill of health. As her doctor put it, Hillary is “fit to lead.” Nevertheless, we could find nothing on Clinton’s campaign strategy for today. I ask again, “Where’s Waldo?”     
When Donald Trump talks about America, he often talks about how we don’t “win anymore.” We don’t win on manufacturing. We don’t win on trade. We don’t win on economics. We don’t win against ISIS. It’s that last point I wish to address, because Trump said at a recent rally: “Our military can’t beat ISIS. Can you imagine the great General Douglas MacArthur or the great General George Patton saying we can’t beat ISIS. Patton would rip your heart out if you ever said that. We can’t beat – right? Can you imagine that though? Can you imagine what – they’re spinning right now. They’re watching. They’re spinning in their grave.” You, Donnie Trump, go on, and speak like MacArthur and Patton talk to you. You sound like you’ve assured them you can win here, and you’ll do them proud. Is that how you see it, Donnie? You’re ignoring an awful lot there, Donnie. Neither MacArthur nor Patton behaved the way you do. They were tacticians, not juggernauts who rolled to victory in every single engagement. They knew when to steamroll, and when to pull back and regroup. In your crusade against anything that even remotely looks like weakness, you’ve taught your dense and idiotic followers that winning against ISIS is as simple as a football game. Simply act like we can win, and we’ll win. I’m sure that our dear Mr. Trump does not see anything wrong with talking this way. After all, nothing he ever does is wrong. Period. End of. However, the problem is not how he sees it. The problem is the message he’s putting forth. He’s treating war, and terrorism, like they’re football games. If we just think positively, believe we can win, and stop acting like we can’t beat ISIS, we’ll beat them handily. That’s not true. Generals Patton and MacArthur were so successful in part because they were realistic. There were massive failures during WWII. We did not ride in on this white horse to save the day. However, Donnie disgustingly buys into that very narrative. We didn’t. MacArthur was already in the Philippines when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. In the ensuing months, he suffered grievous defeats. He actually ordered a withdrawal to Australia to regroup. He was human. His troops were human. Japan was a juggernaut at the time, and we couldn’t beat them with brute force. What do you think of that, Donnie? MacArthur actually a Isn’t that giving up? Isn’t that what you’re railing against? MacArthur is remembered as great of things like this. Not in spite of them, and definitely not because they didn’t happen. Then there’s Patton. He does seem to have been more the style that you see in your head. For instance, he’s reported to have said: “We shall attack and attack until we are exhausted, and then we shall attack again.” Yet he was surrounded by controversy over his leadership methods. Congress and the military actually demanded his removal from command after he slapped a soldier who was suffering from battle fatigue. There were other such incidents, too, but his qualifications are what kept him in the field. He might have stormed through battle zones like Bastogne (do you even know which battle that was, Donnie?), ending them, but he was far from perfect. Donnie, all you do is talk about winning and losing, and yet, nobody has ever conceded defeat to ISIS. Nobody in U.S. leadership has said, “We can’t beat ISIS.” Not our president, not our current commanders. A coach telling his football team “We can’t do this,” hands the game to the other team. Our military doesn’t operate like that, however. It never has. It operates with the understanding that there will be defeats. Learning from those defeats is key to beating ISIS — something you would know if you weren’t such a conceited bastard. On the ground, unit commanders, all the way down to squad leaders, will give pep talks. Yes, that is normal, and you and I both know it. However, those who are guiding the entire war have to be realistic, or they will end up losing it, and they know it. It’s not a football game. ISIS is not WWII, and it’s not a game, Donnie. Your treating it as such doesn’t just show astonishing arrogance, but it also shows that you’re wholly unqualified to be the Commander in Chief of the U.S. military. You will be able to understand how anything works as long as you keep treating everything as winning versus losing. As though it’s a goddamn football game. It’s not. 
Obama thinks he’s fighting a “narrative fight” with ISIS.  When the enemy cuts off your head you have not only lost the narrative, you’ve lost the war. What kind of galactic stupidity does Obama think he’s peddling on Americans?  Islamic Jihadis are slaughtering people by the tens of thousands, they are converting “peaceful Muslims” into Jihadis, and they are winning the war against the world to impose Sharia on all peoples.  Obama says this is a battle between those who are “hijacking” a religion of peace and those who believe Islam is a religion of peace. This is the new normal for peace in our time ala Obama.  America can expect Democrats to not only import cheap labor from Mexico and South America, but import Muslims from the Middle East as refugees from Obama’s New Jihad.  As atonement for killing Sheik Osama bin Laden, Obama has armed, funded, and given American bomber support to the Muslim Brotherhood’s overthrown of Middle Eastern governments.  As he assists the New Caliphate to be reborn, Obama is squandering America’s wealth helping to fund terrorism through Iran, while at the same time inviting our enemies into our homes to make America atone for its sin of resisting Islam. Hillary Clinton has already announced her plans to continue the Obama policies.  She will make foreigners citizens and give them rights not only as Americans, but over Americans as they wish to impose Sharia law on us infidels.  If people are stupid enough to elect a Republican Congress that might deter her, she will have Executive Orders and a Supreme Court to make law as Obama has been allowed to do.  Just who are the mega-fools who believe Hillary would be the more effective counter-terrorist of her and Trump? This is not a conflict of ideologies between which version of Islam is better, let alone which is true.  Fourteen centuries and Muhammad’s own words prove that the Islamic State is fundamentally Islamic.  That it is Obama and his childish belief that Islam is a beautiful religion of peace who is deluded.  Assisting Islam to overcome the world is not going to make the world a better place.  It’s going to make the world into the hellhole that the Muslim Middle East is today.

When Chesapeake School Board Chairwoman Christie New Craig shared a provocative political cartoon to her personal Facebook page last month, Muslims in her state of Virginia immediately used it as an opportunity to complain about racism, discrimination and Islamophobia. “Muslims hate pork, beer, dogs, bikinis, Jesus, and freedom of speech,” the cartoon read. “My question is, what the hell do they come to America for?!” When questioned by reporters at The Virginian-Pilot, Craig maintained that she did not share the cartoon “maliciously.” “I merely shared it,” she told WAVY-TV. “I did not make a comment, and I’m just shocked with everything going on in our country — police officers are losing their lives, people are homeless and people don’t have jobs — that a political cartoon would cause this much stir.” And yet it created so much controversy that the Council on American-Islamic Relations accused Craig of propagating “anti-Muslim bigotry” and demanded that school board members investigate her post. “Only by addressing this issue can the board uphold its stated commitment ‘to the principle of equal opportunity for all and does not permit discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability, military or veteran status, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law,'” the council wrote.  Furthermore, M’hammed Abdous, president of the Muslim Community of Tidewater, questioned the accuracy of the cartoon and asked Craig to apologize for sharing it. Craig did eventually apologize, though she made it abundantly clear that this was the furthest she was willing to go — that she would not resign. Craig clearly never once discriminated against anyone. She simply shared a political cartoon or meme on her private Facebook account. Judging by the way local Muslims responded to her innocuous post, however, it is clear that the cartoon was 100 percent right about one thing: Muslims really do hate freedom of speech. H/T Mad World News Do you find it ironic that the Muslims complaining about this cartoon are inadvertently proving that the cartoon is right?

After Mondayâs debate, Donald Trump almost certainly wishes he had been covered in honey, placed on top of a colony of fire ants, and kicked in his surely gold-plated testicles repeatedly as someone reads âTwilightâ to him rather than face Hillary Clinton in a head-to-head matchup. Moderator Lester Holt reminded Trump that he said Clinton doesnât have a âpresidential lookâ and asked him what he meant by that. âShe doesnât have the look,â Trump replied. âShe doesnât have the stamina. I said she doesnât have the stamina and I donât believe she does have the stamina. ToÂ be President of this country, you need tremendous stamina.â Clinton, who was an absolute badass the entire debate, just stood there. And laughed. And smiled. And let him talk. Then, when it was her turn, she turned the burn up to 9,000 degrees: âWell, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a ceasefire, a release of dissidents, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.â Watch Clinton bring down the hammer below:  
Republican nominee Donald Trump’s Ohio chairwoman recently took it upon herself to prove to the world just how delusional the right-wing in America really is when Kathy Miller told reporters that racism in America didn’t exist until President Obama. “I don’t think there was any racism until Obama got elected. We never had problems like this … Now, with the people with the guns, and shooting up neighborhoods, and not being responsible citizens, that’s a big change, and I think that’s the philosophy that Obama has perpetuated on America. Growing up as a kid, there was no racism, believe me. We were just all kids going to school.” This perfectly illustrates how the right-wing digs their mental bogs of ignorance – blame Obama for literally everything; absolve self/race/identity group of all responsibility, then construct pleasant fantasy. Supporting her candidate’s constant efforts to sabotage what little support he has within the African-American community, she then went on to say that black Americans are responsible for the decades of their socioeconomic disenfranchisement by saying that “if you’re black and you haven’t been successful in the last 50 years, it’s your own fault. You’ve had every opportunity, it was given to you. You’ve had the same schools everybody else went to. You had benefits to go to college that white kids didn’t have. You had all the advantages and didn’t take advantage of it. It’s not our fault, certainly.” To put a big white cherry on this perverse cake of racism, she then felt the need to add that “the Black Lives Matter movement is a stupid waste of time” and that low voter turnout is probably related to how black Americans “were raised.” In one fell swoop, this woman has erased four hundred years of slavery, segregation and the Jim Crow era, the widespread lynchings of black Americans by radical Christian terrorist organizations like the Ku Klux Klan, the ghettoization of the inner cities, mass incarceration and the War On Drugs, and the wholesale slaughter of black Americans by law enforcement from the record. Instead, she is blaming the only black president our nation has ever had, when in reality it was his election that brought all the racism to the surface. She is echoing sentiments shared by a large portion of the American population which has been either brainwashed by media narratives or too ignorant know any better, but it shows just how large a divide we face in try to engage with people so entirely divorced from reality. When the daft old woman was informed that this might sound offensive to some people, she replied “I don’t care, it’s the truth.” The Trump campaign in a nutshell, ladies and gentlemen. UPDATE: Kathy Miller has resigned her from her position with the Trump campaign and has issued an apology. It should be noted the Trump campaign has yet to apologize for anything this campaign season. Watch it here – her remarks begin at 4:40: 
Conservatives are so fed up with hearing about these two Hollywood stars’ marital problems and I’m right there in that group. There is nothing more boring than people who thrive on gossip and what is going wrong in another person’s life. That being said, I’m sure a lot of you are thinking, “Okay, but if she feels that way then why is she writing this story?” The answer to that is quite simple, I agree with Jennifer Aniston’s boyfriend, who was asked about the split up.  No doubt the media was looking for an answer to the effect of, “She’s grinning ear-to-ear and licking her chops.” The problem with that is, Justin Theroux refused to indulge them with a juicy, scandalous answer. It’s no secret that most people expect Aniston to be pleased that the man who cheated on her is splitting from the woman with whom he had the fling. There has to be at least a deep, dark pleasure, right? If there is, Theroux isn’t saying. What he did say is something that I think everyone can agree with, especially men and women who have endured divorce and children of divorce. “As a child of divorce, all I can say is that’s terrible news for those children, and that’s all you can really say,” the 45-year-old star said. “It’s boring to sort of comment on anything else. People are having a bad time. That’s horrible.” You’ll find anyone who is hard-pressed to disagree that divorce isn’t easy on the family unit, even if it is what’s best in the long-run. The first thing I thought when I heard that they were splitting up was, “Oh no, those poor babies.” Anyone who has felt the effects of divorce was probably thinking the same thing. Yes, their relationship was a relatively long one, but that doesn’t mean it was perfect. I just hope they do whatever it takes to make sure those children receive the best of them both and that the babies don’t ever feel like it is their fault that their parents decided to get a divorce. No child should EVER have to feel like they are the reason that their parents didn’t stay married. 
Muslim Somali asylum seeker, Abdullah, in Sundsvall, Sweden is a bastard! Abdullah is well-known by police for his multiple convictions of violent crimes, assaults and molestations. This aggressive piece of garbage has been collecting welfare benefits and committing crimes since he came to Sweden 5 years ago. His most recent crime wasn’t to any stranger this time it was to his wife. He had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard day of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money. Before he left he commanded (not suggested) his wife that her niece she was babysitting MUST be gone before he returned from his night of pleasure. Because he beat her regularly she knew that he meant it. The story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his Muslim right to punish his PREGNANT wife for her disobedience comes into play. He forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach. He then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her. That is strange to me since Muslims aren’t supposedly suppose to have alcohol, I wonder why it was there in the first place. He then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine. Thank you Mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a ‘disobedient’ woman. Especially when pregnant. Quran 4:34 — So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband’s] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand. Just in case there was any doubt as to the proper interpretation of “beat them,” the Islamic prophet Muhammad modeled it literally, telling a visibly battered woman to return to her husband and fulfill his sexual desires and later striking his favorite wife in the chest. I wonder where it says you can pick and choose WHICH edicts from the Quran and hadith you want to obey? This guy is swilling alcohol and abandoning his wife at night but gets to come home and beat her with his hands and fists. I believe the Quran instructs to only beat her with a switch but I guess this nasty louse missed going to mosque too many times OR someone is writing yet another instruction book of terror for Muslims which he is following. 
Anyone watching Monday nightâs highly charged presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump knows that Hillary cleaned Trumpâs clock. Of course, Trumpâs ego will never let him admit that he lost to Hillary, so his surrogates are already being deployed all over the place to spin his embarrassingly terrible debate performance into something positive. The verbal gymnastics there are astounding, but of course these people are Donald Trump surrogates, so they are used to spinning faster than the head of the girl in The Exorcist. One Trump surrogate, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, is taking things a step further, though, and trying to float the idea that Trump should refuse to do future debates with Hillary. Of course, this is just a cowardly move because of Trumpâs abysmal performance. But Giuliani is the Trump Spinner-in-Chief, and instead decided to blame the fact that NBC moderator Lester Holt actually called Trump out on his lies on his suggestion that Trump should skip out next time. Giuliani whined that Holtâs fact-checking was unfair treatment of Trump, and therefore if it were him, he wouldnât debate again without certain petty, childish demands being met: âIf I were Donald Trump, I wouldnât participate in another debate unless I was promised the journalist would act like a journalist, and not an ignorant fact check.Â My advice would be the moderator would have to promise theyâd be a moderator.â When pressed, Giuliani refused to say whether or not he would advise Trump to find a way out of debating Hillary again, only that if it were him, it is what he would do. This is in direct contrast with Trumpâs campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who insists Trump will do both future debates. While both candidates had nothing but good things to say about Holtâs moderation, Giuliani lit into Holt regarding the stop and frisk question, saying that the moderatorâs âinterferenceâregarding the controversial policy and its effects on New York City was âoutrageous.â However, considering that Trump has floated the idea of a nationwide stop and frisk policy, the discussion on that subject and its racist implementation was perfectly reasonable. That didnât stop Giuliani from outright lying in his rant, though, when he said: âIf journalism has ethics, Lester Holt unethically interfering in the area of law he knows nothing about.Â It is not unconstitutional and Trumpâs description of that case was correct.â But, again, this is a lie â a federal judge definitely ruled the policy unconstitutional. At the end of the day, Giulianiâs tantrum is only because he wants his candidate to be able to lie with impunity in front of millions, because most Trump voters are low information plebes, or they simply donât care about Trumpâs bigotry, lies, incompetence, and just general all-around douchebaggery. However, if he gets called out on a debate stage, it makes him look like a fool to undecided voters, who are much more likely to vote for Hillary if they are going to leave third-party camps. If Trump drops out of future debates, he and his surrogates will blame Lester Holt, the so-called âliberalâ media, and anyone and anything besides Trump himself. Rudy Giuliani is just laying the groundwork for that right now.

Progressive liberals are only interested in “protecting children” when they get to define protection, which, apparently doesn’t involve using firearms, but it DOES include dismembering them for the mother’s convenience. Since their definition of protection is kind of wonky, one school has decided to take the safety and well-being of your child into their hands and libs are going bonkers.  To nobody’s surprise, this school is in Texas. Some of the parents are perfectly okay with the sign and knowing the people who are supposed to protect their students can actually do so, if someone comes into the building with intent to harm. “Schools have been a target for, for lack of a better word, crazy people, and I’m perfectly fine with it,” said Jillian Sides, who has two sons, one in 7th grade and one in kindergarten, at the school. The school also plans to place additional signs at all entrances to the school, so everyone entering the school knows that the teachers are packing heat. Let’s set up a scenario for the people who might be against teachers having guns. Let’s say you are dead broke and are at risk of losing your home. You decide, in a moment of desperation, that the only way to gather the money to pay off your debts is to commit robbery. So, you sit down and have a think. Do you rob a bank? Do you rob a convenience store? Do you rob your neighbor up the street? How do you make this decision? Well, banks have pretty serious security. Cameras, sometimes armed guards and buttons that alert the police to any incident taking place. The local 7/11? They installed security cameras the other day after another robbery and you know from talking to one of the clerks that they now have a shotgun under the counter. What about the neighbor who has a “proudly anti-gun” sign in their yard? Chances are that the security at that house is very low. So, any person thinking of committing a crime would be led to believe that hitting the building with the least amount of security would be the safest bet. Sorry, Mr. Jones, that means you. Criminals and crazy people know that schools are hugely gun-free zones, so they can cause the most amount of harm and chaos without fear of physical retaliation. They don’t want to be confronted by a courageous individual with the ability to stop them, so they go to places where the odds of running into one of those is very low. This school has officially made it known that they are dangerous to criminals, which will deter them and cause them to move on to the next target. God bless them for that and thank you for protecting America’s children. 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel finally admitted to the press that if she could go back in time to change her stance on her open migrant policy she would. She is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction. Merkel told the media at a press conference, “If I knew what change in refugee policy the people in Germany want, I would be prepared to consider it.” These comments came shortly after the defeat of the Christian Democratic Union in Berlin’s Sunday elections. She also said, “If I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.” She took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern election. Callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader. The results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many Germans now have. As well as the rise of the anti mass migration Alternative for Germany known as AfD. These factors have forced Merkel to at least consider a change in her stance. Regardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets. In other words it is all talk and no walk. She is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want. However, she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the Christian Social Union. They have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into Germany each year. They specifically want to cap it at 200,000. As well, they want to prioritize Christian migrants over Muslims. But Merkle will not budge on that. Merkel stated, “If people don’t want Muslim asylum-seekers purely because of their religion, that is contrary to our party principles and to Germany’s. The CDU and I cannot go along with that.” Christian Social Union party leader Horst Seehofer threatened to withdraw support for Merkle during her 2017 campaign. Specifically for not implementing the migrant cap. The campaign will be in the federal election. He said, “It is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election.” The growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism, increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime. Which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees. Understandably so. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it. This could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election. Or at least win by an only marginal amount. Serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as President Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s. She is no different which is why many Americans too cannot stand her. 
Now that Donald is our official Republican candidate, and hopefully soon to be President, we can see who he will choose to fill his cabinet with. It may be Hillary’s worst nightmare, and every Republican’s dream come true! Leave it to Trump to hire the best.  During a recent interview, Dr. Carson made a huge announcement about who he believes will be Trumpâs Attorney General: Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX). He is a tough attorney and would be an ideal candidate to prosecute Hillary Clinton for her crimes! Ben Carson on Wednesday floated Ted Cruz as a possible attorney general in a Donald Trump administration, noting that it could allow Cruz to prosecute Hillary Clinton. âI think he would be terrific on the Supreme Court, or I think he would be a terrific attorney general. Or he could be both,â Carson told Fox News Radioâs John Gibson. Carson was asked whether it would be âsmartâ for Trump, now the presumptive GOP nominee, to nominate Cruz to the Supreme Court. âHe could be attorney general first, you know, go ahead and prosecute Hillary, and then go on the Supreme Court,â Carson added. Carson admitted that there are âdeep woundsâ though and it may âtake a little while for that to occur.â Via The Hill Itâs clear that Dr. Carsonâs opinion is respected by Trump, and this endorsement of Cruz will certainly make the appointment more likely to happen. In addition, it would be a terrific way for Trump to work with fellow conservatives who he previously went to battle with. This has Hillary fraught with nerves! Either she wins, or she gets shipped to jail. It seems odd though doesn’t it? She goes to jail or gets a highly respectable job? What is wrong with America?!
Well tell us how you really feel. Normally when a Muslim bashes the USA, you wouldn’t think that they’re an American themselves. Such wasn’t the case when it came to American Olympian fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad,who became the first American to compete in an Olympic games wearing a Hijab. As it turns out, she has some nasty things to say about the country she’s representing. According to her, as quoted by The Federalist Papers: [I feel unsafe] all the time. I had someone follow me home from practice and try to report me to police. And this is right on 28th and 7th in New York City… I want people to know that as hard as [these racist incidents] are on me, they don’t come even close to things we’ve seen like the shooting in North Carolina or the rhetoric around the Khan family at the DNC. It’s ridiculous and we as a country have to change and I feel like this is our moment.” How terrible – but let’s not pretend that we live in an “Islamophobic” country when the number of hate crimes against Jews is a multiple of those against Muslims.  If she thinks America is so terrible, why doesn’t she move to a Muslim country? I think we all know the answer – because no where else in the world do Muslims have it as good as they do in America. She’s not going to be stoned to death in America. She’s not going to have her genitals mutilated in America. She’s not going to be prevented from drinking alcohol in America. She’s not going to have her hand cut off if she were caught stealing in America. When that’s what she faces if she were to live in a Muslim country, I think she can deal with a single incident of racial profiling. 
This weekend, a bombing in New York City rocked the nation as Americans everywhere wondered if we were under attack again. Donald Trump responded to the attack almost immediately, accurately describing it as a “bombing/” CNN, for some inexplicable reason, criticized him for that — even though Hillary Clinton described the attack the exact same way. So CNN edited out Hillary’s wording. And Donald Trump just ripped them a new one for it. In the CNN footage, they only showed Clinton responding to a question from a reporter, where she agreed that Trump was “insensitive” for calling the Chelsea bombing a “bombing.” Jake Tapper played the same footage a second time and again criticized Trump for jumping to conclusions. Both times, the network did not air Clinton’s own description of the attack as a bombing, even though it happened just seconds before she answered the reporter’s question.   Trump was interviewed on Fox and Friends and he held nothing back. “CNN is disgusting and disgraceful,” he declared. “These people are the most dishonest people, CNN is so disgusting and dishonest, and I watch it, it’s so unfair, they call it the Clinton news network. She used the word ‘bombs’ also by the way… I was criticized for calling it correctly – what I said was exactly correct.” He also pointed the finger at “stupid” leaders going soft on terrorism. “Well it’s a mess and it’s a shame and we’re going to have to be very tough,” he said. “I think we’re going to see a big change over the last couple of days, I think this is something that will happen more and more all over the country.” He explained that “because we’ve been weak, out country’s been weak, we’re letting people in by the thousands and the tens of thousands, and as I’ve been saying you’ve got to stop it.”  .@realDonaldTrump slams "dishonest" CNN for editing out Clinton reference to NYC explosion as 'bombing' pic.twitter.com/EG2Yy63B4y — FOX & Friends (@foxandfriends) September 19, 2016   Obama was heavily criticized by Trump for his plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees in 2017 — and Hillary wants to make that number even higher, according to Trump. “Hillary Clinton wants to increase what he’s letting in and he’s letting in thousands of thousands of people… they can’t be properly vetted,” said Trump. “He let in over 100,000 additional people and now Hillary Clinton is raising it by 550 per cent… thousands of people are pouring into our country and we have no idea what we’re doing. Our leaders are – I don’t even say weak – I say stupid.” 
The students in teacher Lee Francis’ history class will probably never forget the lesson he taught on free speech… just not in the way he probably expected. Days ago, a photo appearing to show a teacher (later identified as the aforementioned Lee Francis) Francis, a teacher at Massey Hill Classical High School in Fayetteville, North Carolina, was giving a lesson Monday on the First Amendment. His method? First, he tried to burn the American flag. Then he tried to cut it. Then he placed it on the floor and stepped on it. Many, predictably, were outraged. However, Francis said he wasn’t trying to offend students, just teach them the Supreme Court ruled such acts of free expression were protected. That sounds like a good excuse, but some of his actions make me question whether or not he’s telling the truth. According to Fox News, in a phone interview he stated “Do I regret what I did? Absolutely not. Would I do it again? All I can say is I did it and I stand by it.” He also said that he has obtained legal counsel. “There were some laws broken as far as photos of me taken that violate the county’s policies – and issues that could be considered defamation of character,” he said. Riiiiiight. So he’s all for teaching freedom of speech, but taking a photo is where he draws the line? I don’t know if I’m buying it. Regardless, as WorldStarHipHop reported, he’s now been suspended and there’s an investigation pending. Here’s how this whole ordeal has turned out thus far:  What do you all think? If he really was teaching a lesson on the First Amendment, do you think this is an extreme way of teaching it? While I do find it distasteful, it is a reminder of the freedoms we’re afforded in America. Most people around the world don’t have the same freedom. 
Eric Trump tried to spin a tale on Fox news about how his father started with nothing to build a business empire, only to be smacked down with a reminder that Donald Trump started out as a millionaire. The Republican nominee’s demon spawn appeared on on Friday and attempted to portray his dad as just a normal guy who started with nothing in his journey to live the American dream. After trashing Hillary Clinton as not being relatable to millennial voters, Eric Trump was asked to explain how his father is relatable to them. And his answer was an effort to rewrite the reality of his dad’s life. “He’s built an amazing company. He’s become the epitome of the American dream.” Eric Trump said. “He’s gone from practically nothing to a man who’s just…” But that was a total lie and Julie Roginsky didn’t let the younger Trump get away with it. Roginsky cut Eric Trump off and reminded him that his father got $1 million from his father Fred Trump to start out with. Nothing?” Roginsky said. “He got a million bucks. Come on, Eric.” Indeed, Donald Trump grew up the son of one of the richest men in America. He has never known poverty in his entire life. In 1978, he was given $1 million by his father, an amount that Trump called a “small loan” moments after he claimed that life “hasn’t been easy for me” during a town hall event in October 2015. Of course, that’s an insult to the millions of Americans who live in poverty daily and can’t even get a real small loan to lift themselves out of it. They struggle to put food on the table and to pay the bills, but Donald Trump had everything he could ever want and all the opportunities money could buy. Trump’s dad also started a million dollar trust fund for him and left him a multi-million dollar inheritance when he died. In other words, Donald Trump knows absolutely NOTHING about starting from nothing. But Eric Trump didn’t address Roginsky’s reminder and just continued trying to sell his dad as a man who pulled himself up by his bootstraps. “He epitomized what America’s all about: Opportunity and working hard and being able to achieve your dreams and what you want to succeed, right?” Eric Trump continued. “It’s no different than a Zuckerberg, right, who went out with a great idea like a Facebook and developed this idea and built it and grew it and grew it and grew it. That is achieving something, right? And I think it’s very different than a person who has been a career politician.” Here’s the video via VidMe.  Can no member of Trump’s family actually refrain from lying about their past? Because it’s clear that Donald Trump and his children do not understand what it is like to grow up poor. They have had everything given to them on a golden platter and they’ve never had to work a real job a day in their lives. But for some reason, they think $1 million is the definition of starting with nothing. 
What do Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have in common? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL. The other difference is that Tim Tebow is a man of high class and well respected. The other is an idiot. Tim Tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about Colin Kaepernick’s protest towards the National Anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people. Tebow is known for his religious antics, “Tebowing” celebration, and not being able to make it on another NFL team.   His comments about Kaepernick were as follows… “When people have belief in something,” said Tebow, “or conviction in something, trying to stand for that is a good thing, and it’s all about standing for it the right way.’ Keyword is “STANDING” which Kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers. He’s a high paid bench player and he’s being disrespectful to the fans and Americans. If he wants to protest, that’s cool, but he should do it on his own time. He can do it on Twitter, Facebook, outside of a McDonald’s next to people asking for $15 an hour. He can go on tour and to a Black Lives Matter riot. He can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest. And let’s not forget that NO ONE in this country is oppressed. Claiming you’re oppressed is really you admitting you’re lazy and don’t want to work for anything. How did Obama become President? Was he oppressed? We have a black President. The guy clearly worked to get where he is, so he wasn’t oppressed. Name one person who IS oppressed and I guarantee I can tell you why they are not. I can tell you what they can do to better themselves. I can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life. If anyone is oppressed, its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called Affirmative Action. Tim Tebow was short on words because he’s smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press. He’s too busy working on his career path. Good for Tim and I hope he lands a roster spot on the New York Mets. God knows the Mets need help! Screw Kaepernick. 
It has been 15 years now that we have been fighting the War on Terror. While during George W. Bush’s presidency, we had very few terrorist attacks on American soil. But since Barack Obama has been president, that has changed, especially over the last year. There have been shootings and bombings… and yet Obama is refusing to change anything. After welcoming thousands of Muslim refugees from Syria, we saw an uptick in terrorist attacks… yet, Obama has plans to allow over 110,000 more to enter the United States next year. They have to be Muslim, of course, because racial profiling is the worst thing anyone can do, ever! Well, according to Obama and his fellow liberals, anyway. But that’s exactly what we should be doing, according to KISS front man Gene Simmons. According to him, if we want to win the War on Terror, we need to start profiling everyone… even him! Check out the video below:   “Everyone needs to get smart. I’m okay with profiling,” Simmons declared. “I want you to stop me first. I want you to stop me because I look a certain way. And if I’m clear, than profile someone else. It’s emergency powers during war. There’s a war going on.” But it’s unfair, liberals will certainly cry. Simmons had a response to that, too. “It is unfair,” he said. “That’s why the words ‘too bad’ exist.” It’s kind of sad that the leader of a classic rock band has more common sense than liberal politicians do. Yes, profiling isn’t “nice.” But being nice doesn’t prevent terrorism. Profiling does — just look at Israel, which is surrounded by countries full of terrorists eager to literally wipe them off the map, yet they’re not only still there, they’re one of the strongest countries in the world. Somehow, profiling works well for them.   Muslims are not all terrorists. We know that. But most terrorists in today’s world are, in fact, Muslims. There is nothing wrong with taking a closer look at young Muslim men, for example, to ensure that they don’t have ties to any terrorist organizations like ISIS. If they don’t, then what’s the problem? Liberals complain that profiling violates people’s constitutional rights, yet somehow, they’re perfectly fine with that when it comes to Second Amendment rights. They’re all about gun control, because if it saves even one life, we should do it, even though it infringes upon our constitutional rights. Yet profiling is completely unacceptable? Get real, liberals. You make no sense. 
Monday evening during the presidential debates, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump doubled down on his plan to reinstate “stop-and-frisk,” using New York City as an example of how effective it was in in eradicating crime. Responding to Lester Holt assertion that “stop and frisk” was ruled unconstitutional, Donald Trump said, “No, you’re wrong. It went before a judge who was a very against police judge. It was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal.” Fact Check: Stop and Frisk is unconstitutional and was neither lawful nor effective. The program, in which police officers arbitrarily decide when to stop and question a pedestrian, then frisk them for weapons and other contraband, was found to be unlawful after evidence provided proved the NYPD engaged in patterns of unconstitutional stops that were more likely to affect African-American and Latino citizens. The program’s defenders claimed high crime rates were the reason behind the disproportionate targeting of minorities, but Jeffrey Fagan at Columbia Law School found after an investigation into the program, that “even if you control for the crime rate, the racial makeup of a precinct is a good predictor of the number of stops” police do in a particular area. “Anyone who says we know this is bringing the crime rate down is really making it up,” Fagan says. Others wouldn’t put it that harshly, but the evidence does seem to suggest that stop and frisk is, at best, ineffective, and, at worst, purposefully targets communities illegally.    Examining the number of police stops per seizures of illicit goods mapped out by race, it becomes blatantly obvious that not only are African-Americans stopped over 5x more than whites, the disproportionate targeting is ineffective in reducing crime further because it ignores that the numbers suggest there would be more illicit good seizures if police attention was concentrated more appropriately in groups with a lower stop-per-seizure. Moreover, as foreign correspondent for NBC News Katy Tur live-tweeted during the debate, the murder rate in New York City did not drop until after stop-and-frisk was declared unconstitutional and stopped, it also has not risen beyond a level of concern.   
One of former President Bill Clinton’s oldest friends has come forward and said what she believed was wrong with Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and if she’s right, it could be detrimental to the former secretary of state. Dolly Kyle, author of “Hillary the Other Woman,” said Clinton has been “’cruisin’ for a bruisin’,” because she’s so angry and driven by rage. “People like that eventually break down, physically.” “Hillary Clinton is not physically fit to be president,” Kyle told WND. “Anyone who believes that she is has their eyes closed. If she was in a wheelchair or blind or something like that, she could still do the job. But she is losing her mental capabilities, she’s suffering from real cognitive impairment.” Kyle, an award-winning lawyer, also said Clinton is showing evidence of emotional instability, memory loss and difficulty carrying out tasks. These symptoms coupled with Clinton’s paranoia and desire to control could only result in a psychological disaster. “That paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,” Kyle said, and it’s simply not a good combination for anyone — much less the president of the United States. Kyle said she wrote her book because she wanted everyone to know the truth about Hillary Clinton — and Clinton’s health was just one troubling aspect of a larger picture. Clinton is addicted to power, and will stop at nothing to get what she wants — even if it means jeopardizing her health and the Democrat party, according to Kyle. “She has been running for president ever since she took hold of Billy Clinton’s coattails so many decades ago in 1971,” the lawyer said. This was more bad news for Clinton, who has struggled to keep a positive image while deflecting scandals not only about her health but about her character and her ability to lead this country. Share this story and let us know what you think about Dolly Kyle’s claim that Hillary Clinton is losing her mental capacities. What do you think about Clinton's fitness for office?

Jimmy Kimmel had an opportunity to bash Donald Trump in front of an audience of millions at the Emmys and he did not disappoint. He even went after Trump’s enablers who were sitting in the audience. Kimmel opened the ceremony by poking fun of Hollywood’s elite and making several sarcastic but pointed jokes about diversity. “This year’s nominees are the most diverse ever. And here in Hollywood, the only thing we value more than diversity is congratulating ourselves on how much we value diversity. The Emmys are so diverse this year, the Oscars are telling people we’re one of their closest friends.” Kimmel sarcastically riffed about the existence of television making it possible for such self-aggrandizing and bombastic egotists like Trump to thrive. “If it weren’t for television, would Donald Trump be running for president? No. He would be at home right now quietly rubbing up against his wife Malaria, while she pretends to be asleep.” And when it came to who was responsible for creating the five-alarm dumpster fire that is Donald Trump’s presidency, Kimmel singled out Mark Burnett, the brainchild behind Celebrity Apprentice. “That’s right. That guy. Mark Burnett, the man who brought us ‘Celebrity Apprentice. Thanks to Mark Burnett, we don’t have to watch reality shows anymore, because we’re living in one. Thank you, Mark.” Perhaps only the guy who invented the infomercial is responsible for more suffering than Mark Burnett. That’s why Kimmel nominated Burnett to be the first one tossed over Trump’s wall, should Trump convince enough deplorables to vote against their economic self-interests.

Even if you are President Obama, your jokes need to have good timing. Unfortunately for our President, his ISIS joke came at the same time as the terrorists bombings in New Jersey and New York. Even comedians have bad day. Chalk this one up as a bad day for our Comedian-in-Chief  As Written By Blake Neff for the Daily Caller: Obama Jokes About ISIS Same Day America Gets Bombed. President Barack Obama made a joke with unfortunately bad timing Saturday, quipping that the Islamic State was no big deal compared to his birth certificate, only to have America hit by two separate explosions. While addressing a dinner held by the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Saturday night, Obama joked about Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s recent declaration that Obama was, in fact, born in America. “I don’t know about you guys, but I am so relieved that the whole birther thing is over,” Obama said. “I mean, ISIL, North Korea, poverty, climate change, none of those things weighed on my mind like the validity of my birth certificate.” Unfortunately, at almost the same time Obama made his remarks, the … Full Story Here: Obama Jokes About ISIS Same Day America Gets Bombed Twice | The Daily Caller
A cafeteria worker in a Pennsylvania school district just quit her job, saying the district’s new lunch policy is morally bankrupt. Stacy Koltiska turned in her resignation letter after being forced to throw away a child’s hot meal in front of a full cafeteria because his parents owed more than $25 to the Canon-McMillan school district, south of Pittsburgh. According to the Washington Post, the school board recently adopted the controversial new policy this fall to recoup thousands of dollars in debt owed to the district. “His eyes welled up with tears. I’ll never forget his name, the look on his face,” Koltiska wrote on her Facebook page after turning in her resignation. Koltiska, who worked the cash register at Wylandville Elementary School in Eighty Four, Pennsylvania, said the total cost of the hot meal was just $2.05, and that the policy required her to throw out the child’s hot meal and replace it with a sandwich made of two slices of white bread and a cold slice of government cheese. However, the student’s lunch account is still charged the standard $2.05 for the meal even if they had their hot lunch taken away. High school students don’t get a meal at all, under the new policy. “God is love, and we should love one another and be kind,” Koltiska told the . “There’s enough wealth in this world that no child should go hungry, especially in school. To me this is just wrong.” Koltiska blasted the policy as immoral, and the board members who passed it as indifferent to the plight of hungry children. “They’re suits at a board meeting,” she said. “They are not the ones facing a child and looking them in the eye and taking their food away.” Matthew Daniels, the superintendent of the Canon-McMillan district, told WTAE-TV the policy isn’t intended to shame hungry children, but to recoup lost revenue. Before the policy was implemented, Daniels said more than 300 families owed approximately $60,000 to $100,000 on their lunch accounts, collectively. Now, fewer than 70 families owe roughly $20,000. Daniels added that students on free or reduced lunch programs aren’t subject to the new policy. “There has never been the intent with the adoption of this policy to shame or embarrass a child,” he said. In a viral Facebook post, Koltiska implored readers to email Superintendent Daniels and Joni Mansmann, the district’s director of business and finance, and to ask them to repeal the policy. Their emails are @[email protected]  and [email protected] , respectively. ATTENTION ALL PARENTS WHO HAVE CHILDREN IN THE CANON McMILLAN SCHOOL DISTRICT!!! I need to inform you about a new… Posted by Stacy Myers Yannazzo Koltiska on Thursday, September 15, 2016        
An independent examiner has determined that Tyre King, the 13 year-old African-American boy fatally shot by Columbus, OH police last Wednesday, was “more likely than not” running away from an officer at the time he was shot. The conclusion would seem to contradict the official police narrative, which holds that King was shot in a confrontation with officers after “he pulled a realistic-looking BB gun on them”. King was shot at 7:42 pm last Wednesday after officers responded to reports of an armed robbery over $10 by a group of three African-American teenagers. According to the official police department report, “officers followed the males to an alley and attempted to take them into custody when one suspect pulled a gun from his waistband. One officer shot and struck the suspect multiple times.” The Columbus coroner’s office has completed an autopsy of King’s body but the results won’t be made public for at least six weeks. It was this delay that prompted King’s family to hire an independent medical examiner, Dr. Francisco Diaz, who is a professor of pathology at the University of Michigan and works as a medical examiner for Wayne County, MI. In a statement released by the King family’s attorney today, Diaz said that “based on the location and the direction of the wound paths it is more likely than not that Tyre King was in the process of running away from the shooter or shooters when he suffered all three gunshot wounds.” It is not in question that King was involved in the robbery; indeed his friend Demetrius Braxton, 19, who was with King that night and has since been arrested, said that King “wanted to rob somebody for money.” Diaz’s report, however, confirms the suspicions of many in the community and across the country that the use of lethal force by responding officers was unnecessary and that a story of King aiming his gun at the police had been concocted as a justification. Indeed Braxton’s account of the encounter, given before the results of Diaz’s investigation were reported, similarly contradicts the official narrative. He told the local newspaper that “the cops said ‘get down’ and We got down, but my friend [King] got up and ran … [and] when he ran, the cop shot him.” The last time we checked, petty thievery does not carry the death sentence in the United States of America. While many will be inclined to somehow argue that the boy deserves it for committing a robbery, consider this. When young white men are convicted of rape in America, like Brock Turner, judges let them walk because they think they deserve a second chance. When young African-Americans commit crimes, they are smeared as career criminals and executed on the spot. The King case is only the most recent in a long string of deadly encounters between young African-American men and the police, many of which have been muddled by the victims’ having been carrying BB guns made to look like authentic firearms. Given the ubiquity not only of BB guns but of actual firearms as well amongst white Americans the implication – and sometimes overt justification – by police that the mere presence of what looks like a weapon on a young African-American boy constitutes a deadly threat is questionable at best. The injustice of such encounters becomes even clearer when the victim has his back to the police, a situation in which lethal force should never be the answer. And what is most insidious about these cases is the apparently reflexive instinct of the police to lie, as they seem to have done in King’s case by claiming that he was pointing his weapon at officers when he was shot. Far more than the peaceful protests of Black Lives Matter, it is these fabricated standoffs between police and black youth that fuel the fiction of the “war on police.” Through their attorney, King’s family have asked that the public “continue to withhold final judgement until all the facts are known and vetted.” They have also called for an independent investigation into their son’s killing, saying that “The Columbus police department, the City of Columbus and most importantly Tyre King and his family deserve the benefit of an investigation from a law enforcement agency that has no direct impact from the outcome of that investigation.”
What exactly is the point of the FBI? I know what they say they’re supposed to do, but what is their actual purpose? I mean, if you tell them and you know that someone in your family is engaged in terrorist activity and it coincides with the rise of ISIS and they do nothing, what are we paying them to do exactly? I hope they feel terrible about themselves and what’s more, I hope they are ordered to pay the medical bills of the victims, as well as the pain and suffering and lost wages. What is the point of the government telling us “see something, say something” if when we see something and say something, nothing comes of it until the attempted murder of American citizens?  Ahmad Khan Rahami, the man who is being accused of creating and/or detonating hidden IEDs in New York/New Jersey, was captured by police. Afterward, it was revealed that his own father had reported him to the Federal Bureau of Investigations in 2014 for “being a terrorist” according to The New York Times. Two years before Ahmad Khan Rahami went on a bombing rampage in New York and New Jersey, his father told the police that the son was a terrorist, prompting a review by federal agents, according to two senior law enforcement officials. The father made the statement about his son being a terrorist to New Jersey police in 2014, when Mr. Rahami was arrested after a domestic dispute and accused of stabbing his brother. The information was passed to the Joint Terrorism Task Force led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Newark. Officers opened what is known as an assessment, the most basic of F.B.I. investigations, and interviewed the father, who then recanted. It is thought that the father only made the comment out of anger at his son, but it was very clear that he knew something he didn’t actually want the FBI to investigate. Is the father also accountable for his son’s actions for recanting a statement that was clearly true and putting decent, hardworking Americans at risk? Or is this just on his son, who was the actual creator and distributor of the explosive devices? In my opinion, there’s enough blame to go around. Obviously, the actual terrorist himself receives the bulk of it, but I also would like to point my finger at the father who (it would seem) hid what he knew about his son’s activities and the FBI who didn’t continue the investigation. 
Here is another great example of WHY you need to be professional on your personal facebook profile. Because people get nosy and then they get whiny! The news report says the “Muslim organizations” are very concerned about a Facebook post shared by School Board Chairwoman Christie New Craig. It’s a cartoon and it raise a very valid question: “Muslims hate pork, beer, dogs, bikinis, Jesus, and freedom of speech. My question is, what the hell do they come to America for?!” I guess I am curious about that myself, often. M’hammed Abdous, president of the Muslim Community of Tidewater, who has NO children within the school district had heard about the comic from a Chesapeake resident and said, “I found it saddening and disappointing that kind of language came from someone involved in educating children,” It’s JUST a cartoon. Craig gave a clever response to the complaint pointing out that she had not commented on the post or endorse it in any way. “I did not post that maliciously,” she said last week while claiming to not hate any racial groups or religions. “I’m not racist. I wasn’t raised that way.I share a lot of stuff, a lot of jokes and whether I support it or not, I share stuff,” she added in a phone interview with WAVY News. “[It] doesn’t mean I agree with it. It does mean I have a right to expression and free speech.” Abdous demanded an apology which he’ll likely get since it wasn’t that big of deal to Mrs. Craig. The irony of it all is part of the cartoon said that Muslims hate freedom of speech. ROFLMAO yeah it’s really funny that this guy is upset that Mrs. Craig gets to post whatever she wants on her FB page.  
Alicia Garza, co-founder of BlackLivesMatter, has demanded that there should black communities without any cops. This ignorant statement of hers is turning heads throughout the whole country, but not for the reasons she wants.  In the wake of the latest spate of black men forcing cops to shoot them, one of the founders of the Black Lives Matter movement says it’s time for the police to leave the black community. The idea apparently is that black neighborhoods, full of the worst criminals this country has to offer, would be safer without the protection of the police department. Alicia Garza co-founded Black Lives Matter on the lie of Trayvon Martin’s death and it came to national prominence on the lie of Michael Brown’s death. With a foundation built entirely out of bullshit, it’s no surprise that everything that comes out of the mouth of one of their founding mothers is completely asinine. Garza did an interview with Complexand it was one for the ages. In regards to the recent police shootings of black men in Tulsa, OK and Charlotte, NC, Garza hasn’t seen the videos, which support the police officers, but somehow she knows the cops were wrong. “I’ve chosen not to[watch the videos]. I think we know what it looks like when somebody is murdered, said Garza. Yeah, screw the facts. She doesn’t want them getting in the way of her preconceived notions and general hatred of law enforcement. Then there is this about the Charlotte riots, which erupted after a black cop shot and killed an armed black man: “The thing that people get so concerned about is how do we stop the violence in Charlotte, but yet we’re not thinking about the fact that there’s been violence in Charlotte since way before whatever is happening there has happened. The brother who was killed is a form of state violence. He was killed and the police will not release the video. The police are not taking accountability for the violence that they enact in our communities and yet there isn’t as much outrage about that as there is about some broken windows and lost property,” she said. A black protester shot and killed another random protester. Mobs of blacks have beaten the shit out of innocent white people because of the color of their skin. This is more than broken windows and lost property and it’s based on yet another lie. “How do we stop violence, looting, and riots? The way that we stop that is by making sure that people have the things that they need to thrive. When people are systematically denied their right to adequate housing, adequate schools, to adequate food, to dignity—this is a response and a reaction that we should absolutely expect,” Garza said. What a lot of people do to get adequate housing, schools, food, and dignity is work, you know, like at a job where they earn money to buy necessities. It works a lot better than looting for those things or hoping the government will give them to you. And finally Garza says the black community would be better off without any police at all: “Ultimately, policing in and of itself is problematic. I know that in this country we give a lot of veneration to police. In the ethos of this country, police can do no wrong. And if and when police do wrong, it’s a case of individual bad apples, as opposed to a corroded and corrupt system… Quite frankly, many of our [Black Lives Matter] members are continuing to investigate what it would mean to have police-free communities. I think what we’ve continued to see over time is that no moral appeal is actually stopping the deaths of black people, whether they be armed or unarmed,” said Garza. Interesting theory. She’s saying that cops kill blacks so getting them out of black neighborhoods will mean no blacks will ever be killed. This ignores the fact that almost all black people are killed by other blacks and that by removing cops from the equation there will be even more black killers running loose in the black community. But hey, good luck with that. Do these people realize what a cop free community would look like? It’s not all happy and bliss as they think it would be. It would make matters SO much worse. I can’t stress this enough; WE NEED POLICE. enchanted Sep 26, 2016 at 4:34 pm I will bet ten dollars she wouldn’t live in a cop free zone.
Bloomberg News will become the first ever 24 hour cable news television network to live broadcast a presidential debate with live, in-screen fact checking tonight. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton released a 19 page fact-check in advance of tonight’s debate listing the many lies and false bromides spread by her opponent. Considering that Republican nominee Donald Trump  averages one lie per 3.5 minutes of public statements, their graphics and fact check teams will be working overtime, according to Politico: Bloomberg TV will conduct on-screen fact checks of statements made by both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton during Monday night’s debate, POLITICO has confirmed. The channel’s decision to conduct an on-screen fact-check sets Bloomberg apart from the other major TV networks, none of whom have committed to doing on-screen fact checks during the debate. Most will leave the fact-checking to segments in the post-debate analysis coverage. NPR is also planning an aggressive fact checking strategy in their online news offerings, and all of the networks plan to check facts after the candidates leave the stage, but in this extraordinary election there’s no better time than when 100 million Americans and people around the world watching live. Bloomberg News is setting an exemplary standard which  NBC News has refused to emulate. NBC host Lester Holt, a registered Republican, will moderate tonight’s event. Hopefully, all of the major broadcast news networks will make the effort to upgrade their fact checking teams in time for the last two debates, one of which moderated by Fox News’ Chris Wallace has already been announced as a fact-free debate. Facts don’t matter much to Republican voters or Trump supporters, but to the moderates and independents who don’t know what policies are at stake in this year’s election, they’re very important, and should be what they base their voting decisions upon. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will only share a stage tonight and for two other nights – if all goes as planned with the next two debates – so there’s limited time to disseminate what’s factual versus what isn’t to American voters immediately while attention is on the truth. Unless we want this election to truly usher in a “post-truth” era where information is accepted regardless of its relation to reality, we must hold Donald Trump to the truth. We cannot allow him to lie to the American people any longer. Tonight’s debate begins at 9pm. You can click here to watch online. 
Copious amounts of alcohol will likely be consumed as anticipation over tonight’s presidential debate reaches a boiling point. Some Twitter users have found a creative way to express both their excitement and their frustration at watching Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump take the debate stage at Hofstra University tonight. While some have suggested playing drinking games in which the viewer takes a sip of an alcoholic beverage whenever Hillary Clinton refers to becoming the first woman president or when Trump mentions building a wall, some have taken the concept of a drinking game for the first televised conversation between the two candidates to a new level: DEBATE DRINKING GAME RULES: When the debate starts, do a bunch of PCP — Ian Boudreau (@iboudreau) September 26, 2016  The loser of tonight's debate will be my liver — Erin Gloria Ryan (@morninggloria) September 26, 2016  Others have lamented on how the media will likely “grade Trump on a curve,” meaning he will be held to a much lower standard than Hillary Clinton. Others remarked on the GOP nominee’s “unconventional” preparation, and how Hillary Clinton is likely preparing herself for Trump’s barbs. TRUMP: I did a doodie in my diapie. Sad!

It was only a matter of time before the military would start reeducating servicemen (or is it “servicepeople?”) about how to behave around others who are born with one set of sex organs but “identify” as a member of the opposite sex. All troops will be required to be trained in how to behave around transgender people by July of 2017, coinciding with the date that the Navy will begin accepting transgender recruits. Military.com reported: In an all-Navy message published Tuesday, Chief of Naval Personnel Vice Adm. Robert Burke said a three-pronged training approach will equip senior leaders and rank-and-file personnel for the changes. “This training will emphasize policies and expectations of personal behavior,” the message states. Beginning Nov. 1, mobile training teams composed of Navy fleet representatives and subject matter expects will be dispatched to deliver face-to-face briefs to senior leaders, including commanding officers, executive officers, command master chiefs, and chiefs of boat. These sessions will also be open to equal opportunity advisers, ombudsmen and other command-designated representatives who will have a role in training the tenant commands on policies governing transgender troops. Along with permitting transgender troops to serve openly, the military is creating procedures for troops to change their “gender marker” in the administrative Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, and laying out rules to govern how troops might undergo medical gender transitions while in uniform. Transgender troops will be required to use the bathroom and berthing facilities associated with their preferred gender, Navy officials have said. And service leaders will be on alert for those who seek to single out or mistreat their transgender counterparts. The Military Times reported that transgender troops are now eligible to receive sex-reassignment surgery paid for by the Pentagon (taxpayers) as long as they’re active-duty, and there is approval from their doctors and military health officials. The surgical procedure to rearrange the active duty military member’s genitals to vaguely resemble those of the opposite sex can be performed at a military hospital, or if it’s not available at the time – or if there’s a long wait time – Tricare will cover it at a private hospital.

Charlotte thug rioters gang jumped a man in a parking garage for a really good reason – the guy was white! WHY ELSE WOULD A BUNCH OF BLACK PEOPLE BEAT UP A RANDOM WHITE GUY? The fact that the white guy was in a parking garage meant either he lived there or was visiting someone. Or, he works there. That being said, he probably has a job. Work is something the Black Lives Matter thugs don’t like to participate in. They’d rather sit around being bums all day, then beating people at night every time a cop shoots a criminal. The white guy in this video has nothing to do with the shooting of that Keith Lamont Scott fella or any other black person shot by a cop. It doesn’t even matter if a BLACK COP SHOOTS A BLACK THUG – the losers still use it as an excuse to steal, beat people, and destroy a neighborhood. This is sadly what people are now calling the “black mentality” or the “thug mentality” and it’s extremely sad because that is NOT how things should be. Hannity – Although numerous individual acts of assault, looting, and violence have been reported, one horrible incident seems to capture the chaos that enveloped Charlotte on Wednesday evening. In a video making the rounds on social media, an unidentified man is beaten and dragged along the ground as he begs his assailants for mercy. The beating is said to have taken place in the garage of the Epicenter, a shopping mall in downtown Charlotte This is NOT what being an American is all about. This is NOT what being black or white is about either. There’s so many better black American’s who deserve recognition for the good things they do, but every time riots like this happen, those good people get blurred out by the bad black Americans. I think it’s time for the good people of the African American community to shape up or ship out the loser thugs. #CharlotteProtest Beating man begging for mercy in parking garage. @AC360 @seanhannity @BretBaier Credit:Lenard Bennett (facebook) @ncnaacp pic.twitter.com/YWHEU2UV1n — Libertarian Queen (@LibertarianQn) September 22, 2016  Start reprimanding the thugs on their senseless behavior. People like the thugs in this video make the rest of a culture look bad. Stand up to them and don’t let them hold your culture and skin color hostage. There are too many good black people in this world to let some thuggish losers make the rest of them look bad. When the good black people of America stand up and reprimand the bad ones, then you’ll see a real change. Good people thrive while thugs like this will always be losers. Don’t let the losers hold you down. 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump claims to have “a great relationship with the blacks“while nearly every poll shows Trump losing the constituency by 80 percent or more. One of Trump’s vile advisers went so far as to say Trump doesn’t speak in front of predominately black crowds because he fears for his life, and with Trump’s recent disgusting comments in North Carolina about black voters, it is no surprise as to why. The failed businessman gave a rambling, fact lacking, nonsensical speech in Kenansville, North Carolina where he lamented about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s lack of foreign policy experience, despite Clinton being the most qualified presidential candidate in American history. After Trump’s failed attack, he moved on show the nation why black voters do not support his candidacy : Our African American communities are in the worse shape they’ve ever been… Ever. Ever. Ever. This single tweet explains Trump’s racism perfectly:    It is quite convenient for Trump to neglect eras of history in the United States where black individuals were in, as he put it, “worse shape.” Apparently, Trump forgot the ancient times of less than 60 years ago, where black people were dehumanized, beaten, and shot with fire hoses while they attempted to fight for equal and fair treatment under the law. If Trump were to look at his history book, which isn’t going to happen because the only books he owns are about how Hitler was a swell guy, he’d find it wasn’t until 1967 that the Supreme Court struck down anti-interracial marriage laws in seventeen states making it legal for black and white people to marry anywhere in the United States. Perhaps the fake billionaire meant that black people were better off in America as slaves? That would be one of Trump’s best business concepts towards profits. Trump would reason black individuals would be fools not to prefer slavery, as they would be losing out on confirmed lifelong job security. The pandering by Trump to the vilest racists among his ignorant constituency is no longer a dog whistle, but a blatant declaration that America as a nation is divided by race. He is implicitly longing to return to an era of segregated bathrooms, restaurants, and water fountains. Trump highly preferred America when good honest white folks were given all of the best seats on public transportation, and black people, of who Trump said “laziness is a trait in black people” is doing them a favor by forcing them to walk to the back of the bus. Trump’ deplorable ‘s character is on display for all to see, and his ignorant comments have done him no favors in helping to win over a key constituency he needs to win if he hopes to capture the White House. Despite North Carolina being the state with the 7th largest black population, there is willy-nilly a black face in the entire crowd. Watch all of Trump’s heinous speech below, if you must. 
In an interview with a Toledo, Ohio news station, Donald Trump accidentally admitted that his âbigâ 20-second announcement that Barack Obama was born in the United States, âperiod,â was just a ruse. Speaking toÂ ABC6/FOX28, Trump seems to have again picked up the birther ball in a âwink and nodâ fashion. âThis announcement earlier this week with you saying that you believe President Obama was in fact born in the United States, after all the years where youâve expressed some doubt, what changed?â interviewer Ben Garbarek asked, prompting Trump to explain that he caved because he didnât want to talk about it anymore â no other reason: âWell I just wanted to get on with, I wanted to get on with the campaign. A lot of people were asking me questions. We want to talk about jobs. We want to talk about the military. We want to talk about ISIS and get rid of ISIS. We want to talk about bringing jobs back to this area because youâve been decimated so we just wanted to get back on the subject of jobs, military, taking care of our vets, etc.â Yes, being able to âget onâ with his campaign without being bothered by inconvenient questions about the five years he spent attempting to delegitimize the President by demanding his birth certificate, college transcripts and applications, and other documents he wasÂ  would prove that Barry Soetoro (as the President is known in birther circles) is a Kenyan-born conman who managed to install himself as President through what we can only assume isâ¦magic. Sadly, this accidental admission that his views on the Presidentâs birthplace and eligibility for office had not changed one iota is perhaps the most honest thing Trump has said lately, with much of his attention being focused on defending the Trump Foundationâs misuse of charitable funds to pay The Donaldâs personal legal fees, attacking African-American communities, and practically publicly masturbating over the recent attacks in New York and New Jersey. Watch the interview below:  
Back in August, after showing up an hour late to her first campaign event in Nevada, Hillary was used by Ed Hendy “The FBI believes you tried to wipe the entire server. Did you try to wipe the entire…so there could be no email–no personal, no official; wipe the whole thing?” Hillary acted puzzled in her reply, interpreting the question literally; “Like with a cloth or something?” I say she was acting because she had previously wiped her server with BleachBit, a tool so good for deleting emails permanently that “even God can’t read them,” as Trey Gowdy put it in a committee meeting. He cited it as “further proof that Clinton had something to hide in deleting personal emails from the private email system she used during her tenure as Secretary of State.” I’m inclined to think the same, given Hillary’s lengthy history of dishonesty. Now, we’ve just uncovered PROOF that Hillary has researched how to delete emails permanently without leaving a trace. Paul Combetta, an IT specialist who helped Hillary Clinton wipe her server clean of evidence requested from federal authorities, took to online forums to find advice on how to commit the crime. Combetta cited his Fifth Amendment rights in refusing to answer questions before a congressional committee last week, but was pretty talkative when trying to find out information from fellow IT experts on how to forge Clinton’s e-mails. As the Gateway Pundit reported: BREAKING: Citizen Journalist breaks HUGE Clinton email story PROVING Hillary ORDERED EMAILS TO BE STRIPPED! #MAGA https://t.co/m5fYUmibpT — Rep. Steven Smith (@RepStevenSmith) September 19, 2016  This exchange took place on Reddit and involves Paul Combetta, an employee with Platte River Networks, the company in charge of Hillary Clinton’s home server. SMOKING GUN: “BleachBit” Paul Combetta ASKED TO STRIP OR REPLACE VIP’s EMAIL ADDRESS! https://t.co/nz13MqzWth #MAGA pic.twitter.com/qQII96JI76 — Katica (@GOPPollAnalyst) September 19, 2016  Combetta was granted immunity from Obama’s Department of Justice in their investigation of Clinton. Combetta was the employee who deleted all of Hillary Clinton’s emails. According users on Reddit, Combetta asked for assistance in July 2014 from Reddit users on how to purge emails and how to strip VIP’s email address from “a bunch of archived emails.” Read the entire exchange here.  After the Gateway Pundit broke this story, a number of comments from the Reddit thread in question suspiciously went missing, but Archive.is has a link of the deleted reddit post. And just a random thought: how stupid do you have to be to get advice on committing a Federal crime on Reddit? 
The first presidential debate between Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is scheduled to take place Monday, September 26. Moderated by NBC’s Lester Holt, the debate will take place at Long Island’s Hofstra University. The format will be a 90-minute program without commercial breaks. Personally, I have to admit that I can’t wait to see the real estate magnate and the former secretary of state engage in a verbal boxing match. Apparently, I am not alone. The first Trump-Clinton face off is anticipated by experts to draw “as many as 100 million viewers – reaching almost as many people as the Super Bowl.” Barack Obama’s first debate with Mitt Romney in 2012, garnered over 70 million viewers, which was the highest number for a debate since 1980 when 80.6 million viewers tuned in to watch President Jimmy Carter debate Republican presidential candidate, Ronald Reagan. The reasons for the unprecedented interest are apparent. The 2016 presidential race has been patently different from any presidential campaign in recent history. First of all, the race is incredibly close. Clinton only has an aggregate lead of 3 points over Trump in the national race. However, Trump currently has the lead in several battleground states including  Florida, North Carolina and Ohio.  On the most basic level, the two candidates who have been called everything from the “most polarizing” to the “least-liked” candidates in history are also the most interesting. In the Democratic corner, you have Hillary Clinton, the woman who has spent most of her adult life in politics and arguably has been aspiring to the presidency for over 20 years. You only have to read her college thesis to see that the seeds of her ambition were already germinating on the Wellesley campus. Obviously, Clinton also brings to the arena not only her past history as a former  first lady, former senator and former secretary of state, she also brings a suite of scandals involving her use of an unsecured email server during her tenure at the State Department, quid for quo dealings involving the Clinton Foundation etc. In the Republican corner, you have Donald Trump, a real estate billionaire whose last name has graced everything from hotels to ties. Trump also deepened his fame by becoming a reality show creator and star with his now legendary show “The Apprentice.” One could argue that being a reality star was the perfect training ground for diving into the fishbowl called politics. The debate‘s anticipated high ratings are also predicated on the assumption that everyone wants to witness the dynamics between Clinton and Trump in a one on one conversation format. We have heard a lot about their different styles of debate preparation. Supposedly, Trump has been studying videos of  Clinton to better understand her body language and facial gestures. Clinton has been  reportedly using her long time aide Philippe Reines as the “Trump” stand-in during mock debate sessions. It will be interesting to see what happens when these two individuals who have been spending the last few months attacking each other indirectly via media interviews, campaign rallies and tweets actually get into the same room. When was the last time that happened? January 22, 2005, the day of Donald Trump’s marriage to Melania Knauss? Yes, that’s right Bill and Hill were guests at the Donald’s third nuptial ceremony. Over the last few weeks, there has been a lot of speculation about Mrs. Clinton’s health and whether she is physically capable of serving as president. Her recent fainting episode at the 15th anniversary of the September 11thattacks (which has been since explained as a reaction to pneumonia) has been feeding the “bad health” rumors which have been circulating since her 2012 concussion. Most recently, the speculation has deepened with theories covering everything from Parkinsons to a neurological problem. It has not helped the situation that Mrs. Clinton has also had public instances where she appeared physically unstable or in need of assistance mounting stairs. And of course, most recently a video has circulated of Mrs. Clinton addressing a largely union audience where she asked the rhetorical question of why she isn’t 50 points ahead of Donald Trump in the race. More than one pundit has described her demeanor in this video as “unhinged.” As for Mr. Trump, critics point to situations where he spoke bluntly such as saying that we need to bar all Muslims from entering the United States until we have a mechanism for vetting them. He also famously received a lot of criticism for his early remarks that some of the Mexicans entering the United States illegally are “rapists and drug dealers.”  Many viewers may tune in to see if Trump will put his foot in his mouth. Many will approach the debate with this perspective despite the fact that for the last two months Trump has been vigorously campaigning, delivering one policy speech after another while staying very much on message. Of course, the whole point of a presidential debate is for the candidates to have an opportunity to showcase their platforms to the American people. Obviously, their ability to effectively answer the moderator’s questions within the confines of a designated time frame and other guidelines are part and parcel of the debate. While viewers may be intrigued by the spectacle, they are also interested in hearing more about the issues. While we have heard a lot about Trump’s policies, we have not heard as much about Clinton’s.  Although, this week we did hear that she plans to impose a 65% estate tax on the wealthiest individuals. I am sure people may want to hear more about that. Also, media bias has played a huge role in the campaign. Many people may be tuning to see if Lester Holt will be a fair moderator. Of course, the primary reason people are tuning in to the debate is that the winner of the debate may very well become the winner of the election for  the US presidency. After all, the race is all about who has the best vision, the best plan and the likelihood of ultimately delivering the best results for the American people.

Donald Trump is calling for one of the most controversial and racially charged policies enacted by police departments to be expanded across the entire country. The city of New York recently ended âstop and frisk,â but Trump is pushing for it, apparently egged on by his top campaign surrogate, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani. From : In a pre-taped interview on Fox News scheduled to air Wednesday night, Trump was asked by an audience member what he would do to address âviolence in the black communityâ and âblack-on-black crime.â Trump responded by proposing that âstop-and-friskâ policing, in which an officer is empowered to stop an individual and frisk them for weapons or any other illegal contraband, be adopted nationwide. âI would do stop-and-frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically,â Trump told the questioner. Stop-and-frisk was repeatedly called out and protested against by New York City residents because the policy was shown time and time again to disproportionately target black and Latino residents. They were singled out for examination and interrogation by police officers, in what some felt were quotas set up by police management. When the city stopped using stop-and-frisk, they did not see an increase in crime, despite claims from its supporters that there would be a spike in criminal activity. Most people who had been subject to stop-and-frisk were let go, because they hadnât done anything wrong. Former US District Court Judge Shira Scheindlin, who had ruled the procedure unconstitutional in federal court, described it as âdestructiveâ in an interview with Buzzfeed. She added: âIn short, the overstopping in many communities harmed the relationship between the people and the police. Cooperation has now improved due to positive efforts by police to work with the community not against it.â 
In the past 3 or 4 days, the old Obama “Birther Claims” are again making headlines. This time is that candidate Donald Trump is attempting to close the door on it by saying that Barack Benito Milhous Hussein Obama (ht: Mark Levin) was born in the United States – period. You know it – the claim that Obama was born in Kenya and therefore not eligible to be president – the claim that was first implicitly floated by the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2007 and 2008. Yes, that one. It wasn’t Donald Trump who originally fired up the birther train. He just took it to ridiculous heights. It was actually a political stunt by Hillary Clinton’s chief strategist Mark Penn who wrote in 2007: “His [Obama] roots to basic American values and culture are at best limited. I cannot imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally American in his thinking and his values.” Penn also suggested how the campaign might take advantage of this. “Every speech should contain the line that you [Hillary] were born in the middle of America to the middle class in the middle of the last century,” he advised Clinton. “And talk about the basic bargain as about [sic] the deeply American values you grew up with, learned as a child, and that drive you today.” He went on: “Let’s explicitly own ‘American’ in our programs, the speeches and the values. He doesn’t … Let’s add flag symbols to the backgrounds [of campaign events].” So they’ve chosen the one straw man they can go to war against. A topic so utterly pointless at this time, the only question to be asked is – what is the point? Almost eight years into Obama’s reign and it’s being brought up again. There is no point, other than as a distraction – which is the point. Anything to get Clinton out of the… Read the rest of the story at www.iPatriot.com  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.
Another day, anotherÂ Trump controversy. While the media hyper-focuses on Hillary Clintonâs âpay-for-playâ scandal (that wasnât actually a scandal, just crappy reporting from the Associated Press), a report has found a major smoking gun regarding the Trump Foundation: Donald Trump spent more than a quarter-million dollars from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits that involved the billionaireâs for-profit businesses, according to interviews and a review of legal documents. Totaling over $258,000 in Foundation money, Trump may have been involved in has violated laws against Â what is known as âself-dealingâ (something Trump is used to) which prohibits nonprofit leaders from using their charityâs money to benefit themselves or their private businesses. So not only has the Trump Foundation been found to have illegally contributed to politicians, it has been found to be engaging in self-dealing. And people think the Clinton Foundation is immoral? Here are some of the examples: According to the : In those cases, tax experts said, Trump was not allowed to simply keep these items and display them in a home or business. They had to be put to a charitable use. He did not use the paintings nor the helmet for charitable use, but rather personal use. Which is, as tax experts and the laws say, is illegal. So turns out the only âcrookedâ one in this race is Donald Trump, and the only fraud isnât the Clinton foundation, but the Trump Foundation. Illegal contributions, illegal lawsuit payoffs, and personal gifts with other peopleâs money (for non charitable use). Of course, the Clinton campaign hit on the issue, saying Trump is aÂ âfraud who believes the rules donât apply to him, â and that âClearly the Trump Foundation is as much a charitable organization as Trump University is an institute of higher education.â Ouch. Letâs see Fox News and the Trump camp try to spin this. Simply put, Trump needs to be forced to pay back all that he stole from donors and all that was used illegally. And if doesnât, he should be prosecuted for being the fraud he is. 
Anyone with even a little bit of decency was outraged when GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump decided to tweet out an off the cuff invitation for Gennifer Flowers, the woman who was involved in an extramarital affair scandal with former President Bill Clinton in the 1980s, to be his guest at the first presidential debate. If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2016  The tweet was just another example of Trump’s lashing out when he feels slighted. Well, it seems that the Trump campaign realized what a sleazy and inappropriate move this was on the part of their candidate, and campaign surrogates and officials have been out in force to make sure that the whole world knows that Trump will not have Flowers there as his guest. Trump campaign manager number three and official Trump whisperer Kellyane Conway said of the ruckus: “We do not expect her to be a guest of the Trump campaign.” Conway went on to spew the bullshit excuse that there’s no way that Hillary will ever get under Trump’s skin: “Mr. Trump was putting them on notice that we could certainly invite guests that make it into the head of Hillary Clinton.” The thing is, this is just disgusting. Hillary made the PERSONAL decision to stay with her husband, as many women do, after he had an affair. This nonsense is decades old, and should be in no way relevant to the 2016 race for the White House. This is something that is a low blow, sexist and is in no way appropriate for a serious political campaign. Trump’s flirting with this invitation for Flowers to attend the debate is nothing more than a misogynist attempt to shame a woman for her personal decision to forgive the man she loves for mistakes within a marriage. In other words, it’s not appropriate to drag it up, and it is none of the public’s business. Further, it CERTAINLY has NOTHING to do with the current election. This is just one more example of Trump’s grossly ill-suited temperament when it comes to occupying the highest office in this great land and leading the free world. Watch Conway’s pathetic attempt to spin Trump’s bullshit on CNN below: Donald Trump's campaign: Gennifer Flowers will not be at the debate https://t.co/DKjtdolQ9J https://t.co/knX8rF0fRt — CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 25, 2016  Featured image via The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images  A student at a small Delaware college drew two cartoons that have many people upset.
I would say our President is useless, but really, this goes beyond useless and right into the realm of arrogance. He has done some pretty brain dead things in the past and has made some incredibly insensitive and idiotic statements but this? This is just tone deaf to the nth power.  I’m guessing that if you’re reading this right now, you keep up with the news, or at least have a tendency to follow breaking events. That being the case, you already know about the couple of bombings that happened in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, as well as the stabbing that occurred in St. Cloud, Minnesota. While you would think that this would be enough to prompt an immediate statement from our elected officials, you would be wrong. Surely you’d want to hear the man or woman you voted for stand in solidarity with the people against this kind of terrorism, especially on our own soil. Surely the men and women you elected would at least want to do that much, if not because they actually mean it, then for votes in the upcoming election. Well apparently your President doesn’t have any such feelings about the matter. In fact, not only did he not talk about the bombings while he was in New York, he ignored them in favor of speaking at a high-dollar fundraiser. Are you outraged yet? It gets better. In lieu of addressing the domestic terror that had just occurred, he lamented the “sexism” he says has been pushed by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Fox News (who has more female faces than any mainstream media outlet I’ve ever seen, including MSNBC), claiming that they are the reason Hillary Clinton’s campaign is going down the tubes. He bashed Trump while lauding Hillary as some kind of savior, while never mentioning the men and women who were injured in explosions that officials agree were terror-related. Critics will say that he didn’t have enough information to make an informed statement at the time, but you don’t have to know every single detail to say “an explosion has taken place here in New York and I would like to take a moment to recognize the people injured and offer them my thoughts and prayers, and would ask you guys to do the same. I will be making a more in-depth statement later as I receive more details.” And then move on to the business of the hour. But no, he couldn’t even be bothered to do that. Disgusting. 
NRA board member, draft-dodger, pedophile, and all-around terrible person Ted Nugent has a message for those âembarrassingâ and âpatheticâ victims of a recent mass-stabbing at a Minnesota mall â and itâs one that no decent person would even consider. On September 17,Â an attacker apparently affiliated with ISIS stabbed nine people at a mall in St. Cloud, Minnetota. He was eventually fatally shot by an off-duty police officer. Fortunately, the victimsâ injuries were not life-threatening â something most would celebrate, but Nugent deigns it appropriate to simply attack the victims because they didnât bring their guns to a knife-attack. In one of his traditionally hateful Facebook posts, Nugent unleashed on the victims in exactly the manner one would expect from a man who assumed legal custody of a 17-year-old girl so he could have sex with her. Calling the victims âsad soulless & embarrassing,â Nugent mocked them for being âso patheticâ and âhelpless,â remarking that âapparently most Americans like being victimsâ:  Previously, Nugent has attacked âlosersâ who donât carry guns after the mass shooting at Umpqua community College in Oregon last year, blaming them for being victims because they choose not to carry a security blanket firearm around. Nugent falsely claimed that students were not allowed to carry guns on campus because of laws and regulations, but Newsweek reported at the time that the campus wasÂ  a âgun-free zoneâ and that it was âcommon knowledgeâ many students were armed. âDisarmed and helpless is an irresponsible, suicidal choice that will get you killed,â Nugent disgustingly concluded. âDefend yourself.â Victim-blaming is a hallmark of the Right â something we can expect to see more and more of if Donald Trump is elected in November. Get out there and do something about it. 
Snopes.com has long been regarded as the gold standard for fact-checking internet myths, hoaxes and viral stories. When you see your friends share something that seems kind of crazy, you can visit Snopes and get the truth. Or can you? There have been allegations of liberal bias at Snopes. They only added political fact-checking to their site relatively recently and it is not often honest. Instead, it tends to be about putting liberal spin on issues that Democrats need to have covered. And now we know why: their lead fact-checker is a failed liberal blogger.   LaCapria originally tried to begin her blogging career at the Inquisitr, a site ironically known for its hoaxes, fake quotes and satire. She was not successful there, perhaps due to her open liberal bias. She referred to members of the Tea Party as “teahadists,” for example. So of course, that bias bleeds over into her “fact checking.” Take Facebook, for example. It’s known now that Facebook employees were made to hide conservative stories that were trending. LaCapria, however, discounted this as just “rumors.” When Hillary made her, “We didn’t lose a single person in Beghazi” gaffe, LaCapria dismissed that as well, suggesting that Hillary was referring to a 2011 invasion, rather than the 2012 attack.   It goes on and on with LaCapria and at Snopes in general. While they may do a good job at debunking UFO rumors and internet hoaxes, they perhaps should leave politics alone, as they clearly can’t leave their bias at the door. 
The FBI investigation of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal, where they acknowledged criminal activity yet refused to charge her anyway, has ignited a firestorm of criticism… and it looks like FBI Director James Comey might be the first casualty when heads start to roll. Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary’s top aides, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination. Now, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey’s fate.   Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. “This now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director’s fitness for office,” DiGenova said. He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills’ computer. “The contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity,” he said. “This was not a real investigation. This was a ‘protected investigation’ designed to look like an investigation.” DiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently, they listened. This week, Comey will have to answer for his behavior.   Will Congress hold Comey responsible for this joke of an investigation? He isn’t just having to face a hearing; he’s been issued a subpoena from Congress, too. Congress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton’s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. In a further attempt to get Comey to comply, Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents. How loyal is Comey to Hillary, really? Is he really willing to lose his career or even go to prison to cover for her? And if the answer to that question is “yes,” then the new question becomes… why? 
Fox News host Megyn Kelly seemed to take a shot at Sean Hannity on Monday night after the much anticipated first presidential debate when she had to throw the live coverage to an interview between her colleague and Republican nominee Donald Trump. Hannity has been a prime target for just about everyone ever since Trump was formally nominated during the last night of the Republican National Convention in July. Former host Jon Stewart got the ball rolling that night by torching Hannity for being a complete hypocrite when it comes to how he has covered President Obama in the past to how he treats Donald Trump now. Not long after that, foreign affairs columnist Bret Stephens called Hannity the “dumbest anchor on Fox News,” and the followed up by calling Hannity out for lying about Trump coming to the rescue of U.S. Marines. Then CNN’s Brian Stelter piled on by nailing Hannity for lying about Hillary Clinton, and reporter Kurt Eichenwald slammed Hannity for claiming that Hillary suffers seizures. And now Hannity is getting shade from one of his own colleagues. During the post-debate analysis on Fox News, Kelly had to introduce Hannity’s interview with Donald Trump. And as she introduced the interview, Kelly wondered if Trump would be talking to the actual journalists in the room afterward. ”We’ve got Trump speaking to our own Sean Hannity. We’ll see whether he speaks to the journalists in this room after that interview.” Here’s the video via YouTube.  Trump and Hannity proceeded to trash Hillary Clinton, but it looks like the main focus will be on Kelly for basically telling a lying commentator like Hannity to go f*ck himself. And he definitely deserved the shade. After all, Hannity is not a real journalist. He ignores facts and peddles bullshit and frankly shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near the airwaves. Hannity is Trump’s puppet and he clearly cannot be fair and balanced as the network he works for advertises. 
UPDATE: It just keeps getting better. Keith Lamont Scott’s mother, Vernita Scott Walker, said the man was reading…the Koran before he was shot. Ya can’t make this stuff up folks! Why isn’t the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Chief of Police, Kerr Putney, going to release the video of the altercation between police and Keith Lamont Scott? According to the chief, it is clear that Scott had a gun. But then he back tracked saying: “The video does not give me absolute, definitive, visual evidence that would confirm that a person is holding a gun.” So what does that mean? From his declaration, there is but one conclusion we can make in confidence – that Scott did in fact have a handgun. Evidently other evidence and witness accounts support the police narrative that officers opened fire only after Scott refused to drop his weapon, so he did in fact have a weapon. It was neither holstered nor in his waistband. He was in fact holding the weapon. It was not a book he was holding as “witnesses and family” have claimed. Therefore, since the weapon was drawn, Scott must have intended to use it. Yet leftist websites and news outlets like the Huffington Post, drew a different conclusion from chief Putney’s statement. They claim that, “He [Putney] did however, note that the video fails to establish that Scott was holding a gun when he was shot.” This is absolutely NOT what the Chief said. Putney obviously chose his words very carefully. We don’t know why – just that he did. Watching the video of that segment of the press conference, adds further context to his statement. As he is explaining that there is “no definitive evidence” that “a person” is pointing a gun, he uses his hand to… Read the rest of the story at www.iPatriot.com  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.
If Donald Trump has his way, the constitutional right to due process will only belong to white racists. In the wake of the bombing in New York City over the weekend, police were able to apprehend a suspect named Ahmad Khan Rahami after a shootout. Rahami was hit and needed to be hospitalized to get his gunshot wound treated. And as an American citizen, he is also guaranteed the right to an attorney even if he cannot afford one. Why? Because the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the Constitution say so. But Republican nominee Donald Trump thinks the amendments should be scrapped in Rahamiâs case. You know, because heâs a Muslim. During a rally in Florida on Monday, Trump whined because Rahami is being treated in a hospital for his wound and further complained about him being represented by a competent defense attorney. âNow we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world. He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And heâll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer. His case will go through the various court systems for years and in the end, people will forget and his punishment will not be what it once would have been. What a sad situation.â Trump, who advocates for torture techniques, also demanded a speedy trial resulting in âharsh punishmentâ and suggested using âwhatever lawful methods are available to obtain information from the apprehended suspect to get information before itâs no longer timely.â Hereâs the video via YouTube.  The Fifth Amendment states: No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand juryâ¦nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation. Rahami is innocent until proven guilty. So not letting him get the treatment he needs could lead to him dying from an infection or loss of blood, thus depriving him of life without due process. Furthermore, the Sixth Amendment clearly gives everyone the right to an attorney, even a bombing suspect. In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense. The right to have an attorney is one of the most foundational values of the country, most exemplified by Founding Father John Adams, who defended the British soldiers who were arrested after the Boston Massacre in 1770. In short, it doesnât matter who the suspect is or what they did, they have the right to due process and an attorney in this country. But Donald Trump apparently wants to put a âwhiteâs onlyâ sign on the Constitution. 
The Bloomberg network will run a live, on-screen fact check during tonight’s presidential debate, breaking precedent with other networks. Politico reported Monday morning that Bloomberg would be verifying the factual accuracy of statements by both Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump in real time on the screen. Other networks have opted out of doing a live fact check, mostly because it would be too difficult. The Clinton campaign has called repeatedly for a live fact check of the debate in anticipation of Trump’s penchant for making unverifiable claims on live TV. “For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage,” said Clinton Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri in a conference call with reporters. “We do believe it is the role of the moderator . . . to call out those lies and to do that in real time.” This would largely leave it up to moderator Lester Holt to call out each candidate when making a false statement. However, this could prove too controversial for Holt, who would invite criticism much in the same way CNN’s Candy Crowley did in 2012, when she interrupted Mitt Romney on the topic of the Banghazi attacks while moderating a debate between Romney and President Barack Obama. However, not correcting a candidate when he or she misstates the facts can also stir up controversy. The most recentl example of that is Today Show anchor Matt Lauer choosing not to interject during one of Donald Trump’s responses to his questions, when the GOP nominee said he never supported the Iraq War (he did). And while networks have said they would fact-check each candidates’ statements in followup pieces to run the following day, it still essentially frees up both candidates to lie without being interrupted. The debate, which will take place at Hofstra University in New York, airs at 9 PM Eastern tonight on CNN. Neither Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson nor Green Party nominee Jill Stein have been invited to join the debate. For her part, Stein will be hosting a livestream outside Hofstra University where she will be answering all questions asked by a live social media audience.            
Local Charlotte, NC news station WSOCTV is reporting that sources tell them dash cameras captured Keith Scott getting out of car and coming towards officers with a gun in his hand: #BREAKING: Sources tell Channel 9 dash camera video shows #KeithScott getting out car, coming toward officers with gun in his hand pic.twitter.com/GGuM2Ow3wk — WSOCTV (@wsoctv) September 21, 2016  For a second night, protests over a deadly officer-involved shooting in Charlotte, North Carolina, turned violent, with police firing tear gas and demonstrators throwing objects and trying to damage vehicles. Keith Lamont Scott, a father of seven, was killed by police in an apartment complex parking lot Tuesday as officers looked for another man named in a warrant they were trying to serve. The shooting set off a long night of violent protests and Wednesday the demonstrations continued for a second night, starting off as a peaceful march through downtown Charlotte. But when the demonstrators neared an Omni Hotel, some people climbed the roof of an outdoor mall and started throwing objects at the crowd. Other people were banging on the doors of the hotel, and police in riot gear emerged in the entrance. His family said Scott, an African-American, was unarmed and sitting in his car reading a book, waiting for his son to come home from school. But Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said Scott exited his car with a gun, not a book. He said officers couldn’t find a book at the scene. “It’s time for the voiceless majority to stand up and be heard,” said the police chief, who is black. “It’s time to change the narrative because I can tell you from the facts that the story’s a little bit different as to how it’s been portrayed so far, especially through social media.” – CNN But…b…b…but what about the book?

She says he had a book. @wsoctv pic.twitter.com/X1PWw5QJ7O — Mark Barber (@MBarberWSOC9) September 21, 2016  And of course, there’s Hillary’s irresponsible tweet confirming that the cops were in the wrong, without even having any facts to back up her ignorant statement: Keith Lamont Scott.

Everyone knows Arnold Palmer as being a spectacular golfer and the inventor of a drink that is a mix of lemonade and iced tea. (I personally thank him for the last one, because I am in love with Arnold Palmers, especially in the summer months.)  Aside from being a great athlete, Palmer was also a great American, as evidenced by his comments about the Star Spangled Banner. “We don’t play ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ enough during the matches, and that is one of the things I think we need to do,” Palmer said then. “It’s a patriotic situation, and it belongs to both sides,” Palmer added. These comments came after the National Football League saw the beginning of the sitting protests that have sparked so much outrage. This weekend, we saw DeSean Jackson of the Washington Redskins greet our National Anthem with a raised fist, which is being used as a symbol of solidarity with the black community. He later made a statement on Instagram: “No matter how much or what we stand 4 as black people this will continue to happen , another Love 1 is taking from his family and killed unarmed , when will this s— stop , this man was shot & killed for what ?? Was he a threat ?? Us as black People are a threat , so jus take our lives smh the system been set up for us not to live and make it thru all this Bull—- another RIP #terrencecrutcher but they say have faith & trust ?? In what Them to keep killing our love 1’s,” he posted. The Giants played Washington that weekend and all of the players stood for the anthem. Later, he questioned whether these gestures on the field are actually being turned into actions. “Does anybody want to resolve the issues? That’s what we have to find out,” said running back Rashad Jennings. “We’re talking about gestures. The gesture of taking a knee, the gesture of posting something (on social media). Those are all gestures. It’s whether the actions are taking place,” he said. We need more athletes like Palmer who love their sport and love the country that has made their life and lifestyle possible. 
A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros. They have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice. So, WHY then is Soros caught again?   Now a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough, they’re funded by Soros TOO! It’s called ‘Common Defense PAC’ and their mantra is: “As veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump.” Then on the ‘leadership team’ page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. On their social media you see the same stuff. They feature videos and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros. Common Defense PAC shared one of its own anti-Trump video ads, which has a Common Defense PAC logo on it at the end, right underneath a URL link to a MoveOn.org petition called “Senator Portman: Disavow Donald Trump.” The PAC routinely promotes the Twitter hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which is also promoted routinely by MoveOn.org. MoveOn.org’s Political Action arm has also put out advertising for the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag. The Common Defense PAC logo also shows up on an image on the web page for a Thunderclap campaign called #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump.” The campaign had a social media reach of more than 4.5 million people and was supported by actor Mark Ruffalo and leftist pundit Van Jones. MoveOn.org was listed as the organizer of the Thunderclap campaign. MoveOn.org and Common Defense PAC worked together on a live protest to pressure John McCain to “un-endorse Donald J. Trump.” ThinkProgress reported on August 4th that veterans “came to the Capitol to deliver McCain a petition, organized by progressive group MoveOn.org in conjunction with veterans group Common Defense PAC, calling for him to revoke his support for the Republican presidential nominee.” Common sense PAC’s July quarterly filing report with the FEC lists ONLY one donor: a Baltimore IT consultant named Marjorie Roswell who gave $20,000 on June 30th. And then the group’s Director, Perry O’Brien has been a longtime left-wing activist. His ‘Iraq Veterans Against the War’ bio describes him: Perry O’Brien served as a medic in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division and was discharged as a conscientious objector in 2004. For several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors. He has been an active member of Iraq Veterans Against the War, and was a key organizer of Winter Soldier: Iraq and Afghanistan. The PAC that’s suppose to be Veterans against Trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector. You can hardly call that a veteran, right? O’Brien personally started a MoveOn.org petition called “Tell GOP leaders to disavow Trump and his attacks on veterans.” The petition is probably what grabbed Soros attention to get O’Brien to start the shallow PAC. With all of these shell groups being created solely to destroy Trump and funded by Soros, do you think that Trump stands a chance against the Left? 
In a powerful statement, a University of Nebraska football player opened up about the racism he experienced in response to kneeling during the national anthem. Before their game with Northwestern this past Saturday, Nebraska Cornhuskers players Michael Rose-Ivey, DaiShon Neal, and Mohamed Berry all took a knee during the national anthem in a silent protest of police brutality, as NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and other athletes across the country have done. In a press conference with local media on Monday, Rose-Ivey detailed the horrific racism he experienced as a result of his protest. “I am still referred to on Facebook and Twitter as a ‘clueless, confused nigger’ by former high school classmates, peers, and even [Nebraska] Husker fans. Some believe DaiShon, Mohamed, and myself should be kicked off the team or suspended, while some say we deserve to be lynched or shot just like other black people who have died recently,” Rose-Ivey said. “Another believe that since we didn’t want to stand for the anthem, that we should be hung before the anthem before the next game,” he added, after a long pause. However, Rose-Ivey said he felt obligated to take a knee, saying he was using his platform on the roster of one of the nation’s most prestigious college football programs to bring awareness to the injustice suffered by black Americans on a daily basis. “While you may disagree with the method, these reactions underscore the need for these protests and gives us just a small glimpse into the problem of racism in this country and the divisive mentality of some Americans,” Rose-Ivey said. “As Dr.King said, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. the hottest place in hell is reserved for those who remain neutral in times of great moral conflict. An individual who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.” Mohamed Barry told the Omaha World-Herald that while the players experienced racism, the overwhelming majority of responses were positive. “Our fans, they agree with it, they see the injustice, and for the most part they support us,” Barry said. However, if Rose-Ivey’s passionate statement is any indicator, the silent protest during the national anthem won’t stop anytime soon. “There are issues in this country that need to be addressed. There are issues in this country that can no longer be pushed off onto the backs of another generation.” Watch the full video of Michael Rose-Ivey’s statement below:             
Perhaps I’m in the minority here, but I didn’t see a “clear winner” from the debate. Hillary Clinton was scripted and robotic as ever. Donald Trump was a more restrained version of himself. I feel like there were so many missed opportunities on his part. He should’ve brought up the Clinton Foundation. He should’ve slammed Hillary after she accused him of being a sexist. He should’ve hammered her on Benghazi. Still, there were no major gaffes, so that’s a relief. And honestly, I think Donald Trump will perform even better in the next debate. He has a good feel for it now and will probably make sure he doesn’t let opportunities slip away. Still, some say there was a clear winner. Here are the results from a series of online polls. Drudge Report:  Time:  Breitbart:  The Hill:  Here’s where it gets really interesting: CNBC:  ABC:  Obviously, online polls aren’t scientific (sample sizes vary and aren’t always reflective of the population and so on), but STILL. She’s behind Gary Johnson and Jill Stein in ABC’s online poll. If that’s not embarrassing, I don’t know what is.
There’s a reason far-left, progressive whack job Senator Elizabeth Warren was given the nickname Fauxcohantas. She’s as phony as a $3 bill. Warren earned that nickname after it was discovered that she lied for years about being part Native American, then when confronted, she touted her “Pow Pow’s” high cheekbones as evidence that he was Native American. She rails against Wall Street when she has made millions because of Wall Street. Warren went after Donald Trump when it was reported that he made money flipping houses without disclosing that she has done the same. We should be used to Warren’s feigning outrage because she does so when it is politically expedient. That leads to the Senate hearing today in which Warren grilled the CEO of Wells Fargo, John Stumpf, over thousands of workers being caught setting up fake accounts in order to earn bonuses. Wells Fargo has since fired those workers and said that there could be more people let go if they discover further shenanigans. But that wasn’t enough for Fauxcohantas. She had to get up on her hypocritical high horse when the cameras were running to score her political talking points. Although the individuals who actually bilked the customers out of money were fired, Warren has the audacity to chastise the Wells Fargo CEO because senior executives were not fired accusing him of “gutless leadership.” “You haven’t fired a single senior executive. Instead, evidently, your definition of accountable is to push the blame to low-level employees who don’t have the money for a fancy PR firm to defend themselves. It’s gutless leadership.” Where were these words from Elizabeth Warren when Barack Obama blamed low-level IRS employees in Cincinnati for the IRS targeting, harassing, and intimidation of conservative and Tea Party groups? Where were these tough words when it turned out people at the top not only knew what was going on but orchestrated it? Where was Fauxcohontas when Lois Lerner was able to retire with a cushy pension and faced absolutely no repercussions for her hand in the scandal. Where was Warren when Obama lied to the American people in an interview with Bill O’Reilly before the Super Bowl when he said there wasn’t a smidgen of corruption? And did Elizabeth Warren demand that VA executives who were keeping fake log books in order to get bonuses be fired? Did she go on record of accusing Barack Obama of “gutless leadership” for his failure to fire anyone when it came to the VA scandal or the IRS scandal? Did she say Obama created the environment for such despicable practices to occur, practices which led to the death of hundreds of veterans and impact on the livelihood of Americans who were simply practicing their First Amendment rights in criticizing their government? No. Elizabeth Warren didn’t say a damn word about those things. Why? Because it would not have been politically expedient. Yes, there’s a reason Elizabeth Warren was given the nickname “Fauxcahontas.” She’s a big, filthy, hypocritical fake and political opportunist. That was exposed and made perfectly clear with her rant against the Wells Fargo CEO. Watch Elizabeth “Fauxcahontas” Warren in all her hypocritical glory.   Email Subscribe

Too bad The Media (D) didn’t stick around to hear it. These people LOVED Trump. They cheered for him, he sat quietly as they told their stories.  It was an absolute love-in. That would have chafed the media badly enough. But the audience had something ELSE in common. Complaints against the Clintons, who — to hear these people tell it — once they got their money, were never seen again. It turns out, they’re not very popular for their handling of Haiti. The have evidence they want to see followed up on. Against the Clintons. Does any of this sound familiar? Lots of the money sent to ‘Help” Haiti didn’t ever reach the poor people. They claim it found its way back to Washington Lobbyists. And then to the White House. Then there was how they claim Hillary screwed over the Poor People of Haiti. Haiti wanted to raise DAILY minimum wage from $3 to $5 a day. Hillary put an end to it. When it was obvious that the audience was piling on Hillary, and had nothing but love for Trump? There was no news there ‘worth reporting’… nothing to make Trump look silly, or racist, or hated. So they left early. The camera followed them out of the room, scurrying like the rats they are. BUSTED! Share if this is MORE proof that they should register as a Democrat Lobby Group. 
People always think that bad things happen to “other people.” If we’re lucky, we float through life never having to endure harrowing situations of life and death. However, too often, “regular” folks become the target of criminals. Citizens are mugged walking down the street; they are awoken by shattering glass as their suburban castle is violated by intruders. While many people throughout the world must suffer at the hands of criminals, Americans enjoy the right to bear arms and are afforded the right to defend themselves.   Early Friday morning, three armed men broke into a home in Georgia. A surveillance camera was running and authorities have released the tape to encourage the apprehension of two of the suspects. In the below footage, the trio breaks into a home filled with boxes. The occupant, a woman who reportedly is a restaurant manager who had stacked supplies for the restaurant in the home, can be seen promptly coming out of the bedroom in her pajamas with guns blazing. She began firing on the suspects almost immediately and as bullets ripped through the drywall, the robbers returned fire as they ran for their lives. One man even jumped through a window to escape the barrage of bullets. The Georgia woman kept firing and firing and even shot as they ran out the front door. One suspect was found dead on the driveway. After she ran out of ammo, the woman called 911 to report the incident. Police reported that the woman acted in accordance with the law in that she acted to defend herself and her property. Two of the suspects remain at large, but they did not cover their faces and it is likely that someone may recognize one or both of the criminals. The video is an extraordinary example of the importance of the Second Amendment. The left hates the fact that Americans have the right to defend themselves. Evidently, they would rather this article read, “Innocent woman slain in her home.”   
Liberals are constantly talking about how Islam is the religion of peace and tolerance. The reality is far more disturbing. Liberals also like to whine about how intolerant people are in regards to LGBT rights, yet they completely ignore where the real intolerance and oppression towards gay people lies. The Islamization of Europe is proving just how wrong liberals are on both counts. European liberals welcomed thousands upon thousands of Muslim refugees into their countries, and the results have been near catastrophic. Sharia law has been creeping across Europe, and for people who are hated by Islam, that’s truly worrying. A sad example is a despicable attack on a gay man in Brighton, England. On Sunday, Aaron Woods was walking down the street with his friend, Brian Markintosh. According to Markintosh, they were approached by a man who started screaming homophobic slurs at Woods. But it only got worse — the man then started physically attacking Woods, punching him in the face. Markintosh said the attacker “was shouting all this Muslim stuff … Aaron was in so much pain. He was really screaming.” He continued, “He’s such a gentle giant. He’s the kindest person you could imagine — this geezer broke his jaw with a knuckleduster. He was filming the young gay guys.”  This wasn’t the first attack on gay people, either. Earlier this month, a similar attack took place, when a gay couple was attacked by two men. Is it merely a coincidence that the increase of Muslims in Europe has since an increase in homophobic attacks? The truth is that since the Muslim migrants have entered Europe, there has been a huge increase in crime. From attacks on gay people to sexual assault, Europe is in a bad spot right now. The homophobic attacks are easily explained: sharia law teaches that homosexuality is a sin punishable by death. ISIS, for example, is known to kill gay people in brutal ways, such as throwing them from the tops of buildings. It’s no surprise that an increase in Muslims would make Europe more dangerous for gay Europeans. The question is, will any liberals be honest enough to admit it? Or will they continue to deny the obvious and put people’s lives at risk? 
Legendary athlete Michael Jordan made a statement about the racial violence and tension with there law enforcement community.   Jordan said, “As a proud American, a father who lost his own dad in a senseless act of violence, and a black man, I have been deeply troubled by the deaths of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement. And angered by the cowardly and hateful targeting and killing of police officers. I grieve with the families who have lost loved ones, as I know their pain all too well.” He went on, “I was raised by parents who taught me to love and respect people regardless of their race or background, so I am saddened and frustrated by the divisive rhetoric and racial tensions that seem to be getting worse as of late. I know this country is better than that, and I can no longer stay silent. We need to find solutions that ensure people of color receive fair and equal treatment AND that police officers—who put their lives on the line every day to protect us all—are respected and supported.” Jordan went on to talk about and praise law enforcement and how they have helped and protected him and his family in the past. But, he also acknowledged the fact that many African Americans do not feel the same way and have had a tremendously different experience with police that is not necessarily positive. The most touching part of his statements was when he called for change and for everybody to work together to attain that outcome. The star finished by saying, “To support that efforts, I am making contributions of $1 million each to two organizations, the International Association of Chiefs of Police’s newly established Institute for Community-Police Relations and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Although I know these contributions alone are not enough to solve the problem, I hope the resources will help both organizations make a positive difference.” People on Twitter and social media were quick to call him an Uncle Tom saying that his money was not needed and won’t make a difference. What he did though is highly profound. Not only did he acknowledge that yes, there is a problem in which African Americans are disproportionately discriminated against by police, he also acknowledged that most police officers are good people and deserve to be safe, healthy, and respected. He is able to come at it from both angles. And he put his money where his mouth is by donating a significant portion of money. A man of talk and action. Which is what is missing. Everyone talks but no one takes action. He did just that. Unlike another person who shall remain unnamed.. cough cough (Colin Kaepernick). He is able to see both sides and as an African American man who says that he will likley have a far greater impact than if a white man said it. It’s the voices of our friends we listen  to most. Whether we want to admit it or not, black people don’t want to hear white people preaching about racism. But when a black man says something they are more apt to listen. 
I…can’t…even. This is absolute madness and as hard as I’m trying to process this nonsense in my head, I just can’t wrap my brain around it. I have no doubt that things are about to get really messy. I cannot say that I don’t understand the Judge after reading the report. There are some black Americans that have a legit fear of Police Officers and their first instinct is to run. It’s just… is this really the only way to remedy that? There are two sides to this coin, and the judge is only reviewing one of them. It’s going to blow up in his face. In Massachusetts, a judge just ruled a special law into play for black males. This ruling came from Supreme Court, therefore… it stands as is without appeal. The problem is, are the citizens of MA now in more danger because of it? You be the judge of that. The job of a Police Officer is a whole other level of “all things dangerous” then any civilian could ever imagine. They are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position. It’s not possible. You can only live that life, to understand that life. That fact, just makes the brutal attack on them, even more unfair. As if their job wasn’t already hard enough in Obama’s America, now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of Massachusetts. If they feel that they are being “disproportionately” targeted, they can run. Yes, run from the Police Officer, who now can do nothing about it. To add to that, the fact that they ran, cannot be used against them in court either. Up until now, if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime, that’s “reasonable suspicion” and used as reason for a Police Officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate. Now, it’s not important to get evidence when it’s fresh, because it could hurt a thug’s feelings. Basically, Police who exist to protect and serve, can no longer truly protect or serve…if there’s a runner. Which…let’s be real, what thug doesn’t run? Punchline: The law abiding ones! I’m so funny. You’re welcome. 
When George H.W. Bush endorsed Hillary Clinton, quite a few people stumbled in their tracks. The progressives see this as a justification of their agenda and a feather in the cap of their candidate. The conservatives see it as a betrayal and a mystery. Pat Caddell has dug up the root of the problem. It is old fashioned protection of the inside the beltway elite. Trump and Sanders have led the revolution, so their power base is endangered.  Read and then click the link at the bottom of the post and listen!!  As Written By Dan Riehl for Breitbart: Long-time Democratic pollster Pat Caddell joinedBreitbart News DailySiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday to discuss recent polling, as well as news that former President George H.W. Bush may be voting for Democrat Hillary Clinton. “This is a protection racket here, and they have never been under greater threat,” said Caddell, referencing the candidacy of GOP nominee Donald Trump. “It’s not surprising in a way,” he continued. “We misunderstand that this Trump thing is not so much an ideological contest, even a partisan contest. It’s really an insurgency against the political class by the people. That’s why both Bernie Sanders and Trump did so well” in their respective primaries. Added Caddell, “Behind closed doors, what you have is a sense of an alliance,” pointing out that while one party may be up and the other down at times, they still “eat at the same trough” in Washington. Caddell went on to discuss recent polling, as well as what to expect going forward. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern…..

Black Lives Matter released their platform last month that calls for defunding police departments, race-based reparations, voting rights for illegal immigrants, fossil-fuel divestment, an end to private education and charter schools, a “universal basic income” and free college for blacks. Based on this platform it is obvious that ‘black people’ don’t have parents or families to teach them how to take care of themselves and their own needs.   Based on that ‘platform’ it comes as no surprise that Black Lives Matter got upset when an unofficial BLM chapter held a protest that turned into a cookout with the local police. The BLM made sure to denounce the chapter and event immediately:  THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL #BlackLivesMatter CHAPTER! THIS IS NOT IN LINE WITH OUR PRINCIPLES. @Blklivesmatter https://t.co/IIlnTbgE1S — BlackLivesMatter DC (@DMVBlackLives) July 20, 2016   Trying to heal the wounds of a nation and come together by working together is NOT the goal of Black Lives Matter. In their tweet and many conversations about the event thereafter, they have revealed that their goal is destruction. They want to rip apart America by creating a divide between races which is essentially the goal of their major donor, George Soros. Soros is known for disrupting the economies of nations to profit from the unrest. This is why the major Black Lives Donor has given at least $33 Million in grants to Black Lives Matter through his Open Society Foundation and from the Center For American Progress. Soros funded political movement, Occupy Wallstreet, didn’t have the bones and anger to rip apart America because it was a bunch of people who don’t want to work. But the black community is a huge part of the thread of what is America. Soros’ attempt to create a massive racial divide between ‘white and black’ on the backs of familial deaths in the black community and blaming it on society instead of the individual looks like a winning movement. To disallow communities to try and heal that divide is contrary to Soros’ plan. What happened in the Wichita, Kansas community was an attempt to close that divide. KSNW, the NBC affiliate station covering the area, said that the event, which was hosted by the Sunflower Community Action group, wasn’t just a lighthearted celebration — it was a way for the community to reach out to its police department to discuss issues surrounding police-community relations. The Wichita Eagle reported that “At one table, three men – a black man, a Hispanic man and a white man – sat down with burgers next to Lt. Travis Rakestraw to share their ideas.” Black Lives Matter later responded to their initial tweet that the event was against BLM principles saying, “Our statement about BLM BBQ’s with police was a direct response to the tons of people and orgs who were upset by the event. We assured folks our principles were still focused on dismantling the system.” Dividing people by race, gender, age and religion is the key to dismantling the system. The ‘cops’ are the enforcers of ‘the system’ which is called RULE OF LAW. Without rule of law you will have dismantled the melting pot that is America. Who will survive the anarchy that Black Lives Matter are working for? Who is most likely to lose out? Inner-cities are most likely to lose out if anarchy replaces rule of law.  To end police brutality you have to end the police. — Brotha B (@BlakeDontCrack) July 22, 2016   
Even though Donald Trump (sort of) dropped the âbirtherâ issue, thereâs one pro-Trump surrogate who â in the tightest re-election fight of his life â is still pledging to continue his investigation into President Obamaâs birth certificate. Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was recently recommended for criminal court due to the continuation of racial profiling and perjury, told a group of Tea Party activists that he is certain Barack Obamaâs birth certificate is forged and will do everything he can to prove it: âIâm not going to give up, and weâre looking into it. I donât know how itâs going to turn out.Â I donât care where heâs from.Â We are looking at a forged document.Â Period.Â I had nothing to do with Trump on the birth certificate. We did it on our own, because of you guys.â The room of 200 or so activists were of course energized by Arpaioâs pledge to unleash the âtruth.â Before speaking to the crowd, Arpaio told reporters that it was the Tea Party activists in Maricopa County that got him âstuckâ with the birther issue after World Net Daily, a right-wing publication known for conspiracy theories, had a reporter speak to another group, and subsequently gathered almost 250 signatures demanding Arpaio investigate. He complied, launching his investigation last week. According to Arizona Central: Mike Zullo, the lead investigator on the case andÂ commander of Arpaioâs Cold Case Posse, told the crowd that he knew Trumpâs statement was a âpunch in the gut, because it was unexpected.âÂ Zullo said he thought Trumpâs statement was âstrategic.âÂ âItâs not going to deter us,â Zullo said. âItâs not going to stop us. I am closer than ever.â Zullo also claims that a nurse who worked at the hospital where President Obama was born, theÂ Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu, denies that such a birth ever happened. Well there you have it. Not only are Maricopa County residents footing the bill for Arpaioâs legal woes (yet again), they are now paying for another âinvestigationâ into President Obamaâs birth certificate. Is this what Republicans mean by âfiscal responsibility?â In Maricopa County, there are almost 4.2 million taxpaying citizens. And now they are paying their Sheriffâs office their tax dollars to âinvestigateâ some fringe conspiracy supported by 250 activists. Think about that. Maybe thatâs why Arpaio is losing his re-election bid to a Democrat, Paul Penzone, and it might also explain why his poll numbers are plummeting. Good thing heâs focusing on the issues that matter. 
Mexicoâs former President, Vicente Fox, isnât shy at all about his disdain for Republican nominee Donald Trump â and he really turned things up a notch after last nightâs presidential debate. Anyone who watched the debate (or has access to the internet) knows by now that Trump blew it. His performance was so weak and he was so unprepared, even Republican pundits have admitted that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won by a landslide â and Fox wasnât afraid to point this out. On Tuesday, Fox decided to go after Trump while itâs going to hurt the most, knowing full well that the business mogulâs ego is likely suffering from embarrassment. On Twitter, Fox teased Trump mercilessly for his horrendous performance, directly asking Trump âwhat does losing feel like?â on Twitter. To rub this in even more, Fox posted a screenshot of one of Trumpâs pathetic fundraising emails, proving to the world that Trumpâs campaign is still struggling and begging for money: [email protected] you have no shame, I just got another e-mail begging for help. Tell me what does losing feels like? Have a little dignity!â @realDonaldTrump you have no shame, I just got another e-mail begging for help. Tell me what does losing feels like? Have a little dignity! pic.twitter.com/avrV9WKG9T â Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) September 27, 2016  Continuing to pourÂ salt into the wound, Fox also praised Clinton for showing âcapacity, compassion and wisdomâ while bashing Trump for looking âafoul.â The attack was brutal: Twitter Twitter Itâs been awhile since Fox has been in the media for attacking Trump, but he sure knows how to make an appearance. This election cycle, the former President of Mexico has repeatedly made headlines for slamming Trump and publicly stating that Mexico willÂ not pay for hisÂ âf*cking wall.âÂ Fox has also said that Trump âreminds me of Hitlerâ and even challenged Trump to a debate once (which Trump was too cowardly to accept). We can only expect that over the next few weeks, Fox is going to support Clinton to the fullest, and do whatever he can to convince Americans not to vote for Trump. 
So I guess it is back to school for everyone.  I am not really too sure, as the last time I was in a classroom they actually taught curriculum that benefitted students.  I saw an interesting article in Breitbart today which read: “Northwestern President: Critics of Safe Spaces, Trigger Warnings are ‘Lunatics'”.   The article, which appeared in Northwestern University’s student rag newspaper, The Daily Northwestern, was based on a speech given by NU President Morton Schapiro.  I know that listening to libtards is enough to make any of my readers lose their lunch, so I will simply hit the high points.  In his speech Schapiro said: “The people who decry safe spaces do it from their segregated housing places, from their jobs without diversity — they do it from their country clubs. It just drives me nuts.” And about microaggression, what did this academic sainte have to say? “Microaggressions cut you to the core and aren’t easily forgotten…” Ok, first things first: According to his bio, Morton Schapiro has never worked a day in his life outside of academics.  While his resume might sound impressive it has all been in schools and colleges.  This is important because it means that he has nothing in common with the students that will eventually have to graduate his college and, gasp in horror, find a job. Dr. Schapiro told students that ““Look for those safe spaces. If you can’t find them, we will help you find them.”  Alright, call me a sadist, but I would love to be a fly on the wall when one of NU’s students goes into a job interview and starts talking about safe spaces.  Hey buttercup, the real world doesn’t have those!  What are you going to do, little snowflake, when you meet a co-worker or even a boss who says things that you consider “microaggressive”?  Are you going to run to your safe space and hide in your blanket fort whilst sipping a juice box?  Are you going to sit there in a boardroom during a meeting and cry because someone said something that goes against what you believe?  If you can answer yes to both of those questions then you will not be employed for too long.  To survive in the real world you need a level of self discipline and a really, really tough skin.  The working world is tough, it’s a lot tougher when you are a wuss. The whole purpose of college is to prepare its students for the real world not only by teaching them academics that can get them jobs, but also by preparing them for a tough, cold world.  Well, at least that use to be its purpose.  Now the purpose of college is to brainwash and coddle, making spineless wimps out out of the strong and airheads out of the smart.  Today’s colleges are run by administrators and teachers who have never worked a day in the private sector.  They teach theory, not reality.   Students come out with student debts in the hundreds of thousands without the skills necessary to survive in the working world.  I shudder to think that these entitled wusses will someday be running the country. I motion that Northwestern University change its name to Wussy U.  And, if you don’t like it, I will be in my blanket fort, sipping my juice box. 
Yet another black female sailor declared that she would sit during the National Anthem. Janaye Ervin posted on Facebook her intentions and declared the Navy was punishing her for exercising her constitutional rights. The military is a realm unto its own. It is governed by military law and procedure. This woman has served in the Navy for eight years… she damn well knows that and is using a Marxist/terrorist tactic… she’s using our own freedoms against us. Ervin is in violation of Navy regulations. They require all uniformed personnel to stand at attention and face the ensign while the anthem is played. You do not get an exception because you are black. As John Bloomer pointed out, anyone has a right to protest, but action conducted as a protest does not grant immunity from the law or a pass on any social consequence. The discipline within the naval ranks is warranted on her actions or lack thereof.  From the Independent Review Journal: The national anthem protests — inspired by 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick — were just gathering steam when the first American military member raised eyebrows by joining in. Facebook community, US Army Military Police WTF Moments, posted video of the sailor, who said that she would not stand for the anthem “until the U.S. proves that they’ve got my back as a black woman”:   Although the Navy did speak to the sailor in the video, officials made it clear that she would not be separated from the service for her actions. Last week, as tensions increased following two highly publicized police shootings, another sailor came forward to say that she would be sitting out the national anthem as well:  Ervin also said that she intended to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States and to spread freedom and democracy around the world.” But she would do well to heed the observation of fellow African American Martin Baker who was reminded of something he was told in training: “I was told in basic training the simplest of phrases: we are here to preserve and defend democracy, not practice it. When you put the uniform on, you must put aside your personal feelings and remember at that moment you are a direct representative of the United States of America. You are, if need be, the advanced diplomacy of the American way of life. If at any time you feel you cannot stand and represent our flag and our nation even in something as simple as the anthem, you forfeit the right to wear that uniform.” That is exactly right and it goes right to the heart of her transgression. Ervin’s actions could also be considered ‘political speech’, which is also against military regulations. Because of these two incidents, the Navy has issued new guidelines: According to Navy Regulation 1205, personnel in uniform must stand at attention and face the flag when the national anthem is played. Navy active-duty personnel in civilian clothes will face the flag, stand at attention, and place their right hand over their heart. Additionally, Sailors will receive training on the appropriate usage of social media, and must not use it to discredit the Naval Service, and should be reminded it could potentially be used as evidence against them. While military personnel are not excluded from the protections granted by the First Amendment, the US Supreme Court has stated that the different character of our community and of the military mission requires a different application of those protections.” Neither of the sailors has been discharged… yet. But the new guidelines state that such actions will be punishable under Article 92 of the UCMJ and will be considered serious offenses — grounds for involuntary separation from the service. As they should. Don’t enlist if you can’t follow the military’s rules, regulations and laws. And if you can’t bring yourself to stand for the National Anthem, perhaps you should also find a different country where you have no issues with patriotism. 
Over the past several months, the American public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has taken place at the Clinton Foundation since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. Well, a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought. According to the Daily Caller, the foundation, AIDS program distributed “watered down” drugs to third-world countries. From The Daily Caller: Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. — The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. — The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign. — The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs. This latest report proves that the Clinton Foundation should be SHUT DOWN immediately rather than serve as a means of enriching Bill and Hillary! Do you think that the Clinton Foundation should be shut down immediately before it continues to harm more and more people around the world? Share your thoughts below!   
Scores of athletes have been protesting the National Anthem, refusing to stand and kneeling instead. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick kicked off the trend, claiming that he could not show respect to this country when he is so horribly “oppressed”. Many other athletes followed, in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement… and none of them faced any repercussions for their actions. But what happens if someone takes the opposite view, and openly opposes Black Lives Matter? Well, apparently, they get punished. Seattle Mariners catcher Steve Clevenger does not agree with the Black Lives Matter movement, and after the riots in Charlotte, he decided to make that known. He fired off a series of tweets that got a lot of attention. “BLM is pathetic once again! Obama you are pathetic once again! Everyone involved should be locked behind bars like animals!” he wrote. He followed that up with another tweet, writing, “Black people beating whites when a thug got shot holding a gun by a black officer haha shit cracks me up! Keep kneeling for the Anthem!”   Those tweets were deleted, but not before Clevenger set off a firestorm of criticism. And the Mariners were not pleased: they announced he would be suspended without pay for the rest of the season.   Clevenger has been sitting the bench since June due to an injury, but he still had a salary of $516,500 for the season. There are 10 days left in the season, which results in him losing just under $34,000. After being suspended, Clevenger released a statement apologizing for his tweets:   The question is, why is it unacceptable for Clevenger to express his opinion about Black Lives Matter, yet it’s acceptable for other athletes to protest in favor of them? 
It is an inarguable fact that law enforcement in the United States kill far too many citizens. Police officers in the United States have killed 706 people in summary executions without due process of the law; well on target to pass last year’s grisly total of 990. Our police officers shoot and kill people at a rate seventy times that of other developed countries, and that is absolutely unacceptable. The United Kingdom had 55 fatal police shootings in the past 24 years; American police murdered that many citizens in the first 24 days of 2015. The appalling frequency of unarmed black men being gunned down by overzealous police officers who don’t even bother to attempt to take them in peacefully prompts even more questions. Why are our cops so trigger-happy? One veteran thinks it may have something to do with their training.  The frequency of violence by American police officers can be partially blamed with the outrageous proliferation of firearms among a irresponsible civilian population leading to more cops being killed in the line of duty, as Republican nominee Donald Trump loves to spout – when he’s not busy telling you how Hillary Clinton is coming for your guns. But the number of deaths in the line of duty for police officers is down 17% since President Obama took office, hovering around 60 a year. Police departments cultivate this “shoot first and ask questions later” policy and have developed a wide array of tools to insulate themselves from facing consequences for their crimes. They do this to cover up the fact that the reality is that our police forces receive astonishingly poor training – less than is required to become a cosmetologist. A cosmetologist in Alabama requires 50 weeks of training. A soldier in Alabama completes ten weeks of basic training and then fifty-two weeks of advanced specialization training. A police officer in Alabama requires twelve weeks of training. On the other hand, a police officer in Norway requires two years of training. See the difference?
Hillary Clinton had a major slip up on Thursday. In a public video message to American laborers, Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton put her true personality on full display! It was just what would expect from the little she-devil: shrill, manic and apt to inspire shudders of trepidation in little children. “‘Why aren’t I 50 points ahead?’ you might ask,” Hillary bellowed like an asylum patient. “Well, the choice for working families has never been clearer. I need your help to get Donald Trump’s record out to everybody.” “Nobody should be fooled!” she snidely added in a voice so ear-splittingly loud that even deaf laborers most likely heard it. Throughout the rest of the video, she maintained that same flair — the unnecessary indignation for her opponent, GOP candidate Donald Trump. To her demise, instead of directing her rage at him, she inadvertently wound up unleashing it upon the very people she wanted to bubble her name in on the ballot. You can watch a snippet of the video below, just a tip, don’t watch it in front of your kids, lest they go to sleep tonight complaining about the “Hillary bogeywoman” hiding in their closets:  That is one frightening old lady!! Does she actually think that’s going to win her votes? Take note to this version of Hillary Clinton compared to the one usually seen of her. When speaking at campaign events or with the media, she attempts (rather unsuccessfully) to present herself as amiable, humble and, of course, likable.  The Hillary depicted in the clip above is much more like the version of her described by her former Secret Service escorts. Take for example former agent Gary Byrne, who described the former first lady as “erratic, uncontrollable and occasionally violent.” This Hillary definitely fits the bill of the heartless Benghazi murdering type we have read so much about! Even Byrne admitted that Hillary often screamed obscenities at Secret Service agents, White House staff and even her own husband, former President Bill Clinton. And everyone lived in fear of her next crazy outburst. That sounds spot on….  
A McDonough, Georgia Wal-Mart employee refused to make a Thin Blue Line cake for an officer’s retirement party and it sparked an online firestorm. The cake design was relatively simple, a black and white American flag with a blue stripe in it. I’m no pastry chef, but that seems fairly easy to me. Below is an example:  But it wasn’t the ease of the cake design that kept the bakers from fulfilling the order, it was the fact that “some could perceive it as racist.” The customer, the officer’s daughter, then thought she could receive a more favorable answer by asking for just a thin blue line on a chocolate background, but the baker said she wasn’t comfortable doing that either. Confused by the resistance to make such a cake, the daughter asked the baker, “Is there something wrong with cops?” A family friend, who is also an officer, posted about the incident on Facebook:  The manager of the Wal-Mart reached out to the woman to offer her a gift cart, party supplies as well as a cake, but the damage was done. The daughter had also gone to Kroger to have the cake made. The cake that the family received was poorly made and looked completely unprofessional, according to the daughter. A picture of the cake is below:  In an exclusive interview with Todd Starnes, the daughter said that if she refused a customer’s request, she would have been fired. “I work in retail,” the officer’s daughter told Starnes. “If I didn’t want to deal with a customer — and said ‘No’ — I would get fired.” So, let’s set something straight, conservatives have already made it very clear that nobody should be forced to make a cake that they object to and it’s true, they shouldn’t. The family here did what everyone should do and they moved on to another bakery that made the cake without objection. What also happened here is what should also happen, the public put pressure on the company to either stand up for what they did, or to cave and make the cake. The free market should take care of the public’s opinion on a business. If you refuse business for any reason and you’re in a non-emergency profession, you should be able to do so. And that person who you refused should be able to go out and express their opinion about your refusal, and the public should decide whether or not to continue to visit your business and spend their money there. If this Wal-Mart was in my area, I would refuse to shop there because I fundamentally disagree with the kind of people they hire. Just keep in mind that despite how much anger this story creates inside you, you should not fall into the trap of demanding someone comply with your desires.

Now it’s all ‘agenda politics’ and rushing for the scoop… even if it’s WRONG. ClashDaily asked the question. (Isn’t ‘Hispanic’ more of a liguistic term?) With social media, the revolt is well underway: A controversy began brewing Friday night when Mount Vernon police described the suspect in the Cascade Mall shooting as a Hispanic male in his late teens to mid-20s with a close-shaved haircut. By Saturday night, when police arrested Turkish immigrant Arcan Cetin in connection with the crime, it had reached a full boil on Twitter. Some observers were angry that police had wrongly put out the word to look for someone who was Hispanic and that many media outlets — including The Seattle Times — repeated the description. Laura Martínez tweeted, “BREAKING: Cable networks realize ‘brown mall shooting suspect’ is not Hispanic after all.” Others suggested that officials and the media were trying to cover up the possibility of terrorism inspired by or sympathetic to ISIS.

Say what you want about Donald Trump, but he knows a thing or two about the power of social media. Case in point. On Monday, the Trump campaign unveiled its very own Snapchat filter ahead of the debate. It says “Debate Day” with “Donald J. Trump vs. Crooked Hillary” underneath:  Here’s the filter, featuring one of my bulldogs, Sophia:  Yeah. She’s kinda dopey today. Now, I know what you may be thinking. So what? Who even uses Snapchat? To which I say, “Everyone under the age of 28.” OK– that’s a rough estimate. But Snapchat is really hot with millennials. I even find myself going on frequently to check out the new filters. It’s pointless fun. Needless to say, Hillary supporters are super mad at Snapchat. Wow crooked Hillary? Good to know you have no standards/morals whatsoever @Snapchat. Didn’t know you needed money that bad. pic.twitter.com/UwuOnKY5E3 — Bailey Bonet (@BaileyBonet) September 26, 2016  How could @Snapchat let this happen? 😡 https://t.co/WlbZGHiUdz #ImWithHer — Hannah Sleznikow (@HSleznikow) September 26, 2016  Trumps Snapchat filter remembered to put “Crooked Hillary” but somehow forgot to replace “Donald J. Trump” with “Racist Misogynist Bigot” — Meg Walsh☪ (@MegWalshh) September 26, 2016  Trump had a snapchat geofilter made that says “crooked Hillary” on it lol. He has to be the biggest child that ever ran for president. — Stephen (@StephenOssola) September 26, 2016  Appalled Snapchat would permit a Trump filter that says “Crooked Hillary.” Here’s what I think of that. #imwithher pic.twitter.com/lvAf6MNXSI — Rachel Sklar (@rachelsklar) September 26, 2016  Poor fragile flowers. As a reminder, this was Hillary’s attempt at appealing to millennials on social media. (I think this was originally a Vine.) Painful. Trump’s way better at this. As dumb as it may seem, that filter was money well spent.
A Kansas sheriffs deputy was murdered on Sunday by illegal immigrants that had been arrested on two occasions already. The perpetrator was Adrian Espinosa-Flores who is 38 years old. He was charged on Monday with the crime of involuntary manslaughter. Allegedly, he was driving drunk and crashed his truck into a patrol car that had been stopped on the side of the road. Unfortunately the crash led to the death of Johnson County Sheriff’s Department Master Deputy Brandon Collins who was 45 years of age at the time of the accident. The Kansas City Star reported in the investigation. They reported that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement had made an immigration detainer on the suspect Espinosa-Flores. Detainers are requests that people be transferred into the custody of ICE. They are specifically made for the purposes of immigration violations. An anonymous source with inside knowledge of the investigation tipped off the media that the detainer the suspect had was because of allegations he was in the country illegally. The Johnson County District Attorney’s Office refused to answer any questions saying that it is an ongoing investigation. The suspect was arrested for DUI in 2001 and in 2013 had a traffic violation however ICE noted they had not been notified of these previous arrests. 41 Action News reported, “it could be considered profiling because a lot of people of all races are arrested without a proper ID.” People laughed Donald Trump off and called him a xenophobe when he pointed out all the people in the United States murdered by illegal immigrants. Surely, they’re not laughing now. This very sad and tragic incident proves that Trump’s comments about violent illegal immigrants is far truer than anyone would like to admit. However, come November when he builds that wall this hopefully won’t be as great of an issue anymore.   
In yet another of the disturbing Islamophobic attacks occuring more and more frequently in the United States, a man in northern Philadelphia (Dauphin and Cleveland streets) is wanted for throwing a firebomb into an occupied car. The assailant allegedly screamed “there you go, Muslim!” as he hurled what is assumed to be an  improvised incendiary device into the vehicle. The victim was rushed to the hospital and is being treated for severe burns. The fearmongering rhetoric of Donald Trump and the far-right wing has lead to an appalling uptick in anti-Muslim attacks, the frequency of which increased by a staggering 87.5% after Republican nominee Donald Trump called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. Such heinous attacks only serve to divide us and make us less safe. It intensifies the perception that Muslims are not welcome in the United States, and it is precisely that kind of alienation that creates fertile ground for predatory radicals to work their pernicious evil. Jihadi propaganda relies on the central argument that Western “crusader” culture despises Muslims and that Islamic culture is incompatible with the West; these kind of attacks only prove their point. That’s why Donald Trump has been featured in recruitment videos from brutal jihadi groups like Daesh (ISIS/ISIL) and Somalia’s al-Shabaab. Former CIA director Michael Hayden explained that “When Mr. Trump says some of the things that he has said — ‘they all hate us,’ ‘we shouldn’t let any of those people in our country’ — what he does is underscore and underpin the fundamentals of [the ISIS] narrative of undying enmity. We don’t have radicalized communities in the United States. We have some radicalized individuals, but we have it fully within our ability to create radicalized communities, and that kind of rhetoric … actually bends you in the direction of radicalizing communities.” Unless we want the plague of terrorism to spread in the United States, we must be inclusionary and accepting, manifesting the values of tolerance and pluralism that our country was founded on. We cannot  allow the rabble-rousing ramblings of a bigot to put the lives of our citizens in danger. Police are still searching for a suspect. Here’s a video of the aftermath, courtesy of @FeministaJones: 
A well known Black Lives Matter activist called police for help when he was the victim of an armed robbery. Ironically, he is now called for a larger police presence in the form of intervention and protection in his neighborhood. The man is Jerry Ford Jr. whose a new graduate of the University of Houston. He has spent most of his time speaking out against police brutality. But he certainly wasn’t when he called for help.    A firearm ready criminal robbed him right outside of his apartment complex where he lives just a few blocks away from his college campus. Now he’s calling on the police and the university as well as other local authorities to increase the level of police in the area. Specifically, the area between the campus and the living complex. Many students from the school live there. Ford said he thought the robber was originally a student. Ford stated the man asked if he had a key and he responded that he did and then proceeded to open the door. When he turned around he was staring down the barrel of the gun the criminal was holding. He told the media, “I reach in right here to open the door, and I turn back around and he has the gun right there in my face.” The criminal is also a thief because he stole Ford’s cell phone and wallet. He demands now that police patrol the area since local and university police do not. The greatest part is that he claims he is not anti-police he is just anti-bad police. That’s a really good cop out when you need the help of the people you’ve been bashing for years. Ford also insists he isn’t just doing this for himself but also for the safety of everyone in his complex including other students. “It’s becoming a pattern. I hope they would take a bigger stance and put more security over here because you have a lot of people walking back and forth to class.” You’ve got to love the liberal logic behind that. 
Legendary journalist Dan Rather took to Facebook to give his two cents on tonight’s debate, and his response is a devastating indictment of Republican nominee Donald Trump’s atrocious behavior and obvious inability to stay within the realm of factual reality. Praising Clinton for maintaining her composure in the face of Trump’s aggressive interruptions, he tore into Trump for attempting to force our political atmosphere into a post-truth era and for repudiating the noble values of pluralism and tolerance that our nation was founded on. Ladies and gentlemen, whatever civility once existed in our politics is tonight officially dead. Never in the history of televised debates have we witnessed such a show. And that’s what the Donald wanted. A show. He got it, but will he be seen as the hero or the villain? If you are a fan of Hillary Clinton, I suspect you are thrilled with her poised and confident performance. Perhaps her crowning line was “I prepared for this debate and I’m prepared to be President”. If you are a fan of Donald Trump, his quarrelsome, no-holds-barred approach, often facts be damned, will likely in turn have thrilled you. The question is what does everybody else watching think and how many impressionable voters remain? Taking a snapshot of the debate stage this evening, two candidates behind podiums, each representing one of the major political parties, it would seem to be the latest chapter in our quadrennial dance with democracy. But experiencing the event, in sound and motion, it was of course anything but. From the very beginning, the body language tonight was striking. HIllary Clinton, the first woman ever to be on this stage was calm and substantive. Donald Trump interrupted often and slouched and sneered as he turned to address her. This is what Trump’s fans like about him, playing the alpha male at all costs. Clinton seemed completely unflustered, which is what her fans love about her. How this all plays to the majority of viewers and voters at home will be in the eyes of the beholder. But I was surprised by how much this man who has made so much of the means of television spent not looking into the camera, but preoccupied with his adversary. Trump came across as amped, a pacing tiger ready to pounce on every answer. His Interruptions suggests little regard to the rules. He’s itching for a fight…Wants to swing wildly. Clinton was clearly the policy expert, nimbly jumping from topic to topic, policy to policy. But she was also much more able to paint a big picture than I have seen in times past. I thought she was particularly effective on the issue of race and especially the birther lie against President Obama. She had the facts on her side, but also it was an effective appeal to fire up her base. In the end, more than all of the specifics, I was struck by how unprecedented was the overall tenor – matching that of the campaign. We once held certain truths to be “self-evident” – that “all men are created equal” and “they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” These were the lofty ideals that served as a rallying cry for the founders of these United States to choose liberty over tyranny. The man who wrote these words, Thomas Jefferson, and his compatriots were imperfect and in some cases deeply flawed men. Yet their idealism fixed a North Star in our democratic firmament that has guided our ship of state ever since, with some very noted moral detours. Now I fear that the tide of progress is rapidly receding with the fierce undertow of a looming tsunami. Our Founders believed in reason and the power of intellect. Donald Trump made clear tonight by his wilful ignorance of important issues that he does not. Our founders feared the accumulation of power, they loathed vanity, and tried to build in protections against the demagogues who would appeal to mankind’s basest instincts. Donald Trump relishes in all of these impulses. For him they are instinctual and a prescription for success. To call Trump a con man, as many have, is a disservice to the art of the con. By its definition a con requires deceit. But Trump has not tried to hide his lies or the sheer unrealistic audacity of his cartoonish policy positions. He has asked the American people to bet on him. The fact checkers will certainly weigh in. The pundits will have their say. But the voters have all the information they need. The judgement is in their – or more accurately our – hands. Rather’s words are poetic and nuanced, mixing biting severity with the civilizing admonitions that forged the American journalistic tradition – values that the modern media have abandoned in their ravenous scramble for ratings. We are lucky to have him as a guiding voice during this time of contempt and division. h/t to Dan Rather.
Stockton police are searching for the suspects in a vicious attack that happened on Friday against two teenaged sisters. It all happened at a Black Lives Matter vigil being held in Stockton, CA where a black man was fatally wounded by police for ignoring officer’s commands to drop his handgun. The teenage girls were not participating in the protest, but just passing by. They both believed they were attacked because they were white.   Police say two Caucasian girls left a local restaurant and passed by the protest when they were attacked by the protestors. What was supposed to be a peaceful protest remembering Colby Friday turned into a vicious brawl directed against two sisters, and now, investigators are looking for suspects. “Our understanding is that it involved several out-of-towners whose intent was more than protesting,” said Ron Freitas, the Assistant District Attorney for San Joaquin County. Stockton police say the protestors claimed to be connected with the Black Lives Matter movement and were protesting recent officer-involved shootings against blacks. WARNING to white people: Don’t let your curiosity put you in danger. Black Lives Matter protests are filled with thugs who think white people are the devil and are the reason for all their problems. It is really dumb to be anywhere near those ‘protests’ because so far police officers have been killed, reporters wounded, property trashed and looted, and the biggest target is a white person. So if you’re white, just stay away. This is the new America… thanks Obama for the ‘No Go Zones’.   
The San Francisco 49ers are now facing fallout from their decision not to cut backup quarterback Colin Kaepernick.  The Santa Clara police union has reportedly threatened to boycott 49ers games in response to quarterback Colin Kaepernick's refusal to stand during the national anthem and his comments on racial injustice and police brutality. Members of the union wrote a letter to the San Francisco 49ers, which was obtained by KNTV, warning that if the team does not take action against Kaepernick, "it could result in police officers choosing not to work at your facilities." The Santa Clara Police Department is the primary law enforcement agency at Levi's Stadium, where the 49ers play. About 70 officers choose work during games and are paid as security personnel. The union says about two-thirds of the officers who work at Levi's Stadium are from Santa Clara. Officers from other departments could be hired if Santa Clara officers decide not to show up, but Saunders says this could create a conflict with the city's contract with the union. Santa Clara Police Chief Michael Sellers urged his officers to avoid the boycott and to put the community's safety first. "The safety of our community is out highest priority," Sellers said in a statement, reports USA Today. "I will urge the POA leadership to put the safety of our citizens first. I will work with both sides to find a solution. In the meantime, I will ensure we continue to provide a safe environment at Levi's Stadium." Sellers said that he respects Kaepernick's right to free speech and that he would encourage all officers to respect the rights of all citizens, no matter whether or not they disagree with their opinions. Kaepernick made headlines after speaking out about police brutality and saying that officers "murder minorities." He was also photographed wearing socks depicting pigs in police uniforms. "The 49ers are allowing this to come out from an employee and it's making for a hostile work environment for us at the stadium," Saunders said.

HBO’s Real Time host Bill Maher – someone not often inclined to side with Donald Trump – said that Trump is right about profiling in the context of how to deal with terrorism. Here’s what he said: “He is for profiling, that’s what he said. But he said we should do it the way Israel does. And, like, every once in while Donald Trump says something right. Because we profile already, we just do it stupidly. All police work is profiling. Discrimination does not mean prejudice; discrimination means telling un-like things apart… “What they do is they hire really smart people. This is not the TSA, which is just guys giggling at your balls when they’re looking — a screener. If we would pay people $100,000 to do this job, we could get the kind of people who do it in Israel. “And, again, we’re just talking about a few questions. We’re not talking about the rubber hose or sending you to a black site. I mean, I don’t think this is too much of a sacrifice to ask.” He’s definitely right about the TSA. Their scanners and pat-down agents don’t do anything to prevent terrorism. Not only has the TSA caught zero terrorists and stopped zero terrorist attacks, they have a 95% failure rate. That means, that they’ll catch contraband roughly 5% of the time. The rest of the time, it gets through. It’s a wonder that we haven’t dealt with another 9/11-style attack over the past 15 years. How does an institution with such an abysmal track record even exist? (Dumb question, I know…it’s government, so of course, it’s going to be nothing but expensive and ineffective.)

As we watch police officers hunted down and assassinated, and we see riots rear up every time a black man is shot by police, we might want to take a moment to review the actual numbers behind these shootings. The number of lives lost by police using deadly force is minuscule. Since it is an act of last resort, it should be. Twice as many white suspects are killed in violent encounters with police, but you never hear about that. See the statistics below. If black lives mattered so much to the radicals out there, they would focus more on reducing crime and helping their communities. They don’t… the likes of Black Lives Matter, the New Black Panthers and the Nation of Islam riot, loot and kill, many times in their own neighborhoods. It’s the violence and chaos they want… not to rectify any injustice.  From Freedom Daily: 2013 U.S. population is 316,128,839 persons, here are annual percentages: ⦁ 0.012% of the U.S. population committed suicide ⦁ 0.011% of the U.S. population died in a vehicle crash ⦁ 0.004% of the U.S. population died in a criminal homicide ⦁ 0.00012% of the U.S. population died from police use of force ⦁ 0.00012% of the U.S. population was struck by lightning ⦁ 0.00009% of the U.S. population was legally killed by a private citizen in self-defense …that of the 1,491 persons that died from police use of force from 2009-2012: ⦁ 915 (61.4%) were white males ⦁ 481 (32.2%) were black males ⦁ 48 (3.2%) were males of other races ⦁ 28 (1.9%) were white females ⦁ 15 (1.1%) were black females ⦁ 4 (0.2%) were females of other races ⦁While only 6% of the U.S. population is identified as black and male, 57.9% of the persons legally killed by a private citizen in self-defense were black males. ⦁ However, 73.1% of the black males legally killed by a citizen in self-defense between 2009-2012 were killed by a black citizen. ⦁ 42.6% of victims of all solved criminal homicides from 2009-2012 were black males ⦁ 89.6% of black males killed in criminal homicides from 2009-2012 were killed by another black male ⦁ 40.6% of the police officers murdered in the line of duty from 2009-2012 were killed by black males* Police officers put their lives on the line each and every day they go out there to protect us. They never know if it will be their last. They have sworn an oath that all lives matter and they will protect people from those that are criminally inclined and evil. There are very few ‘bad’ cops and they are usually weeded out. The majority of officers are those who joined to help others and keep them from harm. You have about as much chance of being struck by lightning as you do being shot by a police officer. You really have to work at it to become a statistic. Those that are shot almost without fail are threatening police officers or not obeying commands. The statistics tell the story if anyone bothers to review them. Violence is out of control in the black community and overwhelmingly when a person is shot, it is justified. And it happens very rarely.    
CNN had an ominous headline today (it’s showing on google but they changed it on the story): Trump, Netanyahu meet for nearly 90 minutes. It’s like a BIG DEAL to CNN that Netanyaho met with Trump longer than Clinton saying that ‘Her meeting with the prime minister was somewhat shorter than his talk Sunday morning with Trump. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Hillary Clinton Sunday night at a New York hotel, after conferring earlier in the day with Donald Trump for nearly 90 minutes at Trump Tower’.   So why do you think Netanyahu met longer with Trump than Hillary? Well Hillary has been the Secretary of State during an unprecedented time where the United State’s devotion to Israel has waned dramatically. Under Hillary as Secretary of State, the U.S. has given over $100 billion to the terrorist regime in Iran whom Obama supports over Israel. This is what leaders look like.  The meetings between Netanyahu and Trump and Hillary materialized over 24 hours on Friday. Trump’s aid made a phone call to one of the prime minister’s advisers. Once it was clear that a meeting was going to happen, Netanyahu’s office contacted Clinton’s campaign to hold a meeting with her as well, to keep the balance. The Prime Minister’s senior official explained that, “The prime minister’s instruction was clear – if we meet with one side, we must also meet with the other side. We are following the number of meetings to make sure that one side doesn’t get more meetings than the other.” The Trump campaign statement said during the meeting, “Trump agreed that the military assistance provided to Israel and missile defense cooperation with Israel are an excellent investment for America,” amid the backdrop of speculation that Trump would support cutting U.S. military aid to Israel. Trump told Netanyahu that if elected, “there will be extraordinary strategic, technological, military and intelligence cooperation between the two countries.” Trump added that Israel is a “vital partner of the United States in the global war against radical Islamic terrorism.” The two also discussed the nuclear deal with Iran and the fight against ISIS. “Mr. Trump acknowledged that Jerusalem has been the eternal capital of the Jewish People for over 3000 years, and that the United States, under a Trump administration, will finally accept the long-standing Congressional mandate to recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of the State of Israel,” the statement read. “Mr. Trump recognized that Israel and its citizens have suffered far too long on the front lines of Islamic terrorism,” according to the statement. “He agreed with Prime Minister Netanyahu that the Israeli people want a just and lasting peace with their neighbors, but that peace will only come when the Palestinians renounce hatred and violence and accept Israel as a Jewish State.” Does Hillary have anything to worry about since she has hardly been able to retain a stable relationship between the US and Israel and now Trump is asking for private audiences reaffirming traditional promises the US has had with Israel since before the Obama Presidency? When it comes to looking Presidential, Trump is really kicking Hillary’s butt.    Readout Of Donald J.

Paul Combetta, is the tech guy who helped Hillary Clinton bleach her server clean of the evidence requested from federal authorities, seems to have gone to online forums to find advice on how to commit the evil deed. Last week Combetta pled the fifth when testifying before the house oversight committee last week, but wasn’t as tight-lipped when trying to find out information on how to strip Clinton’s e-mail address from already sent and archived emails from fellow IT experts on Reddit. In the end a fellow tech guy told him the only thing he could do is delete the emails The evidence was first posted at 8chan, it consisted of Reddit posts from two years ago.  The thread was titled  “Here is clear proof that Hillary sought to destroy evidence,”  Here is the guy who wiped Hillary’s server asking about how to do it on Reddit. Yes. Seriously. He also asks how to replace real emails with fake ones. His post happens right about the same time congress was requesting Clinton’s emails. He specifically said it was for a big name client who everybody would recognize. A Reddit post has been found from Paul Combetta (the IT guy who got FBI immunity and deleted Hillary’s emails) proving they were covering up for Hillary. First, notice Paul’s email address here: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Csrp9J6WEAAyubT.jpg [email protected] He uses the same username on his Etsy page: https://www.etsy.com/people/stonetear (Backup http://archive.is/P45cY ) Now look at the username of this Redditor asking how to strip the name of a “VERY VIP” from email archives… Read the rest of the story at Jeff Dunetz’s blog The Lid  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.
Matt Lauer is being skinned alive by the leftwingnut media for his honest presidential forum with Hillary and Trump. They are calling for his head on a platter for asking Hillary about her email crimes. The rightwing saw the interview as a surprise since leftists normally do their utmost to shield Hillary and avoid exposing her crimes. But then they saw that Lauer didn’t go into as much detail as they would have and that he did go after Trump, but not to the degree with which leftist fanatics would have and that has sent those leftwingnuts over the edge. In the coming debate between Trump and Hillary, they are calling on their moderators to “fact check” Trump, but not Hillary. The purpose of journalism is to inform you of events. You are then free to decide your opinion of those events. Opinions expressed in the media are supposed to be from either the public or the editors. But that is not what the leftist media practices today. Remember the 2nd Romney-Obama debate? The moderator took over debating Romney and backed Obama’s lie that he said the assassination of Ambassador Stevens was a terror attack. Even though she admitted she lied the next day the damage was done. I am not a journalist. I have a degree in journalism, but that doesn’t make me a journalist. I do not work for the media and I do not report the news. I am a blogger. I do not report events. I express my opinion of events. Before you read my articles I expect you to already know the ‘who, what, when, where, and how’ of events. If you are ignorant because you listen to the leftwingnut media spin then you will probably think my opinion is wrong because you think my facts are lies. There are leftwingnuts who have chastised bloggers as false because we express our opinions, as if by doing so that makes what we say not the truth. Expressing your opinion of an event does not make the facts of that event a lie – except in the narrow minds of ignorant liberals. I have also been chastised that I do not make good arguments because I am not… Read the rest of the story at www.iPatriot.com  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.
Terence Crutcher, 40, was shot once and killed by Tulsa police officer Betty Shelby at around 7:40 p.m. Friday. Before the fatal shooting, police received reports of an abandoned vehicle blocking a road. On Monday, the police department released aerial video of the incident. Shelby’s husband and an unidentified pilot are heard telling each other than they believe the “black dude” was dangerous and “needed to be tasered.” It was later discovered that Mr. Crutcher was unarmed. He wasn’t a danger and his arms were in the air when he was shot dead by Officer Shelby. Crutcher’s vehicle had stalled in the street and was seeking assistance. The Associated Press reports: Prosecutors in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have filed first-degree manslaughter charges against the white police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black man on a city street. District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler filed the charges Thursday against officer Betty Shelby, who shot and killed 40-year-old Terence Crutcher on Sept. 16. Dashcam and aerial footage of the shooting and its aftermath showed Crutcher walking away from Shelby with his arms in the air. Shelby had a stun gun on her at the time but chose not to use it and instead, opted for deadly force. BREAKING: Prosecutor announces 1st-degree manslaughter charges against Tulsa officer who fatally shot Terence Crutcher. — The Associated Press (@AP) September 22, 2016  Officer Shelby has quite a history. When applying for a job with the sheriff’s office, she described previous marijuana use. In addition, she admitted to two previous domestic-related incidents involving the courts. She told of a 1993 incident in which she and her boyfriend at the time damaged each other’s vehicles when they were breaking up. Both filed temporary restraining orders that were subsequently dismissed. And then there’s a 2002 incident in which she said her ex-husband’s new wife filed a protective order which claimed that Shelby made harassing phone calls to her. Later, the protective order was later denied, according to what Shelby said in her application. “The Judge saw that I was not guilty of the accusations made against me,” she stated at the time. On Monday, the department said that Shelby is on paid administrative leave. That’s the protocol for a shooting at the hands of a police officer. And today, she faces first-degree manslaughter charges. Video of the incident: If the police shooting of Terence Crutcher is acceptable to you, then you need to reevaluate your life.
The problems surrounding the Clinton Foundation continue to worsen. We know that over half of Hillary Clinton’s meetings during her tenure as secretary of state (85 of 154 people) were with individuals who either donated to her slush fund or pledged to support one of its international programs. We know the Clinton Foundation accepted donations from sketchy foreign entities. We know half of the staffers paid under the GSA program also worked for the Clinton Foundation. We know Hillary’s former chief of staff at the State Department, Cheryl Mills, also worked for the Clinton Foundation while working for the State. We know the Clinton Foundation spent 10 percent of its budget on charitable grants in 2013.  The Clinton Foundation claims that “88% of our expenditures go directly to our life-changing work,” but one has to wonder. How does spending $8.5 million (or 10% of the budget) on travel– plane tickets, hotel accommodations, etc.– change lives? Heck, $4.8 million (or 5.6 percent) of the 2013 budget went toward office supplies. Dead serious. Blank paper and staplers are pricey, I guess. Call it “overhead” all you want, but it’s absurd. Just take a deeper look. If you didn’t think it could get any worse, I’m sorry. You’re wrong. In 2014, only 5.7% of the Clinton Foundation’s budget went to charitable grants. Everything else covered staff salaries, travel and other benefits. The organization’s IRS filings revealed that it spend just short of  $91.3 million in 2014. Of that, $5.2 million went to charity. Around $34.8 million went toward staff salaries and benefits, and $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses.” Oh. And $851,000 was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Fundraising can be expensive. Hillary knows all about that. Basically, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013 but somehow managed to increase employee compensation and “other expenses” by $5 million each. The Clintons are super charitable though. They donated over $1 million to charity last year! Who cares if $1 million went to their personal slush fund? They are so compassionate. Just kidding. Vice President Joe Biden can’t even get himself to say that the Clinton Foundation is ethical. h/t Daily Caller

Three of the Baltimore police officers previously charged in the death of Freddie Gray were recently treated like war heroes at a right-wing media gala. Deneen Borelli, a regular contributor to Fox News, gave a speech at the Media Research Center’s annual black tie gala lauding the officers Garrett Miller, Edward Nero, and Brian Rice in front of panelists like Rush Limbaugh, Monica Crowley, and Cal Thomas. 25-year-old Freddie Gray’s death — which was ruled as a homicide — was only mentioned once, as an afterthought. According to the New York Daily News, Borelli blamed the Baltimore riots not on the six officers charged in Freddie Gray’s death, but on “the left, political agitators, and the national media” who were out to “advance the anti-police narrative.” “These five men and one woman, all veteran police officers, were now in handcuffs, fighting for their lives, their careers destroyed, bankrupted, humiliated,” Borelli said. ““No one thanked them for their service or recognized their honor. Who will thank these officers? Who will thank all police officers…at a time they are being so vilified? Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, we will.” Officer Garett Miller, who remains under administrative duty pending an internal affairs investigation into Gray’s death, complained that the police officer profession was “hurting,” and asked for “prayers.” “We’re losing officers at an incredible rate. Not just from gunfire but because they’re tired of it. They quit. Our department is short. Everywhere is short. Nobody wants to be a police officer anymore,” Miller said. As the Baltimore Sun reported, Gray suffered a fatal injury to his spine after taking a blow to the lower-left side of his head while being transported in a Baltimore police van. Officers restrained Gray’s hands and ankles, and didn’t belt him in before transporting him, which is a violation of Baltimore Police Department policy. “The assisting officer opened the doors and observed Mr. Gray lying belly down on the floor with his head facing the cabin compartment, and reportedly he was asking for help, saying he couldn’t breathe, couldn’t get up, and needed a medic,” the autopsy report read. All six officers charged in Freddie Gray’s death were ultimately cleared of all charges earlier this year.          
A Louisiana deputy city marshal is in hot water after body cam footage revealed him shooting at a suspect who had his hands up in the air. This is, sadly, becoming too common a story in the news as awareness of problems with officers who have hair-trigger fingers grows. What makes this story sadly and horrifically unique, though, is that Deputy Derrick Stafford also shot and killed the suspect’s six-year old son. And Stafford is claiming self-defense for that, because of course he is: “Stafford, out of fear for his life and that of his fellow officers, began shooting at the vehicle to prevent any further actions by [Christopher] Few which would put the officers in imminent danger.” Officers went after Christopher Few after watching an argument between him and his girlfriend outside a bar just before the 2015 shooting. They claimed witnessing domestic abuse as the reason they decided to chase down Few, whose six-year old son, Jeremy, was in the front passenger seat. 18 rounds were fired although Few had his hands up, but no firearm was found in the car, and Few and Jeremy were both shot while still in the car. Stafford and his partner, Norris Greenhouse, said that after Few drove forward and then backed up, they were in fear for their lives, so they fired. That’s always the story, though. It makes us wonder just what police departments are teaching that so many officers shoot first and ask questions later, claiming they were in fear for their lives when it’s obvious that their suspects were unarmed, and even had their hands in the air. Reports claim that neither Stafford nor Greenhouse knew Jeremy was in the car when they opened fire. Few was critically wounded, and Jeremy, who was autistic, non-verbal and in a special-needs first-grade class, was murdered. Stafford’s plea of “self-defense” is a huge middle finger to Few and the rest of Jeremy’s grieving family. Arguments will be heard in court next week, where Judge William Bennett will decide whether the indictments stand. 
Sheriff David Clarke is always right on the money when it comes to common sense policing and self protection. And he has something to say about the most recent round of shootings. We can all learn from his common sense advice. Let’s keep ourselves safe.   
The FBI just released its second batch of documents Friday, including notes from their various interviews with State Department officials, such as Hillary’s closest aides Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills. According to these newly-released documents, President Obama used a pseudonym when communicating by email with Hillary Clinton when she was Secretary of State. From Politico: In an April 5, 2016 interview with the FBI, Abedin was shown an email exchange between Clinton and Obama, but the longtime Clinton aide did not recognize the name of the sender. “Once informed that the sender’s name is believed to be pseudonym used by the president, Abedin exclaimed: ‘How is this not classified?'” the report says. “Abedin then expressed her amazement at the president’s use of a pseudonym and asked if she could have a copy of the email.” The State Department has refused to make public that and other emails Clinton exchanged with Obama. Lawyers have cited the “presidential communications privilege,” a variation of executive privilege, in order to withhold the messages under the Freedom of Information Act. The State Department hasn’t released the contents of the emails between the President and Secretary of State. The one that was shown to Abedin had the subject heading ‘Re: Congratulations.’ It was dated June 28, 2012. Politico speculates that it could have been in reference to the Supreme Court ruling on a particular part of the Obamacare law. Interestingly, President Obama had told reporters a little over a year ago that he had no idea the former Secretary of State used a private email server for official matters (even though he had been emailing her private address under a pseudonym). He said he learned about it “the same time everybody else learned it through news reports.” What do you think Obama’s pseudonym was?    The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.
In case you have been living under a rock, we recently learned that Hillary Clinton is human through a series of reports about That One Time She Coughed and The Time She Got Pneumonia. Yes, somehow anytime Clinton gets the sniffles, the Right pounces on it, using anything and everything they can to push absolutely bonkers conspiracy theories about the former Secretary of Stateâs health (sheâs on her deathbed, donâtchaknow). During an interview with ACBâs Sarina Fazan Wednesday, the reporter asked Clinton perhaps one of the dumbest f*cking questions she has been asked regarding her health: if she would undergo âneurocognitive testsâ to appease inflated, only-existing-on-Trumpâs-side-of-the-aisle concerns about whether or not her presidency will be like a four-year-long edition of . HillaryÂ just laughed in her face. âIâm very sorry I got pneumonia, Iâm glad antibiotics took care of it, and thatâs behind us now,â the former Secretary of State said, somehow managing to avoid knocking the reporter for starting off by claiming 9/11 was âlast week.â Clinton explained that her health meets and exceeds the standards anyone else running for office has met, but Fazan was all âso, ummmm, you gonna take those tests?â âThereâs no need for that,â Clinton said firmly, surely wondering how the f*ck this woman got hired in the first place. âThe information is very clear.â  HillaryÂ wasnât the only person laughing at Fazan, who also beat the dead horse that is the email âscandal.â Twitter lit up with people mocking the reporter for having the gall to waste time during an exclusive interview badgering the 2016 Democratic nominee about her health: @hannahfc and you are reporting this nonsense as if it is legitimate. Is this why you became a journalist? @danmericaCNN @abcactionnews â (((David Galiel:-))) (@davidgaliel) September 22, 2016  @Women4Trump @hannahfc @dmartosko @abcactionnews her career needs to die a hideous death â Naked Punditry (@NakedPundit) September 22, 2016  @hannahfc @abcactionnews oh jesus christ â Chris (@hugetinymistake) September 22, 2016  @hannahfc @danmericaCNN @abcactionnews No wonder media has an even higher negative rating than Trump these days.

Enjoy it while it lasts â mattydean (@mattydean) September 22, 2016  As some pointed out to this simpleton, HillaryÂ released her medical records just after the 9/11 anniversary, which was more than a week ago. She was diagnosed with a âmild, non-contagious bacterial pneumonia,â was given antibiotics, and had to practically be tied down to keep her from rushing back out on the campaign trail because she has traditionally insisted on being f*cking Superwoman. Whatâs next? Gonna ask her about Benghazi? Maybe she knowsÂ where ObamaâsÂ  birth certificate is hidden. Could she have some inside information on a second gunman involved in the JFK assassination? 
Last night America finally got to see Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton together in the same room. And just as expected, there was some much pent up sparring. Once the evening had concluded, it was evident who won that debate, no questions asked: Hillary Clinton. No one should be surprised. While the media has been speculating that viewers would once again see a âTrump pivot,â the facts remain the same â what we saw on the debate stage was the same Trump we saw during the Republican primaries â a brash, condescending, loudmouthed bully who has no plans, only talking points. All the pundits know it. The polls know it. The people know it. Hillary Clinton won because she was prepared, she was eloquent, and she kept her cool. But not surprisingly, Trump and his band of surrogates didnât get the memo. They think they won. Because why not? Trump (and his people) say Lester Holt was unfair. They say the microphone was tampered with. They say Hillary Clinton was âtoo preparedâ so it was an unfair advantage. They say the media was too biased. Excuse after excuse, Trump refuses to take responsibility for his actions. he was unprepared, he was disrespectful, he couldnât elaborate, and he got personal. But enough about Trump and his candy-ass excuses. Letâs talk about why Hillary Clinton was clearly the winner. Look no further than her best zinger of the night: âI think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think thatâs a good thing.â Itâs been reported that Clinton immersed herself with the issues of our times, poring over research, conducting rehearsals, and doing her homework. Trump, on the other hand, was taking a casual, passive approach to the debates, and it showed. He couldnât elaborate, he didnât show decorum, and he didnât know how to respond to Clintonâs assertions â except with lies. The bar was set pretty low due to Trump. Clinton knew she had to somewhat get on his level, but stay true to who she really ishis debate ended up being something special. She was up against a loud, bombastic, unpredictable bully who says whatever he pleases. Luckily for her, she didnât take any of his lies personally. She fact checked him when Holt wouldnât. She smiled politely as he sunk into the abyss with his never ending rambles. She wasnât âtoo loudâ as the pundits like to call it, but she was forceful when need be. And, even though itâs a stupid assessment (but somehow matters), she smiled. One of the reasons people hate debates is because they find that the moderators donât do their jobs. They allow the candidates to walk all over them, they go over their allotted time, they interrupt each other. It gets annoying. Luckily, Trump was in stark contrast to Hillary Clinton. She listened to Holt when he told her that her time was up, and rarely interrupted Holt to attack Trump. While Trump interrupted Clinton 51 times, she interrupted Trump only 17 times. At the end, Clinton shook Holtâs hand, and Trump did not. While Trumpâs famous âCrooked Hillaryâ was front and center on Snapchat, the facts paint a different story. NPR, the non-partisan gold standard of whatâs left of journalism, did an in-depth fact check analysis and showed that, surprise, Trump lied way more than Clinton, while Clintonâs claims were mostly upheld as true. While Donald Trump painted America as third world, crime-riddled hellhole, Clinton offered us a hopeful, inspiring message of bringing back jobs, fixing broken race relations, and investigating in future generations. Her plan would create 10 million jobs â his would cut 3.5 million. She wants to curb gun violence against black youth by holding them and communities (yes, that includes police officers) accountable. Trump wants to implement the unconstitutional and ineffective Stop and Frisk. Surprisingly, the agreed on several issues, such as the No-Fly gun ban, opposition to the TPP, and a need to bring jobs back from overseas. But simply put, her way, not âTrumped up trickle down,â will get us there. This is why Clinton won. She was the stronger candidate, and she shined while everyone was hoping it would be the other way around.Â Trump devolved into his classic self as she increasingly got under his skin. No, it wasnât Holtâs fault. No, it wasnât the microphoneâs fault. No, it wasnât Hillaryâs fault. It was Trumpâs fault, plain and simple. Maybe heâll take preparation a little more seriously for next time. Or maybe not. it is Trump, after all. 
After months of quiet, mass shootings once again shake the nation. Around six a.m this morning, a “disgruntled lawyer” opened fire at a mall in Houston, Texas, injuring nine before he was killed by police officers. Shooter Nathan Desai was found to have had multiple weapons in his vehicle – all of them legal, as was his right to openly carry his weapons into a public space. As this man was not a Muslim, the media narrative is that Desai was apparently a “disgruntled” lawyer who was frustrated with his firm’s closing due to lack of customers. But this story gets even weirder. Law enforcement sources said that the shooter was wearing what appeared to be an antique German uniform with swastikas on it, and reports indicate that more Nazi paraphernalia was discovered in his apartment. Why Desai was wearing a Nazi uniform, where he got it, and any relation to white supremacy or neo-Nazi groups are still unclear at the moment. But his attempt to slaughter his countrymen was the 288th mass shooting in this country so far this year, according to watchdog group GunViolenceArchive.org. Texas’ absurdly lax weapons laws resulted once again in a man opening fire into innocents. There was no good guy with a gun to save the day; just an angry Nazi lawyer.
In case you thought today couldn’t get any more weirder, a Trump supporter was busted for selling Nazi and Confederate flags at the 161st Bloomsburg Fair in Pennsylvania. Visitor Chloe Winters was enjoying the fair when she encountered a white-haired old man selling the flags of fascism and slavery – along with the inevitable “Hillary For Prison” signs, and she was absolutely appalled. “I was absolutely shocked and appalled when I saw this Nazi flag hanging at the Bloomsburg Fair yesterday. This flag represents the brutal and horrific genocide of innocent people. It stands for the hatred and destruction of a religion I feel blessed to be a part of. It’s 2016 and the world is still full of SO MUCH hate. When is it going to end? I’m sad to say that I’ll never go to the Bloomsburg Fair again, but it looks like I’m not wanted there anyway” she wrote on Facebook. As if the man wasn’t deplorable enough already, it turns out that flag-vendor Lawrence Betsinger is also a registered sex-offender for his conviction of more than 20 counts of possessing child pornography, which he doesn’t seem to believe is a big deal. ““I didn’t do anything wrong. I downloaded some shit on the Internet” he told PhillyMag.com. Betsinger doesn’t seem to understand what the fuss over the flags are, either. “If you don’t want it, don’t look at it. I’m not making anybody buy it. I guess there’s no First Amendment at the Bloomsburg Fair. I can’t see where it would be some tragic thing just because somebody bitched and moaned about it.” Deplorable indeed.
Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson has never shied away from sharing his love for God and his fellow man. In fact, it is one of his life’s purposes to serve and help his ‘brothers and sisters’ in changing lives to be better. Helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life. On the field he as a Quarterback, Wilson is all about winning. Off the field, he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in God. For this reason, it is no surprise that when the NFL told Wilson to not speak about his faith…he learned he could still share his love for God and message of hope, by his actions. Words were not necessary. He has stated many times that in his life, God comes first, family and friends second, and football third. Dedication to what is most important to him, is his strength. “In terms of my faith, my faith is everything: God comes first, family and friends come second, and football comes third,” Wilson concluded. “I think when you keep it in that order, great things happen to you. You don’t stress out about much.” It’s a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message. We have far too many people in high places, who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in God to do good things in their life. Then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to… themselves. Or worse, forget where they came from and who brought them there. Luck? No such thing. Good men’s hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country. Especially now in Obama’s America. You might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions, but once in there…if you do not share in the example that Wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share… corruption can and will take root. So the NFL told him not to talk about his faith… Interesting how things seem so one sided right? Don’t talk about God, it hurts people’s feelings. But feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and it’s heroes. With this kind of garbage happening…the truth becomes that much more obvious. Words like ‘tolerance’ are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. When you have men like Wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep. Ask yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad? There is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening. …and Obama’s Americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth. 
Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt were one of Hollywood’s most high-profile couples. But apparently, that is all over now: Angelina Jolie has just filed for divorce. Jolie, 41, cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for splitting from her husband of just two years. Pitt and Jolie married in 2014, but their relationship controversially began while Pitt was still married to actress Jennifer Aniston, in 2004 while they were filming the movie Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Pitt and Aniston divorced in January of 2005 and just months later, Pitt and Jolie went public with their relationship with her adopted son Maddox. Jolie adopted another child, a girl from Ethiopia, and then announced that she was pregnant with Pitt’s child. The couple adopted another child in 2007 before giving birth to twins in 2008.   While Pitt and Jolie had been together since 2004, they didn’t get engaged until 2012. The pair reportedly were waiting to get married until LGBT couples could also get married. Reports say that Jolie was angry with Pitt’s parenting style. She allegedly felt that Pitt was not safe around their kids, was unhappy with his alleged marijuana use, and thought he has anger issues. It has also been reported that Jolie hired a private detective to spy on him while he was filming his latest movie in London, because she suspected that he was cheating on her. Those suspicions were allegedly confirmed by the detective. Jolie is also known for her humanitarian work and is a United Nations special envoy, recently appearing before the UN to speak on behalf of Syrian refugees. Pitt, meanwhile, was reportedly much more interested in being part of Hollywood, making movies and going to parties.   It has been reported that Jolie is requesting sole custody of the couple’s six children and is seeking to have Pitt be given visitation rights only. Attorney Laura Wasser is said to be representing Jolie in the divorce, who also represented actress Amber Heard in her divorce from Johnny Depp earlier this year.

It’s not game over yet Hillary! Congress is out to find the truth and in a letter on Sept 9, asked for Comey to release all information he had regarding Hillary’s email scandal that FBI went over as evidence. He did not comply. So now…Congress has subpoenaed him! The Washington Examiner reported: House Committee on Science, Space and Technology Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, subpoenaed FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday for documents and information related to the security of the private email account and server Hillary Clinton used when she led the State Department. Smith asked Comey for the documents in a Sept. 9 letter, but then issued the subpoena after Comey failed to comply with the request. “The committee continues to have questions about the structure and security of the email system used by former Secretary Clinton and whether she and her staff employed cybersecurity standards required by FISMA,” the statement from the committee read. Rep. Smith earlier requested more information about Hillary Clinton’s server activities, such as the interviews with the Platte River employees involved in setting up and maintaining the private server. Recently, Platte River Networks employee Paul Combetta, who reportedly used BleachBit to “wipe” Hillary’s server, plead the Fifth before Congress. The obfuscation from the U.S. government over the private email server of Hillary Clinton, whose communication practices while at the State Department undoubtedly put the nation’s security at risk, is an alarming thing. The executive branch is ideally meant to be aloof from election matters; but as we have seen with the IRS, EPA and other government agencies stocked with card-carrying Democrats, “everything is politics.” Does this mean that a Clinton indictment is still a possibility so close to election? Anything could happen. The ramifications of an indictment so close to election day would be huge for their party- with quite a blow back. They should have just told the truth a lot earlier…to save themselves the embarrassment, and the trouble. The irony of it being, many Democrats would have gladly traded in Hillary for Bernie or Biden. Only time will tell what’s going to happen. Here’s hoping that Hillary’s skeletons will bury her career all on their own. me Sep 21, 2016 at 1:25 pm HAHAHAHA, We can only pray that something good WILL come out of this for America’s SAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!Trump 2016!!!!!!
Please disable your Ad Blocker in order to interact with the site. A key skill for ANY public speaker is the ability to handle a hostile audience. Hillary – sadly – does not appear to have learned this skill. Watch as she waits for the audience to come to her rescue:  She’s not very good at this at all. She missed a really good chance at a humanizing laugh line. Imagine the crowd response if she’d told the heckler to direct his comment to Bill? Too late. The moment is gone. Share if you think Hillary’s unfit to be President in EVERY possible way. 
The story of last Saturday’s Minnesota mall stabbing attack was the result of a lack of integration from Muslim immigrants. The suspect was 22 year old college student Dahir Adan, who is a Somali-American. He stabbed nine people before being shot dead by a former police chief and concealed carry permit holder. As we should’ve expected, it took a good guy with a gun to end the situation. Hilarious (or pathetically?) it took the media a few days to identify this as an Islamist attack, despite the fact that the attacker was literally shouting “Allah Akbar” as he was stabbing people. Did they think he misspoke and mean to be shouting “Praise Jesus!”? Yeah…. I don’t think so either. As it turns out, both Adan and the rest of his family were immigrants who made no attempt to assimilate into American culture whatsoever. As the Young Cons reported: Adan His father, Ahmed Adan, said, through a translator, that he had no indication that his son was a terrorist, according to the Tribune. The elder Adan said his son was a Somalian who was born in Kenya and came to America from his African home about 15 years ago. The Islamic State has since claimed responsibility for the attack and called Adan “a soldier of the Islamic State” who “carried out the operation in response to the citizens of countries belonging to the crusader coalition.” Adan’s father, with help of a translator, said he had no idea his son was a terrorist. He added that Dahir came to America 15 years ago after being born in Kenya. People had a lot to say about Middle Eastern and African refugees assimilating in America… @AnnCoulter Assimilation of immigrants, total BS, 15 yrs and can’t speak English, they want to change USA not be part of it, hate America — Dispicable JustKate (@JustKate038) September 19, 2016  Does it look like Somali refugees are assimilating to America’s tolerant values? @TuckerCarlson @foxandfriends https://t.co/HMWU1aSMlF — Adorable Deplorable (@OliMauritania) September 19, 2016  MN mall stabber’s family in US for 15 years. His father confirmed his identity “speaking…through an interpreter” https://t.co/wxHoMoC5FW — Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) September 18, 2016  In Europe, particularly those countries that have taken in massive amounts of Muslim migrants, particularly France Belgium, and the Netherlands, there have definitely been problems assimilating Muslim immigrants. If you poll American Muslims, you’ll find that the vast majority describe themselves as “Muslim first,” instead of “American first.” And when Trump says he’d deport all Muslims who express support for Sharia Law, there are liberals who have a problem with that! Think about that for a second… 
When reading an article like this, think of manmade global warming… From the Daily Caller News Foundation: Government funding of scientific research has a corrupting influence that could cause more unethical behavior among researchers, according to a new study by scientists at Virginia Tech. Researchers found federal funding is encouraging scientists to falsify data and publish bad research. The study found that universities are making the problem worse by mostly hiring young scientists as adjuncts, not tenure-track positions, which increases the financial pressures causing them to distort science. “Over the last 50 years, we argue that incentives for academic scientists have become increasingly perverse in terms of competition for research funding, development of quantitative metrics to measure performance, and a changing business model for higher education itself,” Marc Edwards and Siddhartha Roy, researchers at Virginia Tech, wrote in their study. Edwards was the scientist who helped expose that the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) top Midwest official knew about the Flint, Michigan drinking water crisis months before telling the public. “Furthermore, decreased discretionary funding at the federal and state level is creating a hypercompetitive environment between government agencies (e.g., EPA, NIH, CDC), for scientists in these agencies, and for academics seeking funding from all sources—the combination of perverse incentives and decreased funding increases pressures that can lead to unethical behavior,” they wrote. Government funding of research produces enormous financial incentives for scientists to engage in dubious laboratory research. Academics are under serious financial pressure to rapidly and continually publish research to sustain or further their careers, even if the research is essentially useless or misleading. Even major scientific journals like Nature are asking “Is Science Broken?” “The first problem are that the government provides monopoly funding for fields which are related to regulatory efforts, and much of that funding is spent with a foregone conclusion in mind,” Dr. Pat Michaels, the Director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute who was not involved in the study, told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “We don’t fund billions and billions of dollars of climate research each year to find that global warming isn’t a problem. Politics has intruded into the scientific process.” Due to this monopoly, scientists also have a huge incentive to tweak, or outright fake, statistical analyses to make results seem significant or to align with government priorities. A growing number of scientists have noticed the wave of retractions, especially among social scientists. Polling indicates that such consequences are causing science itself to become less trusted. “It also raises legitimate and disturbing questions as to whether accepting research funding from federal agencies is inherently unethical or not—modern agencies clearly have conflicts similar to those that are accepted and well understood for industry research sponsors,” Edwards and Roy continue in the study. “Given the mistaken presumption of research neutrality by federal funding agencies, the dangers of institutional research misconduct to society may outweigh those of industry-sponsored research.” A study found that 34 percent of researchers self-report that they have engaged in “questionable research practices,” including “dropping data points on a gut feeling” and “changing the design, methodology, and results of a study in response to pressures from a funding source,” whereas 72 percent of those surveyed knew of colleagues who had done so. Virginia Tech researchers note that the National Science Foundation estimates that research misconduct creates over $110 million in annual costs. “The second problem is that universities are biased towards federal funding, and will thus always be cheer-leading towards a dire view and treat people who don’t share that view very badly,” Dr. Michaels continued. “We’ve seen that repeatedly in climate science. There are enormous selective pressures to publish research that is dire and not publish research that is not. We’re creating biased canons of research because nobody will get a federal grant to study if global warming will have beneficial effects. The peer reviewers have a vested interest in making sure that the gravy train keeps rolling down the track.” In addition to outright fraud, these incentives lead to researchers not even bothering to write up negative results, as scientific journals tend to only publish the flashiest and most popular research. This biases the scientific canon and leads to duplication of research. Only seemingly groundbreaking research can lead to government grant money, scientific prizes, and potential tenure track jobs. “The entire American model of getting published, getting funded, then getting promoted means that people aren’t publishing negative results,” Michaels told TheDCNF. They’re only publishing flashy research. Getting published in Science, Nature or Cell is a ticket to future funding, promotion and tenure. This is giving young scientists an incentive to go into flashy fields that might get them on television, not important ones. This has created systematic problems in science.” As a result of these problems, researchers have a documented tendency to find evidence of phenomenons they happen to believe in and to reject observations that are unpopular with federal funders. In a survey of two thousand research psychologists conducted in 2011, over half admitted they selectively reported experiments, which gave the result they were after.

The bombings in New York City and New Jersey had everyone thinking one thing: terrorism. Officials didn’t want to jump to conclusions though and refused to link the attacks to a specific motive without having proof first. Well, they have their proof now. The FBI has detained five people, they’ve gathered more evidence and it is almost certainly Islamic terrorism. The five men the FBI detained are all from Afghanistan. And there’s one more person free, who authorities are trying to find. His name? Ahmad Khan Rahami.  WATCH: The moment @SteveDoocy's phone received the EMERGENCY ALERT regarding AHMAD KHAN RAHAMI live on air pic.twitter.com/qmFY1XoEta — FOX & Friends (@foxandfriends) September 19, 2016   Officials currently believe that the five men they apprehended were on their way to the airport. A total of five bombs were eventually found, bombs that were homemade, yet still sophisticated enough that the makers would need to do some research and have a decent amount of knowledge regarding bombs. There was also a letter written in Arabic found inside a plastic bag — the same plastic bag in fact that held the bomb itself.   Yet liberals were attacking Trump for describing the attack as a bombing. We’ve seen this kind of dishonesty from the liberal media before. Remember the Orlando nightclub shooting? That was another instance of Islamic terrorism, yet liberals turned it into an issue of gun control and homophobia, despite the fact that the shooter was a Muslim radical. There’s no way that we can effectively fight Islamic terrorism if we can’t even acknowledge what it is. Donald Trump, for all his faults, is at the very least willing to call a spade a spade. If we allow liberals to put their agenda before national security, then it will be impossible to keep this country safe. 
Scene number one – Cairo, Egypt: I am packing my luggage. At last, I am fulfilling my dream. I am ready for a long journey to a developed country that respects science and scientists. I am ready to join the developed world. Scene number two – New York, America: I feel shaky. I am stepping on the American land for the first time. I am joyful.  I’m full of euphoria, and I am worried. It’s a new life. I’m looking for a happy future, but am still scared.  What if all of this is just a dream and is not really happening? Scene number three – Louisville, Kentucky: I am not dreaming – it’s really happening. I am in a class in America for the first time. I pinched myself to make sure I’m awake. Scene number four – a couple of weeks since my arrival: I’m having an awful nightmare. I’m walking out of the classroom to find all of the faculty, the staff, and the students standing in a line. At the front of the line, there is a small TV in the Secretary’s office. A major terrorist attack has occurred. I wish it’s not true, and that it’s just a bad dream. I am hoping to wake up. However, It was true, I was awake, it was really happening. Scene number five – I take my spot in the line waiting and my heart is racing: What if they were Muslims? Please God, don’t let them be Muslims. The news came, the truth was hard. They were Muslims and worse, the leader is Egyptian. I am speechless. I covered my face with my hands from the shame and I tried to walk away. An American professor tapped on my back with sympathy.  An older American student whispered in my ear: “Take care of yourself. Some people might hurt you in blind retaliation.” I didn’t have a car then, and an American girl who I hardly knew offered to drive me home. I came here to study and work in a developed country. Later, I realized that the biggest gain is living among civilized people. Scene number six – many weeks later, I am in the airport: I am being harassed in the airports by the security every time I try to fly. Every time, I am picked randomly for a body search. This time, after every kind of search was performed on me and I was about to step in the airplane with my carry-on bag, a security person told me: ”Sir, you can’t have this bag with you on the airplane.”  I screamed: ”I have the right to have a carry-on item!”  He repeated in a begging tone: “Please sir, you can’t have this bag with you.” The worries and the fear in his eyes quelled my anger. I gave him the bag. I murmured: “What is some harassment? It’s a very small sacrifice compared to what was paid by those who lost their lives defending this country.”  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.
Brad Paisley doesn’t seem like one who would call out any other dude, but apparently he is! Brad Paisley is one of our favorite country artists, and he has more American pride than almost any other country artist. Although we were surprised at his latest statement, we kind of weren’t surprised at the same time. If you have any kind of social media, or you read the news anywhere you have probably heard about a man by the name of Colin Kaepernick. He is the San Fransisco 49ers quarterback and he refused to stand up during the National Anthem.  Of course, this caused a lot of controversy all over the U.S considering the fact that football is America’s sport. Kaepernick stated his reasoning behind sitting during the National Anthem and it only made American’s more mad…well most of them at least. “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color…To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”  In response to his comment his team made a statement saying that it is an individuals choice to choose wether they stand for the anthem or not. “The national anthem is and always will be a special part of the pre-game ceremony. It is an opportunity to honor our country and reflect on the great liberties we are afforded as its citizens. In respecting such American principles as freedom of religion and freedom of expression, we recognize the right of an individual to choose and participate, or not, in our celebration of the national anthem.” This didn’t set well with Brad Paisley though, and he made sure that his fans knew he didn’t support Kaepernick’s decisions. The country star was recently performing at then PNC Music Pavilion in Charlotte and a video came up behind him that had fans rolling laughing.  Paisley was performing a fan favorite song “Celebrity” that talks about stars who let fame get to their heads. It’s a humorous song, but the best part was the video that was playing behind Paisley while he sand the song. The video was of making fun of celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Justin Bieber, and Donald Trump. The crowd was laughing hysterically but then a video of a cartoon Kaepernick was kneeling on the football field and other players were standing around him! The crowds tone changed quick and they turned their laughs into yelling and BOOING. Paisley didn’t say anything about Kaeapernick before showing the video, but apparently he is going to be showing it at all of his concerts!  What do you think about the video idea?
You know that kid who is always trying to fit in? But no matter what they do they just seem a little off. The way they walk swinging, their arms unnaturally. Or they’re out with their other 2 buddies and there are only 2 barstools at the bar, so they stand behind the other guys trying to stand just right to look cool. Or they try to tell a joke but don’t really get the punch line right? Sad dorks have a hard life. If there is one thing that everyone can do (even a dork) and not totally mess up is take a selfie, right? You get to make funny faces, wear goofy clothes or anything in a selfie is deemed acceptable. In this video you will see a bunch of Muslims (I assume extremists) sitting around some guns as if the guns were a campfire. They are chanting some sort of song and everyone seems to be having a good time until the weird dude in the group decides to capture the moment with a selfie to PROVE he has friends. Remember, this is easy, you can’t mess it up. UNLESS you forget that the phone you are using is also a phone detonator to the bombs in the middle of the room. WOOPS! BOOM*&%^#!!! Watch VIDEO below: 
Donald Trump constantly talks about how heâll âmake America great again.â Heâll bring jobs back, put America first, all that populist, nationalist jazz that put him in the position of being the Republican nominee in the first place. However, thereâs one thing Trump can do to help Americans get more jobs: he can actually make his own products in the United States of America. Well, since Trump wonât readily make his manufacturing practices available to the American public on his own campaign website, Hillary has given us a handy guide complete with images, on hers. She calls it âA Buyerâs Guide For Donald Trump.â While Donald Trump says thatÂ âitâs very hard to have apparel made in this country,â orÂ  âthey donât even make the stuff here. Itâs so hard to get.â Hillary proves him wrong right away. Here is a handy map of where Trump can get all of his things made, right here in America, courtesy of HillaryClinton.com:  Hillary then goes ahead to list the individual categories on this map, complete with lists of places that each kind of product can be made. For instance, hereâs all the places Trump can make ties:  Instead, he makes them in China. And that is justÂ example. Go to Hillaryâs website for a full list. In other words, Trumpâs rhetoric is just that: bluster and bombaste for the sake of excusing his anti-American business practices. If Trump wants to bring jobs back to America, he can start with his own companies. Thanks for the handy guide, Hillary! No doubt Trump will never read it. 
This is one that will have you proud that protectors and sheepdogs don’t give a hoot about the color of skin. A schoolyard fight was caught on camera again, but it goes down quite differently than what you would expect, based off the first couple seconds of the brutal recording. One part that will have you disgusted with the tactics used by two bullies and another part will reveal that racist hate groups like BlackLivesMatter and The New Black Panthers aren’t as influential as the liberal media would have you believe.  You are going to witness how the color of one’s skin doesn’t keep you segregated as these hate groups would have you think and believe. As the clip opens up, a white male student is seated at a bench on school property, playing with his phone, when all of the sudden, two black students swing on him from behind. The first punch lands square on the kid’s jaw and he’s left with the only option of curling up in a defensive position. The two bullies are throwing punches as fast as they can, hitting their victim anywhere they can connect. All seems lost for the victim at first…until two students, one male and one female, step in to even the odds and protect the defenseless boy. Oh, and guess what? They’re black.   Now, it shouldn’t be a surprise to the majority of Americans living today that these two good Samaritans would stick up for another white student. The color of one’s skin isn’t a measure of the heart and if you don’t believe that, you are either a progressive racist, or you are an elderly racist living out life in the past. That’s not American. These two sheepdogs didn’t give a crap about the color of skin. They saw a sheep being devoured by wolves and they came roaring in to protect him. These two are truly heroes. 
For decades, employers have been holding America hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we donât vote the way they want. Of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. Jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced. It hasnât been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that weâve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (Republican) loses. Four years ago, it was âPapaâ John Schnatter, who threatened to cut his employeesâ hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through. It did and he didnât. This year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesnât get his way. Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carlâs Jr. and Hardeeâs. Hereâs one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:  Judging by the commercials, like Donald Trump, Puzder likely cares little about political correctness. But thatâs not the reason he wants a Republican in office. He just doesnât want to pay people more, or at all. In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Puzder says that if a Democrat wins, either Democrat, he will fully automate his stores. Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa, Puzder wrote: âI want to try it,â CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. âWe could have a restaurant thatâs focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.â âWith government driving up the cost of labor, itâs driving down the number of jobs,â he says. âYouâre going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.â âThis is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,â says Puzder. âDoes it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?â Source: Yahoo Finance This threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. Heâs hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests. Puzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is. Puzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees donât see any of that. In fact, Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied. You can guarantee, though, that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same, Puzder will still be automating. Thatâs just the way he is: profits over people.
That’s right, Trump events are so coveted, that scalpers sell tickets. And for $200! Check out this ad on Craigslist. NBC reported the story, Thousands of people with tickets to Donald Trump’s rally on Monday may not get into the event. German Arena will only allow about 8,000 people inside, and rally organizers are scrambling to find a larger venue. Lee County confirmed Friday that no permit application has been filed for any other venue. Ticket holders say it may be too late to find a bigger space. “I am going to be pissed if I can’t get in,” said Babs Littleton. She wants to see what Trump has to say, so she got a ticket to him. “People who agree with him, people who don’t agree with him, everyone is excited to go. He has definitely created excitement.” Sure, Hillary Clinton can win Florida. I’m not sure what the latest polls are. Regardless, if Trump continues to get people out to his events by the thousands, he will leave Hillary Clinton in the dust. And where are all the protesters that were appearing at all the Trump events? Did the Left run out of our money to pay them? The report continues, Ticket registration closed Friday afternoon. While the number of tickets distributed hasn’t been disclosed, the event is expected to attract between 9,000 and 15,000 people. “We need a bigger venue!” said nobody ever to the Clinton campaign. Yet this is not uncharted water for Trump. Trump’s camp has overbooked before. In January, officials in Vermont warned of safety concerns when Trump organizers distributed about 20,000 free tickets for a venue that only seated 1,400. With those numbers, no wonders scalpers sell tickets to Trump rallies. Vermont is Hillary Clinton lapdog and sellout Bernie Sanders’ state. The Democrat spin will be, “So what people come by the thousands to see speeches.” Right, because it’s the dead voters who really matter.   
I’ve pretty much decided to boycott the NFL. There are some great players and coaches there, but until Commissioner Goodell gets his head out of his butt and puts a stop to dissing the National Anthem, the military and the police, I want nothing to do with them. If you love your country, I would hope you love it more than the NFL and football or any other sport… what these whining, wealthy athletes are doing is not only unpatriotic, it is racist and incendiary in nature. They are spoiling for a race war. Three Philadelphia Eagles players raised their fists in the sign for Black Power at their game in Chicago on Monday night during the National Anthem. It was disgraceful and I think I’ve had just about enough of this crap. Ever since Colin Kaepernick started this cop-hating gesture by sitting and then kneeling during the National Anthem, it has had me furious. I’ve seen it spread to colleges and high schools. I’ve seen it infect other sports as well. It should not be tolerated by these teams… it’s just that simple. It doesn’t help that Barack and Michelle Obama have done it as well… it is a radical, racist gesture and unacceptable. I accept it no more than I would accept a Nazi salute – they are both disgusting and hateful. Even Sports Illustrated has bowed to Black Lives Matter. From Gateway Pundit: It’s an Obama world. Last week NFL players were sitting during the National Anthem. Now they’re raising the Black Power fist. On Monday four Eagles players raised the black power fist during the National Anthem.   Malcolm Jenkins and few teammates with fists in air during National Anthem. #Eagles pic.twitter.com/lLW8ZoYUUn — John Clark CSN (@JClarkCSN) September 20, 2016    Eagles defensive end Steven Means, strong safety Malcolm Jenkins and defensive back Ron Brooks all raised their fists. The rest of the Eagles, and all players on the Bears, stood at attention. The players who did the radical salute should all be shunned for this behavior and they should be ashamed of themselves. Especially since just days ago a black man ambushed a female police officer in her patrol car in Philadelphia, shooting her eight times. Her vest saved her, but the guy shot five others, killing one, before he was brought down. Doing the Black Power salute only makes all of that worse and inflames racial and police tensions even more. These players live in the freest country in the world, where they have made millions and live privileged lifestyles. Yet they hate America, her military and the police who protect their sorry asses. Obama took a colorblind society and turned it into a race war waiting to happen. Now, everything is about race and you have Black Lives Matter, the New Black Panthers and the Nation of Islam getting away with racial incitement and violence threatened and realized. These players deserve far more than a boycott. They deserve to be banned from their sports over this. There should be consequences for stoking the fires of racial animosity and the hatred of American heroes.  
The only convincing reason I can see for raising taxes is that it’ll mean less money in the pockets of George Soros. While liberals bemoan money in politics, it’s often those liberals funded by the likes of Soros doing the complaining. As of 2016, his net worth is nearly $25 billion. The right-wing Koch Brothers (worth 42.5 billion apiece) are wealthier, but Soros “invests” much more in politics than Soros does. Soros started the Open Society Institute in 1993 as a way to redistribute his wealth to progressive causes.  Using Open Society as a conduit, Soros has given more than $10 billion to a who’s who of left-wing groups. Imagine how many hungry people worldwide that much money could’ve saved, but instead he put that money towards organizations bent on destroying our civil society. This partial list of recipients of Soros’ money says it all: ACORN, Apollo Alliance, National Council of La Raza, Tides Foundation, Huffington Post, Southern Poverty Law Center, Soujourners, People for the American Way, Planned Parenthood, and the National Organization for Women. On the bright side, at least it’s his money he’s wasting going towards these causes, not federal money. At eighty-six years of age, the man is nearing the end of his life, and throwing money to whoever will take it at this point. He’s heavily backed Black Lives Matter, and now, is putting his money where his mouth is on the refugee issue. As Weasel Zippers reports: Billionaire George Soros said in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal that he would invest $500 million to meet the needs of migrants. The White House announced the commitment from Soros and around 50 other companies ahead of Obama convening a refugee summit Tuesday afternoon. Soros also said that he plans to work more closely with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Rescue Committee to assist in his investments. ‘In response, I have decided to earmark $500 million for investments that specifically address the needs of migrants, refugees and host communities. I will invest in startups, established companies, social-impact initiatives and businesses founded by migrants and refugees themselves. Although my main concern is to help migrants and refugees arriving in Europe, I will be looking for good investment ideas that will benefit migrants all over the world.’ ‘Governments must play the leading role in addressing this crisis by creating and sustaining adequate physical and social infrastructure for migrants and refugees.’ The lifetime cost of admitting only the 10,000 refugees we admitted in America comes out to a large $6.5 billion. George Soros isn’t going to be getting much bang for his buck (especially when its ten times cheaper to resettle refugees in the Middle East than in America and Europe) but if he wants to waste his money, I’m all for that. I’d rather him not have it anyway. 
Even though America’s focus at this time is either on NFL, or the race between two of the worst candidates in US history, the refugee problem all across the world still rages on and no more so than Europe. Over the last two years, the violent crimes perpetrated by Muslim refugees have shot through the roof. New Years of this year, Cologne, Germany faced several reports of gang rapes by Muslim men. Not only In Germany, but also in Sweden and many other European countries. The reports of violence in these host nations have been too much to bear for many of these countries and now one in particular is growing a pair and demanding it gain control of the situation.  Hungary’s controversial prime minister has called for the EU to gather up the refugees and send them off to northern Africa, or an island north of that, as they would be more accustomed to that particular culture. Viktor Orban, the Prime Minister suggested they should be ’rounded up and shipped out’ to ‘an island or some shore of North Africa’ where they can make their asylum applications. Many claim that Orban and his country whose government has been criticized by all sorts of self-righteous ‘rights’ groups for stirring up xenophobia and intolerance…isn’t that just dandy. If you want control over who comes across your borders, you are a xenophobe. To hell with sovereignty. They are basically saying ‘we control you. Go against our demands and face our wrath. We own you. Slave.’ This country has already put up barbed wire fences and they are catching flak for that too. Listen world… You all have your own countries, so mind your own damn business. If you are so disgusted about this Hungary thing, then you take them into your country. What kills me is all Hungary is asking for is that they do their asylum application BEFORE they are allowed into the country. ‘Those who came illegally must be rounded up and shipped out. We must set up large refugee camps outside the EU, with armed security and financial support provided by the Union. Everyone who came illegally must return there. There they can file for asylum.’ Did you catch that word, you progressive socialists? He said ‘ILLEGALLY’. Rules and laws are there for ALL to follow. Law and order.   
If you are an Eagles fan, I would certainly hope that you put your country and freedom before racism. Me personally, I’d boycott them and I’m this close to boycotting the entire NFL even though there are some good guys in it. Four Philadelphia Eagles players raised the Black Power fist at their game during the National Anthem. I’ve had it with this crap. I’ve seen other players do this as well. Hell, I’ve seen the Obamas do it too. It is totally unacceptable… it is a radical, racist gesture and should not be tolerated. No more than a Nazi salute would be tolerated. Did you know that Sports Illustrated just went all-in with the Black Lives Matter inspired anti-cop/anti-white NFL black protests, allocating the back-page essay to Jacksonville Jaguars player Jared Odrick? Yep, cross them off as well.  From Gateway Pundit: It’s an Obama world. Last week NFL players were sitting during the National Anthem. Now they’re raising the Black Power fist. On Monday four Eagles players raised the black power fist during the National Anthem.

The only thing that saved her was her bullet proof vest. He went on to shoot a security guard and then take a human shield. He shot that woman in the leg as well. Then he dumped 14 rounds into a car with two people in it. He killed the woman and critically wounded the man. Then he shot another officer who obligingly sent him straight to hell where he belongs. Then these football players pushed racial hate at an Eagles game in essence celebrating that. These are wealthy anti-American bigots and I think the fans have had just about enough of this. We love America, our military and our police. This nation was well on her way to being colorblind until Obama took over. Now, we are at each other’s throats and a race war is looming. These whiny rich football players, who have been free to play their sport and get wealthy off it, hate the country and the fans who empowered them to live a privileged life. I say revoke the privilege over this. No game is worth condoning racism and hatred this way.

The Senate on Tuesday failed to pass a short-term spending bill to keep the government funded as Mitch McConnell and other Republicans insisted on keeping corporate political funding hidden from voters and denying aid to the beleaguered residents of Flint, MI. Senators have been working in recent days on hammering out a short-term funding bill known as a continuing resolution that would fund the government until December 9 at the least. Absent such an agreement, the federal government will run out of money and shut down in three days on October 1. The intransigence of Senate Republicans on the issues of corporate financing and aid to Flint, however, have prevented the bill from passing as the Senate shot down a GOP continuing resolution today by a 55-45 vote. The first sticking point is a rider that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has insisted on adding to the bill and which would block the Securities and Exchange Committee (SEC) from requiring publicly-traded corporations to disclose their political spending. Ever since the Citizens United decision of 2010, corporate donors have been able to make unlimited political donations without disclosing any information on their political spending to the public. This has led to an unprecedented influx of corporate and big donor money in American elections – close to $700 million so far this year – and has served Republicans and their big-money donors quite well. So well, in fact, that Senate Republicans are willing to sacrifice the functioning of the government itself just to be able to keep the nefarious sources of their campaign financing secret and please the oligarchs who pull their strings. Clashes have also arisen over Republican refusal to include in the bill aid to the city of Flint, MI, which is still suffering from the effects of a neoconservative-engineered lead poisoning crisis. The bill already includes flood aid for flood victims in Maryland, West Virginia, and Louisiana, and Democrats have requested that aid for the victims of the water crisis in Flint be included as well. Republicans, however, have refused to add this money, and have come up with a variety of facetious justifications for their indifference to the sufferings of poor African-Americans, from claiming that the Flint crisis is a local issue to deciding that the Flint aid should be included in the separate Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) instead. The problem with that excuse is that Democrats have already tried to pass the Flint aid through WRDA but came up against the same wall of Republican intransigence and indifference there. The Senate successfully passed a version of the WRDA earlier this year that included more than $220 million in aid and infrastructure improvements for Flint. Paul Ryan and his band of extremist Republicans in the House, however, stripped the Flint aid provision from the House version of the WRDA, and the discrepancy between the bills would have to be settled in conference committee negotiations after the November election, and the dominance of hardline Republicans in the House makes it very unlikely that such a settlement would include aid to Flint. So, once again, Republicans, for whom compromise and good governance seem to be alien concepts, are sending the federal government hurtling down the path to shutdown for absolutely no good reason. The issues underlying this most recent case of intransigence, however, demonstrate more clearly than ever the degree to which many Republicans have ceased to serve the people they are elected to protect and instead devote all of their efforts to aiding their corporate sponsors. If the health and livelihood of this nation’s oppressed minorities have to be sacrificed in the process, these Republicans won’t bat an eye.
The Black Lives Matter movement claims that racism is endemic among the country’s law enforcement agencies — and Hillary Clinton evidently agrees. Rather than understanding that there are a few bad apples in any profession, they paint all police officers with a racist brush. And now, she’s found a new opportunity to pander some more. Terence Crutcher is a black man who was shot by police officers in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Crutcher was unarmed and in the police video, can be seen with his hands in the air and his back to police when he was first tazed and then shot. At no point does Crutcher make any aggressive moves towards police, yet for some inexplicable reason, he was shot and killed anyway.   The video makes it clear: this was murder, plain and simple. And the officers responsible should be fully prosecuted. There’s no getting around that. But of course, Hillary used it as an opportunity to smear all police officers, and to stoke racial tensions. Appearing on The Steve Harvey Show, Hillary talked about the Crutcher shooting. “We gotta tackle the systemic racism, this horrible shooting again, how many times do we have to see this in our country?” she asked. “This is unbearable and it needs to be intolerable.” Lucky for us, Hillary has a solution to this nationwide problem: vote for her, of course, and these shootings will end!   “Maybe I can by speaking directly to white people [and] say, ‘Look this is not who we are. We’ve got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias’,” she said. “We can do better. We have got to reign in what is absolutely inexplicable.” While she did pay lip service to the many “good honorable cool-headed” police officers around the country, she had absolutely no problem whatsoever exploiting this tragedy in an effort to get more votes. And that’s despicable. She couldn’t even wait for Crutcher’s family to bury him before she started using him as an opportunity to ask people to vote for her. Isn’t she ashamed? Is she not embarrassed? Because really, she should be. What she’s doing is blatant race-baiting. It’s infuriating that liberals can so easily inflame racial tensions for their own gains, while calling everyone else racist. They’re trying to start a race war, and they’re doing it so they can place themselves in positions of power. That’s disgusting. 
Kansas is bleeding money and jobs and Governor Sam Brownback doesnât want the people to know how devastating his economic policies have been. In 2011, the Tea Party governor was so confident that his economic policy of massive tax cuts for the wealthy and reduced spending would turn Kansas into an economic powerhouse that he created a special group charged with writing reports on the results. But Brownbackâs experiment has failed so spectacularly that the state is billions of dollars in debt, education funding is suffering, and job growth is pathetic. So pathetic that Kansas is losing more jobs than it has gained. In January, Brownback couldnât handle a report put together by his group that admitted âKansas sometimes was faring worse than it had before Brownback became governor,â so he made every effort to cover it up. In other words, he censored it because his group was supposed to report that the economy is soaring, not falling to the ground like a rock. Kansas Center for Economic Growth executive director Heidi Holliday blasted Brownback for killing the report. âHe specifically asked the council to hold him accountable through rigorous performance metrics. Five years later, the metrics clearly show his tax experiment has failed while business leaders and local chambers of commerce across the state openly ask him to change course.â In fact, Brownback is so desperate to keep the people of Kansas from calling for tarring and feathering him in a public square that he is turning to the federal government. Instead of writing their own independent reports, the group is now restricted to getting their information from the Federal Reserve, which conservatives often claim is responsible whenever economic issues occur. That particularly surprised Kansas House Minority Leader Tom Burroughs, who was quick to point out the irony. âThe missed revenue marks, missed job reports, missed projections shed light on his failed policies. I kind of find it a little ironic they chose to go to a federal government report after they blamed President Obama for our economic problems.â Governor Brownbackâs economic experiment is a complete failure and a joke. Kansasâ economy is now in shambles and Republicans have no one to blame but themselves. They believed that by implementing an extreme conservative fiscal policy without interference from Democrats that they would prove trickle-down economics as a total success. Instead, it failed miserably and now they want to censor any results from being reported. By all rights, Brownback should have ousted by voters in 2014. But now Kansas is stuck with him and his failed policies for at least another two years. Meanwhile, the wealthy are laughing all the way to the bank. 
Two law firms are suing the University System of Georgia on behalf of three illegal immigrants who were denied admission because they are not lawfully present in the country. The suit alleges that the policy violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution, arguing that their clients are covered by constitutional protections because they were granted DACA status. The Department of Homeland Security, however, denies that DACA confers lawful status, saying it only pertains to prosecutorial decisions regarding deportation. Two law firms are suing the University System of Georgia on behalf of three illegal immigrants over its policy barring persons not lawfully present in the United States from qualifying for admissions. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) and Horsley Begnaud LLC are defending their clients by citing USG’s policy as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. Although the guarantee of equal protection under the law only applies to lawful citizens, MALDEF’s attorneys are arguing that their clients, as individuals who have been granted Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status, are in fact lawfully present.

Saturday Obama gave a speech to the Black Congressional Caucus where he had ample opportunity to give courage to Americans in a scary time. However, he didn’t say anything about the recent attacks then and as of noon (East Coast Time) Monday, President Barack Obama has made ZERO comments on the string of terrorist attacks hitting cities in the United States. Over the weekend there were a number of terror attacks in the name of ‘allah’ that has devastated some communities and killed or injured dozens of people. Check out the list below and tell me if you think the President should have made a speech Saturday, Sunday or especially today to give solace to the victims families and communities being terrorized? Watch the latest video at <a href=”http://video.foxnews.com”>video.foxnews.com</a> Freedom Daily reported earlier: New Jersey, 8am Saturday Suspect: Ahmad Rahami (arrested), possible 4 other suspects in custody from Afghanistan 3 pipe bombs wired together in a dumpster in New Jersey targeting a 5k run for Marines. Minnesota, 8pm Saturday Suspect: Dahir Adan (fatally wounded) Muslim man went on a stabbing spree… stabbing eight people before being shot by police. New York, 8:40pm Saturday Suspect: Ahmad Rahami (arrested), possible 4 other suspects in custody from Afghanistan Manhattan a bomb went off injuring 29 people. Pressure cooker was found with wiring and a timing device. New York, 3:00am Sunday Suspect: Ahmad Rahami (arrested), possible 4 other suspects in custody from Afghanistan Explosive device was found around the Chelsea area. THIS just in- New Jersey, 1am Monday Suspect: Ahmad Rahami (arrested), possible 4 other suspects in custody from Afghanistan Pipe Bomb explodes near a New Jersey train station. I have watched Obama NOT lead for nearly 8 years. His lack of guts, integrity and leadership is the greatest reason that Muslim extremists feel brave enough to walk around American streets with bombs and set them wherever they want. The United States needs a real President who can LEAD America in a time of crisis. If you don’t believe we are in crisis, we are in greater trouble than I thought. 
There’s a plague sweeping across the nation. One that has one washed up football player feeling pretty good about himself. The attention he is getting from his nonsense, is off the charts. (I realize, I’m not helping, but you need to know what’s going on so…) It’s the Kaepernick Plague. It’s wiping out once respected NFL players and really ruined my Monday night football when I learned the Seahawks were talking a bunch of crazy talk. Stupid Kaepernick couldn’t leave my team alone!? Anyhow… Now, you see High School teams, and cheerleaders acting a fool. Pulling a Kaepernick number that should have never gotten an encore. This is when you know stupid has taken over… Half of American ADULTS don’t understand what Kaepernick is doing or why, how do these kids understand it? Seriously, they are doing what they do best at that age, jumping on a bandwagon because it’s apparently the ‘new thing’ to do. Yet, Kaepernick takes pride in it. In fact, so much so that he visited a High School football game in Oakland. You’ll never guess in a million years the kind of stunt they pulled off in HIS honor. Not the honor of what he is claiming to stand for…but in honor of HIM. (which is a lot worse btw…) Here…instead of telling you, I’ll just show you. #ColinKaepernick sat on the sidelines as the #nationalanthem played before the football game at Castlemont High in Oakland on Friday. But what the high school team did as the Star-Spangled Banner played was even more #powerful. Each teen laid on their backs, their arms raised to the sky. A photo posted by ? City Alert ? (@cityalert) on Sep 24, 2016 at 8:39am PDT  The person who made this instagram post called this moment and action… POWERFUL. This is a picture of an ungrateful douchebag disrespecting our nation’s warriors who have given their all for his dumb ass to live the high life, and there sprawled out all over the ground like mindless minions are our children… being brain washed by his idiocy. This was the scene last Friday before Castlemont’s first win of the season against Canada. They took it 40-14, go Knights! #KnightsInAction #MakeAStatement #RespectIt #SupportIt A photo posted by Castlemont Reunion (@castlemontreunion) on Sep 19, 2016 at 1:23pm PDT  But they took it a step further… they decided to honor criminals at the same time they were dishonoring actual heroes. …and there Kaepernick kneels, proud. Like I said earlier, it’s a plague, and it’s gaining momentum fast. Way to divide and conquer Kaepernick. …but just in case you forgot. If this division runs so deep that we end up on two separate sides of the nation. Our side has the legal gun owners, military heroes, and first responders. That’s medical, and police officers. You’ll have the criminals and people who can’t think for themselves. You going to take care of all of them with your millions that you made because of the people sacrificing for you, that you DON’T stand with? Good luck man. 
Mark another university off your list… the University of Vermont this week flew the Black Lives Matter flag beside the American flag and their state flag. No word on whether next week it will be the ISIS flag or not, but it wouldn’t surprise me at this point. So, now our schools of so-called higher education are teaching that a terrorist group that pushes violence and racism should be respected as much as the American flag and our Founding Fathers. That is just obscene in the extreme. If this is symbolic support of their community, I want no part of any of them.  From Gateway Pundit: It’s an Obama world… The University of Vermont this week flew the “Black Lives Matter” terrorist flag beside the American flag on campus. This is what they are teaching America’s children today on college campuses– That a terrorist flag is to be respected and the American flag is to be disrespected. Campus Reform reported: The University of Vermont’s Burlington campus is flying a Black Lives Matter flag alongside both the American and state flags. Several students from the school took to social media to express their support for the move, with some saying the school is “winning for this” and another noting that since the school is supportive of the movement, “we should be too.” One local news outlet is reporting that the flag is being sponsored by the school’s Student Government Association (SGA), whose president called the move a way to “show symbolic support for our community.” The flag is being sponsored by the UVM Student Government Association. They should be ashamed of themselves. The flag apparently appeared on campus the day after the start of the riots in Charlotte, which have now taken one life and injured about a dozen police officers and a number of protesters. Many students at the school are saying they are happy to see the BLM flag on their campus, with some even saying they would like to see the flag stay up on campus “forever.” I guess I should not be surprised. Vermont is uber liberal. Not everyone thought it was keen… “The university is known for being very liberal, but this statement of support for Black Lives Matter goes beyond anything that can be excused,” one student, who did not wish to be identified, told Campus Reform. “A public university, funded by the taxpayers…has no right to make such a blatant political statement. It is inappropriate for a public university, where opinions and views are supposed to be freely expressed, as BLM is known…to stifle free speech.” That flagpole can evidently be sponsored by any student organization for any cause. This one is revolutionary and violent.  
Scroll down for video For those folks paying close attention to the national news, this last year has perhaps been an awakening for many, and no doubt a disappointment for some, as to how our judicial system really works, in that although we’d like to think that “justice is blind” or that there’s “equal justice under the law” in reality there are two distinct and different although parallel systems at work within America. One for us ordinary folks, and another for those political elites, which we seldom get to see, because for the most their malfeasance is usually covered-up and committed by politicians, who for the most part are lawyers, who become judges, who become prosecutors, and who eventually become president, in short a “sheepskin” for some is a legal license to steal, which of course is on full display this election season with Hillary Clinton and her gang. However as this Las Vegas Public Defender found out, wearing a “Black Lives Matter” button into a courtroom isn’t exactly the smartest thing to do, in that she doesn’t belong to the Political VIP Lounge, and of course what transpired next, was a visible clash of cultures taking place right there within the courtroom, as District Judge Douglas Herndon ordered attorney Erika Ballou to remove the button.  “I took an oath to support the Constitution, all of the Constitution,” Ballou said. “My oath is to protect everyone’s free speech, even if I disagree with it. I am not comfortable giving my case to someone else to handle. And I’m also not comfortable abridging my free speech.” She then acknowledged she would not remove the button and wanted another judge to hear the case, which of course Herndon refused to recuse himself. “We’re not here on a petition about a movement or a protest or anything like that,” Herndon said. “We’re here to dispense justice on a criminal calendar of cases. And that’s why I think it’s inappropriate.” One wonders what the reaction of Attorney Ballou would be if a defendant that she was tasked to represent, walked into court wearing a Donald Trump t-shirt, and would she be as adamant in protecting that person’s free speech? Judge Herndon said, “I’m asking the same things of them that I ask of anybody else. Please leave any kind of political or opinion protest statements outside the courtroom.”  The police union’s new executive director, Steve Grammas, sent a letter which objected to “attorneys and other citizens who display ‘Black Lives Matter’ propaganda in court.” “We have received complaints from our member officers who believe that such displays have no place in courtrooms in which justice is to be dispensed,” the letter read. “We are certain that the courts would not allow similar public displays from citizens who believe that killers should be sentenced to death or that sexual predators should be castrated.” Here is the letter in it's entirety: Ltr to Chief Judge David Barker by Las Vegas Review-Journal on Scribd  
Jimmy Kimmel is back with his “Lie Witness News” segment, in which he submits his subjects to comedic man-on-the-street interviews. In this edition, the Kimmel team asked Donald Trump supporters out in Los Angeles their opinion on the presidential candidates’ tax return situation. Over the past year Trump has come under fire for refusing to release his tax returns, defying what has become tradition in presidential elections. The Donald claims to be going through some unspecified “audit” causing him to postpone, also making the case that his supporters don’t really care about his tax returns. That’s exactly what Kimmel wanted to put to the test, whether his supporters would bat an eyelash in their blind support no matter what the tax returns said. So, in order to see if Trump supporters would care at all about the content of Trump’s tax return, the Kimmel team came up with a bunch of controversial questions to ask about a made up tax return filed by Trump that had just come out. “Was it legitimate for Donald Trump to write off his many marriages as “entertainment”? What do you think of Donald Trump listing his primary occupation as “farmer”? What do you think of Donald Trump donating $50,000 to Subway Jared’s Legal Defense Fund?” Sure enough, Trump supporters were immediately, and without hesitation willing to give him a pass no matter how outlandish or controversial the accusation seemed to be, with answers ranging from “It’s a loophole, if it’s there you’ve gotta utilize it” to “You know, we all kind of fib a little bit.” This goes to show,  sometimes we should be shocked, and outraged when we’re lied to. But nothing will shock Trump supporters, and nothing will make Trump supporters budge. Watch below: 
Please disable your Ad Blocker in order to interact with the site. The Media (D) loves to tell the unarmed black man shot by cop story. The problem is, this isn’t that story. The riot in Charlotte was huge and escalated quickly. You know how Keith Lamont Scott’s family has been saying he had no gun and he was holding a book? That was a lie. Watch the News Report: Now watch the Charlotte Police Chief, Kerr Putney: …the media caused all this. More than 1,000 people heard on the news that a guy holding a book was shot by police, and even though these people didn’t know the guy who was shot, they came out anyway and rioted. And yet none of what they heard was true. A man with a gun was told by police to drop his gun, and he did not comply with that request. I hate to tell you this, but that is going to get you shot every time. Not only that, but in this case – contrary to the media’s racist-white-cops narrative, it was a black cop who felt threatened and fired his weapon, and a black police chief who backed up what his officers had to do. Do #BlackCopLivesMatter? …The media’s recklessness unleashed mayhem in Charlotte, for no reason whatsoever. And these malevolent fools will pay no price for what they’ve done. Only the people who had to suffer through this chaos will be paying any price. Read more: Herman Cain The Media needs to slow down and get the actual facts before reporting half-a-story that fits the narrative. Share if you think the Media stoked the flames of racism and are accomplices to the riot in Charlotte 
There is a large portion of the American population that does not believe that the Black Lives Matter movement is actually concerned about the preservation of black lives, rather, they are just looking for a reason to cause chaos and violence. Matt Walsh from TheBlaze isn’t mincing words when he refers to the group as “terrorists.” He gives reasons as to why he believe that with every iota of his being. If you support the message, but not the way BLM is going about spreading it, this may very well be the most important op-ed you read all day.  He starts out with a breakdown of the kerfuffle taking place in North Carolina. If you’re a little confused about what’s going on in Charlotte, North Carolina, allow me to explain: a black cop shot and killed an armed black man, so a bunch of black rioters decided to burn down a black neighborhood and loot black-owned businesses in order to protest racism against black people. Make sense now? Perhaps that is an over-simplification, but he’s absolutely correct. He continues: No, I suppose it doesn’t. There are many questions that immediately come to mind. Questions like: Why are they claiming Keith Scott was unarmed when all of the evidence clearly shows he had a gun? And no matter if the shooting was justified or not, why are they shouting “white cops are devils” when the cop who shot Scott was black? And even if the cop was white and even if all white cops are devils (which seems unlikely, theologically speaking), why are they destroying their own community in response? And perhaps the biggest and most confounding question of all: Why are we still calling this sort of brutal violence, mayhem and criminality a “protest”? At this point, it seems like too strange a coincidence that literally every single Black Lives Matter “protest” involves chaos and bloodshed. I almost said it “descends into” chaos and bloodshed, but that wouldn’t be quite accurate. After witnessing this play out in cities across the country for the past couple of years, I think we can now officially declare that chaos and bloodshed are the point, not just unfortunate byproducts; not the result of an otherwise peaceful demonstration “devolving” into something decidedly less peaceful. The media keeps saying — as it has reported about every BLM riot before it — that Charlotte “started as a peaceful protest” and then became violent. But that’s like claiming a drive-by shooting “started as a peaceful jaunt through the city” until the passengers starting firing indiscriminately out of the driver’s side window. That may be true, in a certain sense, but the drive was always leading inevitably and purposefully to the shooting part, just as these “protests” are, from the beginning, merely a staging ground for savagery, looting and destruction. The riots are not aberrations. They are not surprising and unexpected developments in the midst of otherwise peaceful demonstrations. They are planned, coordinated and widespread. And they seem to only be getting worse with each successive incident. Read the rest of his opinion piece here. It is absolutely worth your time. 
Donald Trump supporters are so desperate to be in power that they are threatening America at gunpoint to vote for him or be killed. Thatâs what Georgia Trump fan Jimmy Arno is preparing for after the election votes are tallied in November because he expects a bloody civil war to break out in order to overthrow the government before Hillary Clinton is inaugurated. Arno is even considering joining a right-wing militia, whom he collectively refers to as âpatriots,â because he seriously believes only they can defend the Constitution. âShould martial law, civil war â whatever â break out in this country, they will uphold the Constitution and rebuild our loss,â he said. âThe war thatâs going to break out if Hillary Clintonâs elected, if that happens. Your patriots are going to overthrow the government.â And of course, Arno is a fan of the Confederacy, loves the Confederate flag, and has a portrait of Robert E. Lee hanging in his living room. So basically, what Arno is saying is that he believes the South will rise again and a civil war sequel will turn out differently. This time a rebellion will somehow succeed even though the United States military, including a navy and air force, would be standing in their way. Nevertheless, threats of civil war and violent rebellion are frightening but they also prove that conservatives are unfit to govern because apparently the only way they can do so is with a gun pressed against the heads of the people. Arno went on to blame President Obama directly for the high racial tensions. âI know that we were a whole lot further along racially eight years ago than we are today,â he claims. But the fact is that Republicans raised those racial tensions themselves by vowing to make President Obama fail from the start simply because of the color of his skin and their claim that he is an illegitimate president. The birther movement, of which Trump is a prominent leader, contends that President Obama is not one of us and that he wasnât born here. The election of President Obama made racists, including Arno, mad so they started publicly throwing a hissy fit and their tantrums have only gotten worse in the last eight years. Hereâs the audio via NPR.  Trump supporters are deplorable people who want to shoot and kill anyone who disagrees with them just so they can watch the world burn. If Hillary Clinton is elected president as she should be, conservatives need to accept that they lost instead of resorting to taking up arms against the country. Such an action is treason and would only demonstrate that they are nothing more than sore losers who should never be allowed to get close to political power ever again. 
“I really support everything President Obama said he would do through regulation on guns but we’re going to start the very first day and tackle the gun lobby.” – Hillary Clinton on MSNBC, 4/25/16 There are those who believe that the 2016 presidential election is a once in a generation, existential kind of national election. These folks notice all of the dangers we face and worry that depending on how the vote falls this November, we may soon be a very different nation than we’ve been. I’m not sure I fit on this worrisome boat, but I do believe that our dearest rights and freedoms are in danger today. The Left has developed a fascist streak unlike any we’ve seen previously in American history, and they believe it to be their duty to destroy our liberty… for our own good, of course. “The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment. And I am going to make that case every chance I get.” – Hillary Clinton, The Free Beacon, 10/1/15 Into this caustic climate comes the NRA, an organization wholly devoted to defending the 2nd Amendment from the gun-grabbing left. The NRA believes that if elected president, Hillary Clinton would do everything in her power to undermine and repeal the 2nd Amendment. Because of this, they are working hard to unmask her as the anti-freedom fascist she really is. Their latest ad paints a disturbing picture, reminding all Americans what is really at stake in the upcoming election.  This is the second in the “Don’t Let Hillary Leave You Defenseless” series. The previous ad covered the disgusting hypocrisy of Clinton’s anti-gun position. Here’s a woman who has lived the last 30+ years of her life surrounded by men with firearms, yet she has the audacity to tell law abiding American citizens that they shouldn’t have the right to use the same tool to defend their families? If it wasn’t such a serious topic, it’d be laughable. “When it comes to guns, we have just too many guns.”— Hillary Clinton, USA Today, 4/20/2016  In November, you can actively defend the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.

From the Daily Caller News Foundation: The man arrested Monday in connection with the New York City bombing sued his local police force over anti-Muslim discrimination claims. Ahmad Khan Rahami filed the lawsuit against cops in Elizabeth, N.J., where he was residing before he planted bombs in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, at a train station in Elizabeth, and on the route of a 5k Marine charity run on the Jersey shore. He claimed police were persecuting him for being a Muslim and subjecting him and his family to “selective enforcement” based on Islam, reports The Daily Mail. Rahami worked at a chicken restaurant called First American, owned by his family, who claimed the police tried to shut it down early each night with “baseless” tickets, and that locals said: “Muslims don’t belong here.” Rahami brought the suit along with his father Mohammad Sr. and his brother Mohammad. He was arrested following a shootout with police Monday, after he was found passed out in the doorway of a New Jersey bar.

There has been a lot of speculation and anger surrounding the shooting of a black man by Charlotte police. Such anger, in fact, has bred more riots in North Carolina, which led to looting, theft of private property and the shutdown of I-85.  But all we’re being told is the side of things where the man was an innocent little cupcake on his way to volunteer at a soup kitchen before he read stories to blind, homeless children and donated all of his paycheck to the local animal shelter. What is the story coming from the police officers involved in the shooting? Does anyone care? Does it even matter what the cops say happened? The riots have already started and the hatred is already coursing through the veins of people who are just looking for a reason to take to the streets, so will this change anything? To those of us who actually uses our brains in these situations, it could make all the difference. The Blaze posted the statement of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief on the incident. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said during a news conference Wednesday morning that officers were searching for a suspect Tuesday when they saw 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott exit a vehicle with a handgun. He says the officers told him to drop the gun and that he got out of the vehicle a second time still carrying the gun. He says the man was shot because he posed a threat. “It’s time to change the narrative, because I can tell you from the facts that the story’s a little bit different as to how it’s been portrayed so far, especially through social media,” he said. As an officer, you’re hearing about your brothers and sisters in blue being shot by thugs who have a chip on their shoulder. You hear this and then you see a man get out of his vehicle with a firearm. You tell him to put the gun down, and he refuses. Are you supposed to wait until he shoots first? If a man breaks into your house, are you supposed to wait until he actually harms you before you protect yourself? How does that even make sense? Oh that’s right, it doesn’t. Of course, that doesn’t stop progressives from declaring that they know exactly how things should be happening. You know, with their degrees in women’s studies and art history, they’re clearly the most qualified people to be criticizing the actions of our law enforcement. 
Caitlyn Jenner has been all over the spectrum the last few months. He even admitted to contemplating suicide. Caitlyn said he was not gay, but straight woman aren’t interested (anymore), he’s confused, he’s got buyer’s remorse on the surgery. His show is canceled. Where does he go from here? Life just hasn’t been greener on the other side for Bruce..Caitlyn…whoever he is today!    US Magazine Reports: “The 66-year-old I Am Cait star — formerly known as Bruce — told Simmons, 46, that she thought about taking her own life shortly after having her Adam’s apple surgically shaved, a part of her body she “always hated.” When a paparazzo captured shots of Jenner leaving the doctor’s office after the procedure in February 2014, the former Olympian said she nearly lost it. “I could not sleep that night. I’m up at 3 a.m. walking up and down my hallway, thinking, Damn, all this s–t is going to come out tomorrow and it’s going to be horrible,” she recounted. “And I said, ‘You know what? Easy way. Go in the other room. You got a gun. Let’s just end it right here.’” The TV personality — who has been open about her brush with suicide with friends and family — added that the whole experience was one of the worst moments in her life.”    It is not a rarity. David Batty in the UK Guardian wrote: A review of more than 100 international medical studies of “post-operative” transsexuals finds up to 20% regret transitioning and no conclusive evidence was found that shows gender reassignment surgery improves the lives of transsexuals, with many people remaining severely distressed and even suicidal after the operation. A staggering 41 percent of transgender people in the United States have attempted to commit suicide. 65 percent of people who’ve had cosmetic surgery, which is relatively minor body alteration, later regret the decision. So it is no wonder that Caitlyn is in this huge state of confusion.   
There are severe penalties for lying in the courts and lying to Congress.  With this premium on truth you would think any government operation would necessarily be truth driven.  After witnessing the idiotic promises from candidates for public office you may begin to suspect that the honoring of truth is only for those who are not in government or who get caught.  The problem is the issue is far more grave than most people suspect even in their most dubious moods.  The issue I am talking about is in the field of government accounting. Now we all know about the $600 hammers and the waste in superfluous studies that find the obvious and spend billions to do it.  But this accounting is small potatoes beside the larger issue of how the government manipulates the core index when trying to downplay the real rate of inflation.  Now just a word about the insidiousness of inflation and the consequences of allowing it to creep into full blown hyper-inflation.  Countries have turned from peace to war, democracies to dictatorships, semi-free to Fascist and completely collapsed because they were unable or unwilling to control inflation.  Check out the demise of major powers past and present and you will find an unsound currency is the one common factor that contributed to the collapse/demise.  And the soundness of the currency was always based on the government creating currency in volumes that had no backing except the promise to pay from further borrowing, taxation and currency expansion ( i.e the printing of paper money ). With so much at stake you would think the government would want to know exactly what is the rate of inflation and how can it be kept under control.  After all how could anyone be so suicidal to hide the figures that would need to be reviewed and acted upon to perpetuate a country’s government?  As I spoke of in an earlier article, politicians are sacrificial both in what they seek and what they ask of their constituents.  This sacrificial banner becomes a shroud for themselves when the seek to deceive and ignore what they think they are getting away with because no one is naming the issue.  This is why they have earned so much distrust and disapproval. Fro a complete understanding of the hideousness of the government’s attempt to distort and hide true inflation rates I refer you to an article written by Jim Puplava at http://www.financialsense.com/stormwatch/2005/0624.html .  What motivates the people on a committee to deliberately distort the way the government determines inflation rates so that the government can continue its deficit spending and ultimately bankrupting  the country?  It is the same motivation of the unrepentant cookie stealer.  They think they can get away with it.  And they can and they will if no one calls them to task and points out the dishonesty they are promoting.  In today’s world of politics it would require a ground swell of voters making enough noise and demanding accurate honest figures but most voters are ignorant of the practices and gullible regarding the truly evil motives at work in the bowels of the very organization that is charged with protecting the country. The irony is the stupidity of those who think they are pulling the wool over the eyes of the populace. What they are hiding are the very facts and figures that will protect not only the country but their livelihood and their ultimate survival.  This is beyond stupid and certainly falls well within the category of criminality.  This in an organization that is charged with protecting the citizenry from criminals.  But what security is there in the fox guarding the hen house? This issue is not covered on the financial channels on TV to any extent.  It is ignored by the press and all the talk radio pundits rarely question what is obvious to everyday Americans watching prices go through the roof.  When the issue is brought up, Americans are prone to trust the government to give accurate figures and believe the inflation rate, no matter how it is computed , is real and there is no need for concern.  As Ronald Reagan said, “ Trust but verify”.  There is no verification to be found that the figures being spouted are true.  The real figures are much higher and this means the government has less financial problems to worry about as long as they can push this scam down the populace’s throat.  The adjustments to Social Security are lower because of these bogus figures, the government debt is viewed as lower because of these figures, the weak dollar is the result of the real figures the government doesn’t want to face up to  and the cheap appearance of the coinage reflects the same phenomena. Now that the American public is getting excited about a presidential race it is time to ask these pretentious candidates what they know about the “core index” that reflects the rate of inflation and what are they going to do to get the government to recognize it is deceiving the American public with its bogus rate of inflation to the detriment of the entire country.  There is not one candidate that has brought the issue up and there is not one who will have a satisfactory answer to why they haven’t.  If you believe the press has commentators that can ask hard questions you need to take a hard look at this very pressing issue and ask yourself why this has not even been raised.  The emperor of inflation is parading around naked as a jay bird and no one in the reporting business has even spotted him. Not only is the government deceiving and manipulating the American public but the free press charged with finding the truth and reporting on it ,is ignoring the very essence of our survival as a nation.  There has been a concern with human cloning expressed by the U.N. and others, but the cloning from our universities has already occurred.  The clones are the genetic/intellectual equivalent of their instructors who dream of a fantasy modeled by Plato’s Utopia and care not one whit about the truth nor the means of attainment. As with the Soviet experiment, what they seek is oblivion. Faking reality doesn’t change reality , it only destroys the dishonest.  Facing reality requires a hard cold look not a placating syrupy soothing assurance that all is well and will turn out for the best if we’ll just be faithful , trusting and above all quiet.  The terrorists on 9/11 offered such assurances to the trusting passengers as they flew into oblivion.  We are passengers in the same predicament and like the passengers in Pennsylvania we need to “Roll” or perish for the ideals of the misguided, misinformed, dishonest pretending to work for the public good. 
President Barack Obama has given what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N. General Assembly, and it was a defeatist doozy on the inadequacy of military power in the struggle against Islamist extremism in Syria and elsewhere. By extension, since the U.S. is the world’s preeminent military power, that would mean our president essentially said we can’t win. Noting the longstanding buildup of militant forces within Islam that have fueled the Islamic State group, Obama cast doubt on the viability of a military solution, The Daily Caller reported. “If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,” Obama said. The president said we must “be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy.” While he granted that this process would have a military component, he also referred to “a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won.” Obama recommended that we “pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.” You can watch here; the relevant portion of the video begins at 29:30.  We could be forgiven for wondering how any of this is supposed to work if we are led by liberal politicians who are reluctant to admit the often-obvious link between violence and radical Islam and who are more likely to criticize Christians than jihadists. We also wonder how any of this is supposed to work if we are led by liberal politicians who have so conspicuously failed to “see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.” It’s not going to work as long we call the good guys deplorable and the bad guys a religion of peace. Think about it between now and November. You’ll know what to do. Share this on Facebook and Twitter and let us know what you think of Obama’s remarks to the U.N. What do you think of Obama's outlook on our military potential? Scroll down to comment below!
When Republicans decided to vote for a guy who promised skip pandering to oligarchs for money, little did they know their presidential nominee meant to hand control of America’s highest offices to those very billionaires directly. Word has leaked that Donald Trump plans to nominate oil executive Forrest Lucas as Interior Minister, breaking the long tradition of naming those from the rural Western states to lead the agency which manages America’s public parks, lands and wildlife. This would be disastrous for the fair enforcement of the Endangered Species Act, protecting the environment from the devastating effects of fracking, and animal rights in general, because Forrest Lucas is the sort of man who literally fights for the right to exploit animals in entertainment and is an avowed enemy of the Humane Society which provides low cost veterinary services, spaying and neutering to pet owners across the USA, as Politico writes: Lucas, who owns a ranch and serves on Trump’s agriculture advisory committee, is one of the biggest donors to groups that attack the Humane Society and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and defend animal agriculture, hunting, meat consumption, rodeos and circuses. Another source with knowledge of the transition operation said Lucas was on a short list of about five names that are under consideration for the post, which has started to attract considerable interest from prominent “anti-conservation zealots.” In a public hint of the rampant nepotism that Trump is planning to make official policy, they even said that the infamous cheetah killer, Trump’s self-entitled son Don Jr., is also in the running for Interior Secretary. The Interior Ministry quite literally owns 28% of America’s land, manages our national parks and forests, the federal Fish & Wildlife Service, and also makes major decisions in the gambling industry because of its oversight of the commission that regulates tribal casinos. The Department of Interior holds massive sway over mineral extraction rights and leasing on public lands too, so the oil industry relies on it for decisions, regulations and pays rent to Uncle Sam through that government agency too. The Sierra Club issued a stark warning about what Trump’s choice means for the country: “Putting an oil executive in charge of our public lands and precious coasts in places like North Carolina, Virginia and Florida is a virtual guarantee that Trump’s promise to throw open season on drilling in our special places will come true if he’s elected.” Lucas is the kind of heartless swine who fought (and thankfully failed) to stop a voter ballot initiative that targeted cruel puppy mills in Missouri in 2010. It’s scary to watch while Donald Trump dangles choices for a powerful appointed public office so outrageous it seems almost comical. If the only two choices are a reactionary oil company oligarch who will certainly plunder our nation’s natural bounty like a child in a candy shop and supports animal cruelty as a policy platform or the silver-spoon-fed self-entitled neo-Nazi misogynist scion who takes pleasure in slaughtering defenseless endangered animals with high-powered weapons, one might ask if this was a made-for-TV movie. But Donald Trump is very serious – as is the threat he poses to our country.  
Never has the “rights for me, but not for thee” idea been more apparent than in the context of gun control. Politicians love to parade around with families of mass shooting victims, particularly if those victims were schoolchildren. They talk about how no one needs ten bullets to kill a deer, and they talk about how semi-automatic rifles – especially the black ones – serve no purpose other than to kill a bunch of people in a short amount of time. The only kind of gun they don’t seem to have a problem with is a shotgun, as long as it’s one that holds no more than two rounds at a time. While these same politicians use shooting victims to push their anti-gun ideas, everyone knows that they are surrounded by armed  bodyguards. Yes, armed with evil guns. Donald Trump brought this up at a campaign rally in Miami, Florida. He said: “She’s very much against the Second Amendment. She wants to destroy your Second Amendment. Guns, guns, guns, right? I think what we should do is – she goes around with armed bodyguards, like you have never seen before. I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons. They should disarm, right? Right? I think they should disarm immediately. What do you think? Yes? Take their guns away! She doesn’t want guns. Let’s see what happens to her. It would be very dangerous.”  Every gun control politician benefits from the Second Amendment. The high-profile ones surround themselves with security personnel who carry firearms. They know that having armed security around them protects them. But they don’t want everyday Americans to be afforded the same right. For now, maybe these gun control politicians would say that they’d be okay if Americans had a shotgun at home, as long as that gun was locked up in a safe and completely disassembled, and the ammo was in an entirely different safe on the other side of the house.

Hillary Clinton’s health is the top issue in the Presidential campaign. Once considered a “conspiracy theory,” Americans now see that Hillary Clinton suffers from serious problems, including neurological diseases. After her September 11th collapse and fainting, even the pro-Hillary media can’t hide the truth. Now, expert Clif Hite (below) comes up with the most compelling theory about Hillary Clinton’s health yet, and you haven’t heard it before. He believes Hillary has died, and is replaced by multiple body doubles and CGI images. If true, this is the biggest coverup in the history of American politics. What a bombshell!: As BeforeItsNews reports: Note: Russian Intel is using my video to prove they used Green Screen in Greensboro! It’s all fake folks! You’ll see my video below. The Russians who track Hillary say she never left Chelsea’s apartment and she’s using doubles! Also check out the part where Russia shows the emails proving Hillary was in a secret plane crash and hurt badly! At first they laugh at Sorcha Faal’s report but then admit it’s “credible”! Huge info here! Stew Webb and Tom Heneghan reported on this plane crash when it happened!  Do you believe that Hillary Clinton was injured or killed in a crash, and replaced by CGI? Please leave us a comment (below) and tell us.  
Harassment is known in Arabic as ‘taharrush’. Mass sexual assault of women in public has been documented in Egypt since 2005 and they recently began calling it the game of ‘taharrush’. Muslim men rape and assault women in public while hiding under protective cover of large gatherings. The Muslim men feel it’s their right because of the misogynistic ideology that women shouldn’t be leaving the house alone and deserve to be shamed using sexual violence. Assailants will create multiple rings around the woman to keep out anyone who tries to rescue them. It’s a really sick practice and women experiencing it could be groped, stripped, beaten, bitten, penetrated with fingers and raped. These Muslim gang rapes have grown and spread since 2012 when large protests in Egypt took place punishing women for attending such protests.   So, it stands to reason that a mass flood of Muslim men who feel that the taharrush of women is okay into Western countries would result in lots of gang rape. This particular story is of an illegal Algerian immigrant who beat a woman unconscious in an attempted rape, who was arrested and explained to the judge what he was doing in Austria. He told the court that he came to Australia to “f*ck the women.” Based on his actions and his previous convictions across Europe, he most likely means to rape women as is the custom of some young Muslim men. After the gang rape, the woman was left lying unconscious in bushes near the bus stop. She had some serious injuries and is considered to be psychologically scarred permanently. Luckily, she found a student who helped her. That student testified that, “The woman came up to me and was covered in blood. You could not see her face. She said to me: ‘I was raped.’” This wave of sexual assaults in Austria and Europe is only going to increase as the migrant population swells.   
Donald Trumpâs campaign manager Kellyanne Conway was backed into a proverbial corner on MSNBCâs Morning Joe trying to defend Trumpâs latest comments. Bloomberg Politics host Mark Halperin first called her out on the fact that Trump called the debateâs moderator a DemocratÂ when that wasnât even true. And, Conwayâs response? Trump didnât lie, he just didnât know. Hereâs Halperin: âHe said Lester Holt (the debate moderator) was a Democrat. Lester Holt is a Republican. How could he say such a thing that just black-and-white factually incorrect?â âI donât know that he knew what Lester Holtâs voter registration is,â Conway said. Conway tried to pivot, saying âfirst of all, if you tell me the media are not overly populated with Democrats, thatâs false,â but Holt just wasnât buying it. âIâm asking about a very specific thing,â Halperin said. âHe made a factual claim about the moderator who deserves the right to be treated fairly and it was just wrong. And itâs a metaphor for his frequently in public stating things with no basis, that are wrong.â After much back and forth, Halperin just became exasperated trying to get an answer out of her. âYouâre not answering what I asked you,â Halperin said. âIâm asking you how someone running for president can assert on the eve of the debate that the moderator is a Democrat, which is factually incorrect? How can he do that?â .@KellyannePolls: Trump âdidnât lieâ about Lester Holt, âa lie would mean that he knew the manâs party registrationâ https://t.co/dZWTCwpoim â Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) September 26, 2016 
In a perfect democracy, there would be multiple viable parties to choose candidates from. Each one would have to work hard and strive for our vote, and each one would have an equal chance at winning. Unfortunately, because of the way election laws and funding are currently in the United States, weâre pretty much stuck with a two-party system and any third-party vote goes to help one of the two major parties. Think Ralph Nader in 2000 and how his votes in Florida gave us George W. Bush. Well, Nader and the Supreme Court. Itâs imperfect, but until laws are changed, it is what it is. No amount of whining or sitting elections out is going to change that. What we need are legislators willing to change the laws, but thatâs never going to happen if people keep having hissy fits. This yearâs election is so criticalÂ not just for the nation, but the entire world. A Donald Trump presidency would be catastrophic on so many levels, both with domestic and foreign policy. Reminding everyone how important this election is, and how a third-party vote will give us a President Trump, is none other than the legendary writer/producer and creator of , Seth MacFarlane. MacFarlane tweeted: âRemember: This November you can help elect President Donald Trump just by voting for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein! Happy Election Year!â Remember: This November you can help elect President Donald Trump just by voting for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein! Happy Election Year! â Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) September 19, 2016  His sarcasm is more a terrifying wake-up call than just witty banter on the Twitter machine. Does this mean you shouldnât vote for Stein or Johnson? No, of course not. However, it needs to be brought to peopleâs attention that their vote for a third party isnât actually going to put their candidate into office, but rather have the possibility of ushering in the apocalypse with Trump. A âconscience voteâ does not do anyone any good with a Fascist in the White House, and it goes much deeper than just feeling good about yourself on election day. So, do what you do. Thatâs your freedom to do so, but remember the unintended consequences of that vote and what will be in store for the entire world. 
Obama has known from the very beginning that there are terrorists among the unvetted refugees he is bringing in. That was a certainty. He just doesn’t care. When he first said he wanted to bring in 10,000 refugees, I laughed. I told people he was planning on 250,000 and people laughed at me. Now he says 110,000 and I’m telling you, it will be way more than that and many of them will be ISIS connected. Obama is not only terraforming the US into a Muslim nation, he is deliberately bringing terror and chaos to our streets to destroy us. Just as he has done with race wars. It’s been the plan all along. Now they have the chutzpah to actually admit they know it, but they are still defending their actions. They have no intention of slowing down, much less stopping the influx. This is one of those areas that I agree with Donald Trump on… this must be stopped until we can adequately vet these people. Obama now knows that Hillary could lose, so he is doubling down on this and violence and death will follow.  From the Daily Caller: Islamic State terrorists have tried to pose as refugees in order to gain admittance to the U.S., Department of State spokesman John Kirby admitted Wednesday. “I wouldn’t debate the fact that there’s the potential for ISIS terrorists to try to insert themselves,” Kirby said on Fox News. “And we’ve seen that in some of the refugee camps in Jordan and in Turkey, where they try to insert themselves into the population.” He was defending President Barack Obama’s plan to bring in 110,000 new refugees in the next year, a huge increase from the 70,000 the U.S. typically admits, saying the vetting process is “good.” Any sane leader after having their country hit with numerous terrorist attacks, many of which are directly traceable to refugees, would back off and consider their actions and the consequences. But not Obama. We got hit by at least three terrorist attacks last week and he went to the UN and went all out for bringing in far more refugees. Obama hates America and he is a traitor to this country. Every action he has taken while in office screams that he is an enemy within. Yet, we are doing virtually nothing to stop him. Terrorism and dead Americans are the result of our apathy and complacency. Obama and his administration admit that this will end in terrorism. We know it will too. Why are we just letting this happen? Has America lost her will to fight and survive?  
This Friday, the Trump camp released a new list of ten more potential judges that he would consider to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court. This list includes a former law clerk to Justice Samuel Alito, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT). Lee believes that federal child labor laws, Medicare and Social Security are all unconstitutional and is arguably the most conservative member of the United States Senate. The list gave us new reasons to fear the Presidential candidate, by giving us insight into the legislative agenda the Donald will push if elected president. The list was tailored to appease hard line conservatives and skeptics, containing candidates from the whole spectrum of the right, from judges who believe the less the judicial branch intervenes the better, to those that want to get rid of the minimum wage and fundamental labor legislation guaranteeing basic protections. Mike Lee, in a statement, said he appreciated being considered. “Right now I’m focused on my job in the Senate, where I’m in a good position to defend the Constitution by fighting against government overreach. Both lists that I’ve seen from the Trump campaign are fantastic.” In 2010 Senator Mike Lee described his interpretation of the Constitution in detail in a since-deleted YouTube video. In a segment of the video, Lee calls attention to the “toughness” of the decision in Hammer v. Dagenhardt, which challenged a federal law abolishing child labor by asserting child labor laws ought to be within the power of the state instead of federal jurisdiction. Congress decided it wanted to prohibit [child labor], so it passed a law — no more child labor. The Supreme Court heard a challenge to that and the Supreme Court decided a case in 1918 called Hammer v. Dagenhardt. In that case, the Supreme Court acknowledged something very interesting — that, as reprehensible as child labor is, and as much as it ought to be abandoned — that’s something that has to be done by state legislators, not by Members of Congress. […] This may sound harsh, but it was designed to be that way. It was designed to be a little bit harsh. Lee uses this separation of powers argument as his defense for a number of other “tough,” radical right ideas about peeling back federal powers. That’s because Lee is part of a movement whose members are convinced New Deal-era reformers plotted to “illegally” exploit Depression-born desperation and expand the federal government’s powers. People within this movement interpret the 10th Amendment of the Constitution as explicitly prohibiting spending programs and regulations disfavored by conservatives. Programs such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act are illegal in the eyes of people like Mike Lee, borrowing ideologically from the John Birch Society and the Libertarian Party platform of 1980, which demanded that we live in a completely darwinistic, plutocratic, and privatized world where there is no taxation, no safety nets of any kind, and political strings are entirely pulled by the purse, with zero checks on the marginal power of capital. The prospect of appointing someone like Mike Lee to the Supreme Court is terrifying because his agenda is to unleash unlimited spending in political elections to opportunistically help himself, while helping corporate stooges repeal every major piece of legislation that has resulted in gains for the poor, the homeless, the sick, the middle class, and the most disenfranchised in America’s marginalized communities.
NASCAR is under fire like never before, quite like this nation. Earlier this week we reported that NASCAR was getting sued $500 million after being accused of having unfair advantages for race car drivers. Specifically white race car drivers. Terrance Cox III, who is the CEO of Diversity Motorsports, filed the racial discrimination claim due to minorities being denied basically any chance in the sport of NASCAR. NASCAR quickly came out with a statement explaining why all of that was wrong.  Here’s what Cox stated: “In 2016, motorsports remain the most racially segregated sport in the United States. [NASCAR has] been complicit in, and supportive of, the racially discriminatory environment that virtually excludes African Americans from meaningful participation in motorsports racing in the United States.” NASCAR however completely disagrees seeing that they have programs designed specifically to end racial discrimination in the sport. “Diversity both on and off the track continues to be a top priority for NASCAR and its stakeholders. We stand behind our actions, and will not let a publicity-seeking legal action deter us from our mission.” Whether we believe it or not, racial discrimination is still present here in America. NASCAR may not be guilty of it, but America as a whole is. Recently police in Charlotte, NC shot a black man and killed him. Keith Lamont Scott was approached by police when they were searching for a man under warrant. Scott was not the man they were looking for, but police stated that he appeared to be holding a gun. According to onlookers and family, Scott was reportedly holding a book that he was reading beforehand, and it looked like that was enough to lead policemen to believe it was a weapon.  Because of this act, people of Charlotte were completely outraged. They began protesting on that day and have not stopped protesting since. Just last night, protesters went wild and violent. One person was shot while multiple shops and buildings were looted. One of those buildings was the NASCAR Hall of Fame in Charlotte. They have closed down for now, according to Bob Pockrass, reporter at ESPN. “NASCAR has closed its Charlotte office for normal business today. During the unrest Wednesday night in Charlotte, windows were broken on the ground floor of the building tower where NASCAR offices occupy several floors.” Here’s a news video of the past 24 hours in Charlotte.  We are praying not only for the members of NASCAR but for this nation. That we would see the love of God prevail throughout these horrible times.
In today’s world, if you really want to ruin someone’s life, you attack them…digitally. It’s 2016 and the world is run by tech. Everyone’s lives are written out on social media, in online banking, in cookies and in their history. Hackers all over the world steal identities and assets and sell them.  Everything is run by computers it seems and it’s generally a way to make human existence easier, convenient and safer in most cases. But when technology goes wrong, it can do a lot of damage. It truly is a chilling world with all the types of hacking that are out there and with the automated car becoming the transportation of the future, hacking is seeming to be a bigger concern. In the past, DARPA researchers found weaknesses that would let a hacker shut down the brakes on some cars, while other research teams have found a simple text message can be enough to gain access to your car’s computer. Now, a team of Chinese researchers have figured out a way to hack into the car brains of a Tesla.   The good news is that Keen Security Lab are “white hat” hackers. Meaning they are employed by Tesla to find and report security vulnerabilities in order to make the stuff we use safer. So yeah…no need to worry about the Chinese government hacking into American vehicles…yet. The remote access allowed the hackers to do just about anything they wanted with the car. They don’t seem to have been able to compromise the car’s autopilot feature, but what they can control is still worrying enough for potential consumers to put a hold on purchasing one of these bad boys. Better to be safe than sorry. Tesla owners have the ability to upgrade their cars by downloading the latest patches. That’s what makes Tesla different than other vehicles out there. It’s pretty much a driving computer. 
Donald Trump’s efforts to attract any kind of support from the African-American community has not gone well. After blatantly whitewashing four hundred years of oppression and enslavement by telling American blacks that they’ve “never had it worse” and then telling his supporters that the police brutality protests in Charlotte were due to “drugs,” Trump’s campaign tried to visit a civil rights museum in North Carolina to for a cheap photo-op – but couldn’t even muster the effort to pretend to be sincere about it, and he was resoundingly denied: “We did not honor the request of the Donald Trump team because we thought they demonstrated, in their approach was disrespectful” said the co-founder of the International Civil Rights Center and Museum, Earl Jones.  “The approach, the type of disrespect, pretty much a demand and bullying us to use the museum in their manner and their way in their time,  it was inappropriate and I think it’s probably reflective of the type of insensitivity of civil rights and human rights that’s reflective from Trump over the years.” Jones complained that Trump’s staff was “aggressive” and “rude,” and that Trump’s camp apparently demanded that they close the museum for five hours to accommodate him. “We have equal treatment for everyone coming to the museum and we welcome everyone to the museum but we are not going to allow the museum to be used for political gain.” While it’s not a surprise to learn that the members of the Trump campaign are rude, pretentious scumbags, it’s truly illuminating just how deep racism and self-entitlement runs through every level of the “Trump Train.” We applaud Mr. Jones and jeer at Trump’s people for being entirely incapable of pretending to care about the African-American community. His insistence that blacks have “never had it worse” implies that they had it better under slavery and Jim Crow, which is a white supremacist line of thought to the core. How any black American could support Trump is beyond comprehension.
The pro-gun crowd loves guns first, and respect last. At least, that seems to be the case with whoever made a truly horrible meme out of an old black-and-white war photo. The photo depicts troops executing a couple of people in the back as they kneel in front of a mass grave. The troops âare just obeying orders,â and the dead in the mass grave are âcitizens obeying gun laws.â This is the meme:  We donât know who created this, but we donât have enough middle fingers to express how we feel about them. The piece of shit behind this is no doubt someone who believes the lie that, had the Jewish citizens of Germany and elsewhere just had guns, the Holocaust wouldnât have happened. The photo in the meme is from the German-occupied Soviet Union, and depicts one of the mobile execution squads known as the. They were tasked with mass executions of Jews, communists, and anyone else that the Nazis decided werenât suitable to living their empire and master race. Tens of thousands were murdered this way â they are part of the Holocaust. The myth of guns and the Holocaust is so completely and terribly wrong it defies description. Yes, the Nazis seized guns from their enemies, however, they actually didnât make much of a dent in total gun circulation in Germany, contrary to what the gun-rights crowd wants us to believe. Furthermore, the Nazis actually loosened gun laws in 1938 for everyone except Jews. People who have a basic understanding of Nazi Germany know that the Nazis targeted more groups than Jews, and they know that more people than Jews opposed the Nazis however quietly they had to. Why didnât those people, who own guns, rise up? Itâs because of the power of a police state â the very thing the âmoar gunzâ crowd fears the most. Therefore, the cretin who came up with this meme can rightfully be termed as having no clue what they are talking about. But worse than that, That is just abominable, and has no place in any discourse at all. Hereâs why: âThis historical second-guessing is deeply offensive to Jews, Holocaust survivors and those who valiantly fought against Hitler during World War II. It is, in fact, as many historians haveÂ previously noted, a distortion of history itselfâ¦ â¦When you manipulate the history of the Holocaust and use it to score political points, its wholly inappropriate and offensive. Especially for the sake of the victims of the Nazi onslaught and their memory, it must stop.â Thatâs from Jonathan Greenblatt, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League. He was speaking against Ben Carsonâs painfully offensive assertion that the Nazis had disarmed everyone so they could kill Jews with impunity, but itâs just not true. And itâs an serious affront to every single victim of the Nazis, as well as everyone who fought them. This memeâs creator ought to go back to the depths of the hellish abyss that first spat him out. 
A Dallas police officer, seeing red after several shootings of police officers, has decided heâs had enough and he and his lawyer, are going to punish everyone they absolutely can for allegedly conspiring to create a race war. Yes, this is the same ârace warâ that the entire right sees whenever people call attention to the racism that permeates our justice system. Police Sergeant Demetrick Pennie, a 17-year veteran of the Dallas police force, is suing leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement â along with the Rev. Al Sharpton, billionaire George Soros, Louis Farrakhan, former Attorney General Eric Holder, President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and many more. The bizarre part is that he and his attorney, right-wing nut Larry Klayman, actually see an active conspiracy here: âThis is a civil action for the deprivation of Plaintiffs and other members of the class herein of their civil rights, conspiracy against the Plaintiffs and other members of the class herein civil rights and obstruction of justice to prevent the enforcement of civil rights.â The complaint also says this: âKlayman received a call from Defendant New Black Panther Party and Black Lives Matter acting in concert with the other Defendants, all of whom are working together to ignite and continue the race war they have fomented, threatening to kill him and his family.â [emphasis mine] In discussing the July 7 murders of Dallas police officers, the lawsuit states that the shooting suspect claimed he was acting alone, and was not affiliated with Black Lives Matter or anything else. An investigation into his background allegedly revealed that he was a member of the Nation of Islam and the New Black Panther Party. Apparently, thatâs enough to tie him and these groups directly to Hillary, Obama, Holder, and everyone else, although itâs hard to see how Klayman and Pennie actually know thereâs a conspiracy here. Itâs like they just â the complaint repeatedly states something along these lines: âDefendants, acting in concert, and each and every one of them are inciting the imminent serious bodily injury and killing of police officers and other law enforcement personsâ¦â âActing in concertâ means thereâs a knowing cooperation between two or more people to accomplish something. Thereâs no real, concrete evidence that anybody is actively working with anyone else to incite violence against police officers. Yet, they keep using that phrase. We do not think it means what they think it means. Either that, or a frightening amount of paranoia fueled this. Or both. Itâs probably both. The complaint also accuses everyone of spreading the fiction that police officers âare intentionally and systematically targeting and hunting blacks and other minorities to kill them for no reason other than racism or sport.â Exaggerate much, Klayman? Lords, gods and minor deities, itâs amazing these conclusions are in an actual complaint filed in an actual court. Other known problems, such as arresting or shooting black people not guilty of any crimes, and that minorities are arrested and prosecuted disproportionately to the general population, are fiction on the planet from whence this complaint arose, too. Klayman, however, has been looking for a reason to file a suit like this for some time. Back in July, he threatened to sue Obama, Farrakhan, Sharpton and Black Lives Matter for putting his life in danger âas a white person.â At the time, he said things like this: âIt is no wonder some cops, fearing for their lives in this anti-white, anti-Semitic and anti-Christian environment, sometimes are prone to literally pull the trigger too quickly.â Heâs not exactly the most credible person here. He has an axe to grind, and it doesnât make Pennie look good for retaining him for this suit (or did Klayman persuade Pennie to finally give him what he needs to make a suit stick? We may never know). The discovery phase of this lawsuit ought to be interesting. The entire 66-page complaint is below: [scribd id=324251965 key=key-2XEsBrU2vkK8S40trOMu mode=scroll] 
On January 20, 1961, newly elected and duly sworn into office President John F. Kennedy, a Democrat, ended his memorable and stirring inaugural address with the words “asking for God’s help, here on Earth, God’s work, must truly be our own.” Despite his obvious moral failings in his private life, President Kennedy’s personal ambitions were transcended by his belief that his primary duty in public life was to love his country and to serve her people. That said, we also know he was a Democrat, and the last Democrat to serve as President, whose efforts as Chief Executive were meant to build up America, rather than to tear America apart. Following the tragic assassination of President Kennedy on November 22, 1963, up to and including the present, there have been four more Presidents from the Democratic Party: Lyndon Johnson, (1963-69); Jimmie Carter (1977-81); Bill Clinton (1993-2001); and Barack Obama, (2009-?). Under their individual and collective brand of so-called leadership, the United States of America and her people have been steadily and systematically dismantled, fragmented, weakened, and mercilessly abused. During these past 50 years, thanks to the national Democrats and the left-wing allies in Congress, the White House and our Federal Court System, the national Democratic Party has become America’s largest and most powerful “hate group.” Lyndon Johnson, also known as “LBJ” took America into the malicious morass of the Vietnam war, and into the abyss of the equally malicious lie known as the “Great Society,” spending hundreds of billions of dollars on a vast system of socialist welfare spending that perpetuated poverty, especially in our cities and our minority communities, in a deliberate move to weaken the poor and less advantaged into federal dependency. At the same time, we fought an undeclared war in Vietnam and Southeast Asia for a decade, resulting in more than 58,000 needless deaths in the U.S. Military, only to lose the war and witness the humiliation of reunification of North and South Vietnam into one Communist nation. LBJ partnered with another, degenerate member of the Kennedy clan, Ted Kennedy, to engineer passage in 1965 of new immigration laws that started the stampede of mass legal and illegal immigration that eventually evolved into the “open borders” mess that brings in terrorists, America-haters and uneducated millions who promptly entered the social welfare system immediately upon arrival. James Earl “Jimmie” Carter, sat fecklessly in a cardigan sweater by the fireplace one January evening and told Americans that we were in a “malaise,” or more directly expressed, Americans were in a foul mood, anxious and frustrated by both an economy in shambles with high unemployment and high inflation, as well as a foreign policy that created the conditions to begin the awakening of long simmering but dormant radical Islam, with the takeover of the American Embassy and the “triumphant” return from French exile of the Ayatollah Khomeini to Iran and leadership in 1979. Carter sat in a cardigan sweater and blamed Americans for a mood of “malaise” that Carter created. Jimmie Carter’s primary accomplishment in four years as President was the humiliation of America before the rest of the world, as well as his own place in history as having been humiliated personally in the eyes of the majority of Americans. William Jefferson “Bill” Clinton began his Presidency on January 20, 1993 with his “gratuitous” attendance at the “Gay and Lesbian Inaugural Ball” in Washington, beginning on day one of his Presidency to repay the support in his election campaign of the LBGT Lobby. Soon after, Clinton announced the rueful break with two centuries of military tradition and law by instituting the infamous “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy permitting Gays to serve without fear of discharge. He put “Hillary the Horrible” Clinton in charge of an ill-fated attempt to ram socialized medicine down the throats of the American people, and Bill Clinton, with the successful enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement or “NAFTA”, accelerated to “warp speed” the exodus of American businesses, jobs, and wealth to foreign nations such as Mexico, that had begun in the 1970s. Later in his Presidency his womanizing caught up with him and, after having one or more sexual affairs in the White House, was impeached by Congress, not for womanizing but for proceeding to lie to Congress and lie to the entire nation by denying the sexual immoralities. Three previous Democratic Presidents had succeeded in seriously damaging and weakening America, by the time the notorious Barack Hussein Obama was elected and sworn in as the 44th President on January 20, 2009. His eight years in office have included the most reckless borrowing and spending of any administration in history. Half our entire national debt ($10 Billion of the $20 Billion) was created in just the past eight years of Obama’s tenure. Yet Mr. Obama has absolutely nothing to show for all that reckless spending. The economy is in shambles, the infrastructure of highways, bridges, and public lands is crumbling, while the military forces and weaponry that must defend our nation is being systematically dismantled. Meanwhile tens of millions of Americans have been added to the already overwhelming financial burden in government through swollen welfare rolls, food stamps, forced early retirements, long term unemployment, and social security disability fraud. Mr. Obama, whose sworn duty along with Congress under the Constitution is to “promote the General Welfare, has instead promote the welfare of every small minority and special interest groups imaginable, in response to their collective loud potty mouths, collective asinine demands, and their collective calls for elevation to privileged and special legal status of their immoral and degenerate agendas. Mr. Obama has used the “bully pulpit” leadership tradition begun by Teddy Roosevelt, not to uplift, inspire and unify, but instead to berate, lecture and divide Americans. To Barack Obama, “(radical) black lives matter”; “gay and lesbian lives matter”; “radical Muslim lives matter”; “illegal alien lives matter”; convicted criminals lives matter”; meanwhile, the lives of ordinary, law-abiding, responsible working Americans, do not matter; the lives of Christians, foreign and domestic, do not matter; the lives of American military servicemen and women do not matter; the lives of our veterans do not matter; the lives of the “thin blue line” of peace officers in our police and sheriff departments do not matter; and, with all certainty, the protections due to Americans under our Constitution and the Bill of Rights, in the mind of Mr. Obama, do not matter at all. In the half century since the assassination of John F. Kennedy, under the Presidency of the four Democratic Presidents that followed, as well as the years of Democratic control of Congress, and Federal Courts, the national Democratic Party has deliberately and with malice aforethought trampled on the general welfare of the decent, hardworking and law abiding majority in America, while trampling on our rights and wastefully expending our tax dollars, to pay false homage to dozens of undeserving but vocal and demanding minority special interest groups, to the severe detriment of the much earned and deserving general welfare of the vast majority of our nation’s citizens. The national Democratic Party has become nothing short of America’s most powerful “hate group.” The American left wing, socialists and Democrats are the party that despises, attacks and works diligently and unceasingly to destroy all that is good within America. This “hate group” called the national Democratic Party demonizes: (1) law abiding morally upright American citizens; (2) unborn children; Christians; (3) Constitutional Conservatives; (4) legal gun owners; (5) job-producing energy businesses in oil, gas and coal production; (6) rural and small town America; (7) the ranching and farming West, including the “horse culture “ of wild mustangs and ranchers; (8) small business owners; (9) our police and our military, including veterans; and (10) above all, the Democratic party despises God, the Bible, Christianity and the ethical moral codes and common law inherent to Judeo-Christian foundations cited by the Founding Fathers 240 years ago. Although the Judeo-Christian, moral and ethical, Constitutional Conservative American majority is clearly despised by the “hate group” called the Democratic Party, we the American majority do not hate, because Jesus Christ taught us that the greatest commandment of all is to love one another, and not to hate the sinner, but to instead only hate the sin. The vast majority of Americans should, and indeed do, hate sin. However, the Democratic Party clearly despises us. To paraphrase John F. Kennedy’s words from 1961; Americans who are Constitutional Conservatives, Christians and law abiding, ethical citizens must “help every friend, and oppose any foe.” We must love and support each other, but at the same time, we must band together and fight the Left Wing. We must fight the evil of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. We must fight the immorality of communism, fascism, radical LBGT groups, radical Islam, collectivist Socialism, radical Atheism, and every foe of our Constitution, Bill of Rights, and Ronald Reagan’s “Shining City on the Hill.” A famous aphorism states, “All that is required for evil to prevail is for good men and women to do nothing.” Above all, therefore, righteous, conservative and patriotic Americans must fight evil, so that the good may once again prevail in America in the historically prevailing form of “Liberty, Justice and Virtue.”  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.
Donald Trump is, well, deplorable. Heâs suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned ârapistsâ and âdrug dealersâ from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration campsÂ as a âtemporary measure.â Heâs even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad: âThe other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, donât kid yourself. When they say they donât care about their lives, you have to take out their families.â But heâs not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donaldâs Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism â heâs fighting the ânarrativesâ of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trumpâs ânarrativeâ is âkill them allâ: Last weekendâs attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obamaâs watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes weâre in more than a fight about ânarrativesâ â these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens. Pay attention to that last bit: âThey must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.â Now, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is âradical Islamic terrorism,â and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating âterrorists?â âTheyâre protecting each other, but theyâre really doing very bad damageâââthey have to open up to society and report the bad ones,â Trump saidÂ in March. âWhen they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and thatâs a big problem.â If Muslims are âprotectingâ terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trumpâs eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terroristsâ families. How would he define terrorism? These are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself â but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponentsâ security to âsee what happensâ to them (shortly after suggesting that âSecond Amendment Peopleâ could deal with them. Weâre dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the âlittle red buttonâ that launches our nuclear arsenal. Itâs also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen â one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald. Normally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. Heâs said it himself. Many times. If we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation â to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if itâs the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be. 
In another revelation from WikiLeaks we find even more information! Hillary has accepted donations from the head of a company who has also accepted donations from ISIS…good gosh, just when you think this vile woman couldn’t get any worse!   The company is French industrial giant Lefarge, from which Hillary accepted over $100,000.  Let us also not forget this:  What is also shocking is that the City of Paris signed contracts with this company, despite information linking them to the Islamic State. TheCanary.Co reported on this shocking discovery: Documents obtained by several journalistic investigations reveal that Lafarge has paid taxes to the terror group to operate its cement plant in Syria, and even bought Isis oil for years. Yet according to the campaign group, SumOfUs, Lafarge is the corporate partner and sand provider to the City of Paris for this summer’s Paris-Plages urban beach event. The project run by Office of the Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, will create artificial beaches along the river Seine in the centre and northeast of Paris. Lafarge also has close ties to Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Apart from being a regular donor to the Clinton Foundation, Clinton herself was a director of Lafarge in the early 1990s, and did legal work for the firm in the 1980s. During her connection to Lafarge, the firm was implicated in facilitating a CIA-backed covert arms export network to Saddam Hussein. The report went on to confirm that the company’s Paris office was well aware of the operations conducted with the Islamic State for cement and oil transactions. Lafarge bought oil for its own operations, but also allegedly supplied the Islamic State with cement for its operations. You can’t sit on the fence with a terrorist organization, you’re either with them, or you’re not. You can’t have a middle ground because if you try to they will OBLITERATE YOU. You don’t mess around with terrorists unless you are in clear support of them. Hillary has borrowed over $100,000 from the very company who’s in support of ISIS, you know the group of crazy Muslims that want us all dead. Hillary Clinton is a traitor.  Unfortunately, the laws don’t apply to Hitler…I mean Hillary.
From the “You Just Can’t Make This Up” Department comes this story about the latest words that anti-free speech progressive leftists want to eliminate from the lexicon because of some contrived grievance or offense. Now, believe it or not, the term “American BBQ” has been determined to somehow be offensive by a college full of numbskulls. The fine people over at Campus Reform, who are keeping track of this kind of idiocy, report: Students at Ramapo College were recently forced to change the theme of an “American BBQ” because the administration deemed it too “offensive.” According to emails obtained by Campus Reform, Ariana Rivera, the Assistant Residence Director of Bischoff Hall, sent an email to the College Republicans and the College Democrats on August 17 inviting the groups to co-sponsor an American-themed BBQ with Bischoff and Mackin Halls. What in the hell is offensive about “American BBQ?” Can you think of anything? Me neither. However, according to emails obtained by Campus Reform, the term was somehow determined to be “military and recruitment-oriented.” No kidding. Maybe it’s the term “American” that bothers these idiots. It’s getting pretty obvious that the Left wants all speech banned — all speech that they disagree with. Does political correctness know no bounds?    Email Subscribe
On Monday, Donald Trump fulfilled his duty as a presidential candidate by praising law enforcement for catching Ahmad Khan Rahami, who was responsible for the Saturday bombing in New York City. Twitter This would have normally been a nice gesture, if it hadnât been a contradiction of something Trump had said just a few minutes before. Fortunately, whenever Trump flip-flops or lies, Americans are able to instantly respond and call him out on his bullsh*t via social media â and they didnât hesitate to remind Trump that just a few minutes before he congratulated law enforcement for Rahamiâs capture, heâd dissed the NYPD for allowing âpolitical correctnessâ to interfere with catching terrorists. Among the first to point this out was MSNBCâs Christopher Hayes, who tweeted: Â  Twitter Â  Hayes was referring to a disrespectful comment Trump had made on Â shortly before he congratulated the police officers, in which he said: âYou know, our police are amazing, our local police. They know who a lot of these people are, they are afraid to do anything about it, because they donât want to be accused of profiling, and they donât want to be accused of all sorts of things.â Yup â Trump had accused the NYPD of being cowards and knowing who terrorists are, yet he has the nerve to congratulate them in almost the same time frame. Other people recognized this epic fail as well, and blasted the Republican nominee for being so untrustworthy and two-faced: Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter This tweet was particularly funny, and Iâm sure there will be some backlash for Trump to deal with: Twitter Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump has defended law enforcement far more fiercely than African American police brutality victims to help paint the picture that he is a âlaw and orderâ candidate. But thanks to his asinine comments about law enforcementÂ having blood on their hands by assisting terrorists, Trump has probably just ruined a year of pro-law enforcement campaigning. 
Don’t stop sharing this until it’s burned into everyone’s minds what cops go through everyday. Don’t stop sharing this until EVERY American understands that sometimes officers have to make the most difficult decision of their lives… To fire on a suspect who they believe might try to kill them. WARNING: GRAPHIC VIDEO OF AN OFFICER’S DEATH BELOW Kyle Dinkheller was a deputy with the Laurens County Sheriff’s Department in Georgia. He was 22 years old when he was killed in the line of duty. Dinkheller’s story, and the video that captured his death have been part of police training for 15 years. The extremely graphic video which also captured Dinkheller’s screams as he was shot 9 times, with a 10th and final fatal shot to his eye, is evidence as to why officers do not have the luxury of hesitating when confronted with a suspect who is disobeying orders. It was on Monday, January 12, in 1998 when Dinkheller pulled over Andrew Howard Brannan for going almost 100 miles an hour near the town of Dudley, Georgia. The stop was uneventful, initially. When Dinkheller pulled Brannan over, Brannan exited his vehicle, and the two greeted each other. Brannan put his hands in his pockets shortly after. Deputy Dinkheller asked Brannan to keep his hands in plain sight. That’s when the encounter went south. Brannan became agitated, told Dinkheller to shoot him, and then began dancing crazily on the road. Dinkheller radioed for backup, and ordered Brannan to desist and approach his police cruiser. Brannan then rushed the deputy in an extremely hostile manner. Dinkheller used his baton to keep Brannan from reaching him. That’s when the suspect retreated towards his Toyota pickup truck. Brannan reached inside of his truck even though Dinkheller ordered him not to do so. The suspect then produced an M1 carbine rifle. Dinkheller can be heard repeatedly yelling at Brannan to “put the gun down now!” Deputy Dinkheller continued telling Brannan to drop his weapon for about 30 seconds. That’s when Brannan opened fire. Bullets can be seen hitting Dinkheller’s cruiser’s window in the video. Dinkheller returned fire, but did not hit Brannan. With his magazine empty, Dinkheller was forced to reload. It was at this point that Brannan rushed the deputy and began to fire at him at close range. Dinkheller, hit several times, is heard screaming in terror saying “Sh-t! Sh-t! Stop now!” Brannan then ran to the front of Dinkheller’s cruiser and reloaded his weapon. Dinkheller fired a shot at Brannan, at which point Brannan rushed the deputy while firing his rifle. Dinkheller was hit several times. The 22-year-old’s screams are difficult to listen to. Returning fire, one of the deputy’s bullets did in fact find its target, hitting Brannan in the stomach, but it wasn’t enough to stop him. Dinkheller, having been shot 9 times, was immobilized. That’s when Brannan, standing over the body of Dinkheller, took careful aim and shot him in the right eye while yelling “Die f-cker!” Brannan, now a murderer, ran to his truck and sped away. He was arrested the next morning. On January 28, 2000, Brannan was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to death. The jury concluded that he “murdered Dinkheller in a premeditated, torturous, and cruel manner.” Fifteen years later Brannan was executed. On January 13, 2015, he was given a lethal injection. While awaiting his execution Brannan was asked why he killed Deputy Dinkheller. His response? “Because he let me.” A few weeks prior to Dinkheller’s death, the young deputy had been reprimanded for being to “aggressive” during traffic stops. He was afraid of losing his job if he overreacted while on patrol. Many believe that was the reason he did not fire on Brannan when he reached inside of his truck. Truly tragic if that was the case. Here are the still photos of the scene. The first is the outline of Dinkheller’s body. His blood can been seen on the ground. The second photo is of Dinkheller’s cruiser, and the evidence markers denoting where bullet casing were found.   Every single person in America should see this video. Especially black Americans who believe they can disregard orders from police and not expect the most serious of consequences. Deputy Dinkheller gave his killer one too many chances. Police academies nationwide use this video as a training tool as to why officers cannot hesitate in situations such as this. Tulsa police officer Betty Shelby was just charged with first-degree manslaughter for shooting Terence Crutcher, a black man who ignored her orders not to return to his truck much like in this video. Officer Shelby most likely was shown this video during her training. She knew what the consequences could be if she hesitated. Watch the video of Deputy Dinkheller, and the hesitation that lead to his death. WARNING: EXTREMELY GRAPHIC VIDEO & AUDIO OF A MAN’S LAST MOMENTS ON EARTH  Color of skin is irrelevant. When cops are confronted, they just want to make sure they don’t end up like the deputy in this video… Dead. Don’t Stop Sharing This. Every American should see it. Especially those in the African-American community. The perp who killed Dinkheller was white, and he SHOULD have been shot the moment he reached into his truck. We’d expect the same if the perp was black. By Jeff Rainforth Like Jeff on Facebook Follow Jeff on Twitter 
According to Charlotte Police, about 70% of protesters in the area are not only out-of-staters, but are “criminals.” “This is not Charlotte that’s out here,” a spokesman for the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Fraternal Order of Police said. “These are outside entities that are coming in and causing these problems. These are not protestors, these are criminals.” “I’m not saying all the people, but we’ve got the instigators that are coming in from the outside. They were coming in on buses from out of state. If you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night. I can say probably about 70% of those had out-of-state IDs. They’re not coming from Charlotte.” In fact, according to police, these troublemakers were bused in from out of state just to wreak havoc on the city. We saw the same thing happen in Ferguson. #Charlotte police: 70% of arrested protesters had out of state ID’s, outside entities are causing these problems https://t.co/Kwya2xXerk — OutFrontCNN (@OutFrontCNN) September 22, 2016  These people are purportedly protesting systemic racism in law enforcement. While that is something that might be worthy of discussion – definitely not worth looting a Walmart over – what’s interesting is that the cop who shot Keith Scott was a black man himself. According to Scott’s family, he didn’t have a gun and claimed that he was reading a book while waiting for his son. However, after Keith Scott was shot, police recovered no book from the scene, but did recover a small, loaded handgun. Here’s cell phone footage that Keith Scott’s wife took during the incident.

CBS exposing Obama paying for the renovation of mosques is actually a story from 2015. But it got little media attention then and he’s still doing it. He’s diverting hundreds of millions of US dollars to overseas mosques to renovate them. Tell me again how he is not a Muslim. This just screams it. And people wonder why he grovels before the Mullahs of Iran… why he gives ISIS a pass… why he is terraforming the US into a Muslim nation. Set aside for a moment that we are broke, due to Marxist policies implemented ever since Reagan left office… it’s where the money is being spent that makes your blood run cold. By all accounts, we are funding Islamic terrorists right and left. We are funding their countries, their schools, their mosques… we are funding their wars as well, even against America.  From TruthFeed: “You Didn’t Build That”…Oh Wait, You Did! A CBS news investigation found that the Obama State Department is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to save mosques overseas — outraging taxpayer advocates and raising enormous questions about aid to potentially terror-supporting groups with U.S. foreign aid. The United States ‘investment’ of millions to refurbish mosques as a ‘good-will effort’ in Muslim countries has upset many.   “We are spending money we don’t have. This is all on a gigantic credit card right now,” said Jared Thomas, a taxpayer advocate. Millions more dollars have been sent to places like Cyprus. The State Department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with U.S. tax dollars. Many of us lost almost everything in the last economic downturn. Fully one third of Americans are now out of work. We can’t make ends meet and our country can’t pay its bills… yet somehow, Obama can send well over $770 million to Islamic countries to refurbish their mosques. It makes your eyes bleed. The State Department declined a CBS Atlanta News request for an interview. Anchor Justin Farmer wanted to ask why we are using tax dollars to refurbish religious buildings overseas – something we all want to know. The State Department did send CBS Atlanta News an email saying that they are: “Fighting Islamic extremism by building relationships with Islamic leaders.” What bovine excrement. Let me spell it out. Our so-called wealth is being redistributed to Islamists and their countries. Our treasury is being emptied and given to terrorists. Then we invite these enemies in and place them in positions of power in the US. And while we are at it, we bring in hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees and place them throughout the country, especially in conservative strongholds, thereby changing and controlling the voting demographic. This is a coup from without and from within… the enemy is now among us. 
I think what’s most likely is that the audience just thought the candidate was being funny. I mean, isn’t it a joke to say that anyone in the Clinton family is honest? Even if it weren’t a joke, the congressional candidate on the Democratic ticket had to have known that his comment would have elicited laughter from the audience. He made his comments during a debate with incumbent representative David Jolly. Former Florida Governor Charlie Crist is vying for Rep. Jolly’s spot in the state’s 13th congressional district. The moderator had asked Crist if he was planning on voting for his party’s nominee. Here’s how he answered: “I am proud of Hillary Clinton. I think she’s been a very good secretary of state, a very good senator from the state of New York. The thing I like most about her is I believe she is steady. I believe that she is strong. I believe that she is honest. And I look forward to voting for her.” “Honest” and “steady,” huh? That had to have been a joke. I don’t know exactly what he meant by “steady,” but that’s an interesting way to describe Hillary, especially in the midst of her health crisis. Why would he refer to her as being steady? She would have collapsed at that 9/11 memorial event if it weren’t for her security detail breaking her fall and carrying her into the van. The crowd reacted appropriately as one does when a comedian pokes fun at a politician.  Even Democrats understand Hillary’s aversion to honesty. A staggering 64% of voters – and that’s including Democrats – believe that their candidate is not honest or trustworthy, according to a recent Fox News poll. Of course, it probably won’t stop them from voting for her just the same.    The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.
Hillary Clinton’s totally tone deaf Clinton Foundation will be honoring a Palestinian teach. The problem arises when you learn that she is married to a terrorist. Hanan an-Hroub will be speaking at a Clinton Global Initiative event to honor her for a teacher award. The event takes place in New York. How’s that for location? Read the story below.  As Written By Joel Pollack for Breitbart: Donald Trump is criticizing Hillary Clinton over the fact that the Clinton Foundation is honoring a Palestinian teacher whose husband is a convicted terrorist on Tuesday evening. Hanan an-Hroub is scheduled to speak at a Clinton Global Initiative event in New York after winning a $1 million teaching award from another charity that donates to the Clinton Foundation. Her husband, Omar al-Hroub, spent 10 years in an Israeli prison for his role in a 1980 bombing that killed six Israelis. The event is going ahead as planned, in spite of the recent Islamist terrorist bombings in New York and New Jersey, which injured dozens. The Wall Street Journal noted Tuesday: Omar al-Hroub was convicted on charges that he was an accomplice in a deadly bombing attack in Hebron that killed Israelis walking home from Friday night Sabbath prayers. According to an Associated Press account at the time, Omar al-Hroub was a chemist who provided chemicals needed for making the bombs. Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller said ….

A suspicious package was found outside of a McDonald’s in Manhattan, leading Times Square to be evacuated. The New York Police Department closed 42nd Street between 7th and 8th Avenues in Manhattan, where the package was found. The area is known to be a tourist hot spot in Times Square. Not long after the package was found, the bomb squad arrived to investigate.  Our @fox5ny live truck was here for story before 42bd St was evacuated for suspicious package in front of @McDonalds #timessquare pic.twitter.com/lRkRmConvh — Liz Dahlem (@lizdahlem) September 21, 2016   People alerted police when they saw the package, later confirmed to be a suitcase.  MY DAD SAW A SUITCASE LEFT IN FRONT OF THE TIMESQUARE MCDONALDS AND TOLD THE POLICE AND THE STREETS ARE CLOSED AND ITS ON TV😵 — Stace. (@StaceyG999) September 21, 2016   Thankfully, after the bomb squad investigated, it was confirmed that the suitcase was empty and there was no threat. The streets were reopened and it was back to business as usual in Times Square.  Business as usual on 42 Street. Everything back up and running after bomb scare #TimesSquare @fox5ny pic.twitter.com/mvxbPUV3wa — Liz Dahlem (@lizdahlem) September 21, 2016   After the bombing in Chelsea, New Yorkers are understandably on high alert for any kind of suspicious behavior or unusual packages. Thankfully, it was a false alarm, but the people who spoke up absolutely did the right thing by notifying police. We know there are ISIS sleeper cells in the United States. There have been multiple confirmed terrorist attacks recently. It’s not the time to be complacent; everyone needs to be keeping their eyes open and be on the lookout for people behaving unusually. Remember: if you see something, say something. That’s true now more than ever. 
Watch this thug knock out two beefy girls in a restaurant (video below), then we’ll have a fun chat about it afterwards. Maybe some wine and frogs, but that’s none of my business. So the skinny guy in the wife-beater, how appropriate, was arguing with the two booger monster looking ladies who seem exactly like the type of gal a black man loves. You know, big ol hips, stanky tattoos, and lack of a father figure. They’re all going buck wild on each other and you know it’s only a matter of moments until someone gets triggered and ends up on WorldStar HipHop. Finally someone says something and it looks like some drink goes flying, glass shattering, fists flying boogaloo instead of people slurping down milkshakes and hamburgers. If Soul Train was a battle royal in a diner, then this would be it. If Ed Norton’s fight club was coed, then this would be it. I am Jack’s big booty ho getting beat up by a black man.  He knocks out one crumb-eating gal with a right hand, then I can’t even tell what happened to the other lady. I just see blond hair flying, red shirts ripping, flea-bag cheap tattoos exposed and I was legitimately hoping a breast didn’t come out as I laughed at this awful video. Normally I enjoy a fine chest peek during a chick fight, but I am not interested in women this size. Not my type. After several rounds of fists and kicks, the man has now assaulted two women. The girls are pretty ugly, but that doesn’t make it OK to strike a woman. If he were a real man, he would have walked out with his dignity instead of sucker-punching it into the large forehead of these women. Hillary Clinton calls Trump supporters deplorable, but she should probably show this video at her next rally if she’s not too sick to stand up and press play on the remote. If anything is deplorable, it’s this behavior and a man assaulting two women. Hopefully they’re ALL arrested. And if you missed it, there was a cameo by the chef and a deplorable butt crack by the lady in the red shirt. I don’t want my strawberry pancakes at the diner interrupted by nonsense like this. Do you?  If you really need to be disturbed. Then imagine what would happen if this guy showed up to the fight. What on God’s given Earth is this creature? Don’t worry, that’s a man. You can look at it and not feel like a fake transgender creep in the Target bathroom.  Weird. I know. 
Saturday’s bomb blast in New York City injured 29 people, and 9 more people were stabbed by the Muslim attacker in St. Cloud, MN. on the same day. Not to worry though, “Aleppo Gary” is on top of it…and he’s “just glad no one got hurt.” Could you just put the bong down until the campaign’s over Gary?      
A Ukraine policewoman is dead after contracting tuberculosis from a suspect that spat in her face. Arina Koltsova, 35, was arresting a man on New Year’s Day when the suspect spat in her face, the Daily Mail reported. She didn’t know the man had tuberculosis at the time. Koltsova went untreated for some time until she collapsed at work one day. She was then diagnosed with tuberculosis and started treatment.  “She became ill after New Year's Day,” Her on-duty partner, Officer Mikhail Kindrakevich, told the Daily Mail. “She had arrested this guy and he spat in her face. Some time later she collapsed. She had received treatment. She underwent chemotherapy, she was fed food through an IV drip and she had lost a lot of weight”  Koltsova died on July 25. She was buried in Kiev two days later. “This is an irreplaceable loss for the whole of Kiev police, fond memories of Arina will remain in our hearts forever,” Koltsova’s police department wrote on its social media page.  “Arina wanted to change something for our country,” wrote one of her friends. “Joining the police was a conscious choice, she wanted to change things for better.”  According to the National Institutes of Health, tuberculosis can be treated by taking antibiotics six to 12 months. Some cases can be drug-resistant and are not easily treated. It is unclear if Koltsova had a drug-resistant form of tuberculosis or if she was not diagnosed quickly enough for effective treatment. It is unclear if the suspect will be charged in Koltsova’s death.  Sources: Daily Mail, Inquistr, NIH / Photo credit: Arina Koltsova via CEN
An article by former assistant U.S. attorney Andrew C. McCarthy in National Review on Monday that is critical of Democrat Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton’s counterterrorism efforts has been censored by Twitter as being “unsafe” in their view. The article, titled “The Mulish Stupidity of Clinton-Obama Counterterrorism” when clicked on from Twitter, results in the following ominous-sounding warning:  Andrew McCarthy, who led the 1995 terrorism against  Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman and eleven other radical Islamic terrorists, announced the censorship in a separate post on National Review on Monday evening. In the article, McCarthy makes the point that the today’s defenders of radical Islamic terrorism — progressive leftist Democrats — sound precisely like the attorney’s representing the Islamists in the cases he prosecuted in the 90’s. “As I have previously recounted, when I prosecuted the Blind Sheikh’s terrorist cell in the mid-Nineties, the defense lawyers for the jihadists – who sounded just like today’s anti-anti-terrorist progressives – claimed that their clients had been lured into terrorist activity by U.S. government policy and by the enticements of a government informant who spouted Islam-against-the-world rhetoric. In response to this fatuous contention, we put a very simple question to the jury: “What would it take to turn you into a mass-murderer?” What policy could be so bad, what rhetorical us-against-them flourishes so inspiring, that a person would join the terrorist cause and commit acts of barbarism?” Read more of the article that Twitter doesn’t want you to read HERE.

President Obama is right — it appears the people running the Trump campaign skipped their history and civics classes. After Donald Trump got a lashing from black activists after claiming it’s “never been worse” for them than it is right now, one would think the campaign would have gotten the message and moved on accordingly. Wrong. As usual, no one in the Trump campaign learns their lesson. And their sheer ignorance has cost them a key staff member in a key swing state. Trump’s campaign chair in the prominent Mahoning County in Ohio, Kathy Miller, has resigned from her position after denying there was any racism in the 1960s and that if black people weren’t successful in the last 50 years, it’s their own fault. She also said there wasn’t “any racism until Obama got elected” and skirted problems under the table: If you’re black and you haven’t been successful in the last 50 years, it’s your own fault. You’ve had every opportunity, it was given to you. You’ve had the same schools everybody else went to. You had benefits to go to college that white kids didn’t have. You had all the advantages and didn’t take advantage of it. It’s not our fault, certainly. Miller then doubled down, calling the Black Lives Matter movement a “stupid waste of time” and said low voter turnout in the African American community as due to “the way they’re raised.” What does “the way they’re raised,” supposed to mean? Maybe Miller should take a look at the fact that the Trump kids didn’t vote (and couldn’t even vote for their dad) before speculating on how an entire race raises their kids. Miller resigned, gave a half-ass apology, and distanced herself from the campaign. Of course Trump’s Ohio state director, Bob Paduchik stressed that Miller’s comments were not reflective of the campaign, and reduced her position to that of a simple “volunteer” to steer away any influence she once held. Once again, the Trump campaign deflects, blames, and dodges responsibility. Oh, and it once again shows that it’s being run by a bunch of entitled white racists. 
The Children of Abraham of the Southern Tier, an interfaith organization in Johnson City, has taken offense at the 9/11 memorial raised in the nearby Town of Owego, New York. This association of misguided multiculturalists and Muslim moderates allege that identifying the perpetrators of the worst individual act of aggression on American soil would encourage Muslim hatred, never once excoriating the very act that resulted in the death and injury to more than 3,000 American victims and 453 responders and boundless grief for their families and for all Americans. Did the moderates ever attempt to apologize for the horrific crime that forced people to jump to their death rather than be burned alive? Did they express their sorrow for the victims and heroic rescue workers, or atone in a way to benefit the families that suffered such tragic loss? Do they even acknowledge that Islamic terrorists continue their march of evil, putting America and Europe on high alert for 9/11, or that this was part of Islam’s perpetual holy war against every living being on the planet. No. And the city manager’s overtures were also snubbed. The Muslim residents of Johnson City may be moderates who never take up a lethal weapon for Allah, but they are engaging in a subtle act of civilizational or settlement jihad. Such people are comparatively discreet in Western society, going about their lives inconspicuously, but effecting regime changes in gradual increments. By their refusal to acknowledge the obvious links between Islam and 9/11, they shield those who spew hatred against America, Israel and democracy; they empower the academics and students who vilify Israel and Jewish students on campus, and they facilitate the crossing of borders for hijra (conquest by increased population). Under the guise of injured sensibilities, they insist on the removal of anything that may identify those who pursue our destruction and conquest with Islam, hoping to erase the ugly truth that fourteen centuries of barbarism continues unabated in every country where Islam is found. They would have us believe that a tiny minority is to blame, but a recent Pew Research poll shows that 51 percent of American Muslims choose to be governed by sharia; 30% believe it is legitimate to use violence against those who insult Muhammed, the Koran, or Islam; 25 percent believe violence against Americans can be justified as part of the global jihad; and nearly 20% believe the use of violence in the US is justified in order to make sharia the law of the land. When presented with a choice when sharia conflicts with the US Constitution and Bill of Rights, 33% say sharia should be supreme. That’s some minority! Politically, 48% are Democrats, 19 percent Independents, and 19 percent Republicans. Islam already regulates our speech through our government, our media, and the constant hazard of being damned as Islamophobic to those who dare to speak up. They cover their tracks through leftist academics, a strong BDS movement, and textbooks crammed with indoctrinal and fallacious material. Continuing along those lines, the Johnson City assemblage is working to remove from future knowledge the history of 9/11 that was carved into the granite. If we fail to yearly observe significant events as the bombing of the World Trade Center, the signing of our Declaration of Independence, our victory in World War II, and more, our youth will be robbed of their identity, their heritage, and America as we know it. Wisdom is defense. Ignorance of our journey through history is the greatest threat to our survival. It should be noted that this interfaith group’s complaint was not that they, too, should have paid homage to America’s fallen or, specifically, to Owego’s citizen, Derek Statkevicus, who lost his life that day. Neither were they inspired to erect a monument in their own city or to join Owego residents in a fight against the greatest scourge of mankind with its unspeakable crimes done in the name of their religion. Rather, they express a phony outrage that the criminals have been identified with Islam! Often enough, other Islamic groups attempt to blame 9/11 on American citizens, on Jews or Christians, but this one is working to eliminate the obvious first, to claim that the 19 were unknown, came out of nowhere, and bombed America for no specific reason. Removing the offensive truth from the monument will leave room for revisionism later, just as Major Nidal Hassan (Fort Hood Massacre) was called anything but what he was, and his jihad massacre was officially named “workplace violence.” Instead of condemnation or owning up to the demands for death inherent in the Koran, these individuals hope to gradually erase the event from our memory and from generations to come – just as Islamists have obliterated or renamed many artifacts and historic tombs to create their own narrative, just as their counterparts in Israel are trying to stop archaeological excavations from revealing more of Jewish history. These Children of Abraham may well be the Islamic families that escaped tyranny but, unfortunately for the rest of us, they nurture their children with intolerance and harshness, creating a new, young generation of jihadists. These offspring may become the young men enticed online to join ISIS’ executioners, or the young women lured to sexual slavery for the Palestinian cause. We must continue to remind ourselves of the anger, the tears, and the patriotism that were triggered that day of September 11th, fifteen years ago, and realize that we are in more danger now than ever before. The Middle East has grown bolder and more violent. Islamists are acquiring newer, deadlier weapons, and more of their numbers are making their way into Europe, North and South America, bringing with them new plans to terrorize and infuse their way of life into ours. Islam has been at war with the world since the seventh century. Their holy book is a dedication to brutality and conquest, so that even their own people are condemned to grope in the darkness of oppression and poverty. In the name of their god, they must erase the past to support their own supersessionist narrative, and we must never oblige them. The more that Americans accommodate such requests and attempt to correct or crush our own speech, the more power we will hand to them. Unless we weigh the long-term ramifications of the growing adjustments we make to our lives for the sake of theirs, we will lose our freedoms to their tyrannical sharia laws. In the words of Hassan al-Banna, creator of the Muslim Brotherhood (1929), “It is the nature of Islam to dominate, not to be dominated, to impose its laws on all nations and extend its laws to the entire planet.” If the hate feared by the Children of Abraham does arise, it will be because of Islamists’ deeds, not the attribution on a memorial stone. 
Just like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit, Hillary Clinton and her minions could never, ever in a million years pass a background security check. There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that’s no joke. They shouldn’t be cleared to clean a toilet there. The Daily Caller News Foundation has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training, briefings or courses on said security. Not only are these people willing morons concerning security, they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn’t do. It’s called deniable plausibility. The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents. Will they see them before the election? A judge has ordered it… I wouldn’t hold my breath.  From The Daily Caller: A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department’s motion to dismiss TheDCNF’s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also denied TheDCNF’s request to depose State Department officials. The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan. Huma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, I don’t look for them to do so this time. And for some reason they are never held to account for it. The rest of us would be in jail… guess we just aren’t the ‘right people’. Judge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th. Bradley Moss, one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF, said “Judge Leon’s Order made clear his frustration with the State Department’s continued obstruction of the FOIA process. State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.” I hope they carry through with those consequences this time. It’s getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell. The word for this is ‘corruption’. State Department officials admitted in a July 29th response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the “courses were not completed” by Clinton or her aides. Well, duh. That’s for peons, not the elite evidently.  
One does not have to bleed red, white and blue in order to live in this country. However, whenever I encounter anti-American vitriol that masquerades as “enlightened” political correctness, I always wonder, “If you hate what this country stands for, then why do you live here?” That’s the question that should be posed to those who have forced students to change a school event’s “American theme” because it is supposedly offensive.   Students at Ramapo College in Mahwah, New Jersey, were planning on putting on a themed barbecue event for fellow students and faculty. The theme was “America.” As students made preparations for the event, however, they were informed by staff that they would have to change the event as the patriotic theme was too “offensive.” The staffer who issued the edict, Bischoff Hall Assistant Residence Director Ariana Rivera, claimed that, among other things, the use of Uncle Sam on flyers was too “military and recruitment-oriented.” Because college students looking for a good pulled pork sandwich might instead join the Army? Doubtful… Rivera claimed that the order came from the administration. When asked who was issuing the order, she replied, “To be honest, I’m not sure. I think it was administrative. I was told that our advertising was too ‘military and recruitment-oriented,’ because we had the Uncle Sam saying ‘I want you.’ I think? However, we saw other posters with that same idea, so I really don’t know.” The event went forward with a watered-down theme and around 300 students were in attendance. College officials remained elusive and cagey about the reasoning behind the demands and claimed that the issue was a “miscommunication.” Still, students tasked with putting on the event have vowed to move forward with finding answers for why there was an issue in the first place. In either case, what seems the most troubling is not just that there seems to be a pervasive element in academia that despises patriotism, but that people have become so comfortable with redundant bureaucracy that orders are passed-on mindlessly without ever discovering who is issuing such ridiculous orders and why. “Because we said so” is the mantra of all bureaucratic tyrants. 
Animals behave better than this. After the shooting of a black man by a black police officer, things spiraled out of control in Charlotte, North Carolina. Last night was a lot more peaceful, but the two previous nights were hellish. One protester eventually died after another protester fired randomly into the crowd and shot him in the head. Almost a dozen police were hurt as were numerous protesters. Bricks, bottles, rocks, plants… whatever they could find, protesters threw at the police. The police in turn used tear gas, pepper spray and flash grenades. It was a war zone. All of this started when the suspect’s family starting spreading the false story that the man was unarmed and reading a book while he waited for his son to get home from school. No book was found, but a gun was. The man got out of his car with a gun drawn from a thigh holster. He got back in the car and then got out again with the gun once more. An officer shot him after he repeatedly refused to drop the weapon. His family incited violence and rioting as did a Muslim man who represented them. They should be arrested.  From The Federalist Papers Project: Robert Gehl reports that rioters in Charlotte in their second night in a row rampaging the city tried to throw a photographer into a bonfire they started in the middle of the street. Local station WCCB reported in a tweet Wednesday night that its reporters witnessed “protesters” trying to burn the photographer alive.  The statement was repeated by Marvin Beach, a reporter for WCCB on their live stream. Beach said the station’s photographer witnessed the attack. As The Daily Caller reports, it’s unclear exactly why they tried to throw the photographer on the fire, or why it failed, but the livestream apparently later captured police providing assistance to the unnamed photographer, indicated he was unharmed. The photographer was apparently white, raising the specter that he was targeted because of his race – There have been many cases of race-oriented violence during the two-day chaos. The worst example of the barbaric behavior that occurred this week was when a white photographer was grabbed by Black Lives Matter goons who then tried to throw him into a fire and burn him alive. He was evidently unharmed, but that could have cost him his life. A statement by a reporter named Marvin Beach on WCCB’s livestream of the riots, said the station’s photographer witnessed the attack. It’s unclear why the effort failed, but WCCB’s livestream later captured police providing assistance to the photographer, indicating he was rescued without suffering grievous harm. What kind of monsters do something like this simply because of race? They are doing everything they say they are protesting against. This will not end well if it keeps up.  This is what you wanted, America.https://t.co/fLTyk3IrT2 — Roark (@Roark__) September 22, 2016    
World-renowned writer/director Joss Whedon has returned to social media with a vengeance and a message that needs to be heard by everyone. Especially those who are apparently severely apathetic to the election this year. The director and creator knows all too well that we canât sit this election out and has recruited some of the biggest names in the entertainment industry to get his message out there. His Save the Day PAC is described as such: âWe are a short-form digital productions company dedicated to the idea that voting is a necessary and heroic act. That every voice in this wonderfully diverse nation should, and must, be heard. That the only thing that can save democracy is the act that defines it. We are committed to fighting the apathy, cynicism, and honest confusion that keeps citizens from using their vote. And to reminding an increasingly out-of-touch and compromised set of representatives that they are answerable to the people they were hired to serve.â Itâs clear in the video that Donald Trump must be defeated for the good of all humanity, so it makes absolute sense that Whedon would use those who have played superheroes in his movies to get this very important message across. Itâs absolutely important that we all vote, not only for president, but also for legislators all the way down to the local level. This election defines not only who will lead the nation, but also who will sit on the Supreme Court, and as Whedonâs video points out, itâs a âtipping pointâ for the world. Sitting at home because you think both parties are equally as bad isnât only wrong, itâs dangerousÂ and allows that which we despise the most to gain power and control. Go here to visit Save the Day PAC, register to vote, and make sure your voice is heard. Watch the video here:  
Donald Trump has economic advisers that have helped him develop a plan that will grow the economy. It is in great contrast to the socialist economy the Hillary has planned for you. It addresses the current regulatory burden, energy, and trade in a manner that will meet your approval. Read some of the specifics for yourself.    As Written By Newsmax: Donald Trump’s economic plan will “significantly increase America’s real GDP growth rate” – resulting in trillions of dollars of additional revenues, according to a new study authored by investor Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro, a top economist at the University of California. “When evaluated as a single integrated whole, the Trump plan is revenue neutral and fiscally conservative,” Ross and Navarro write in the study. Ross, one of the nation’s most respected private equity investors, and Navarro serve as senior economic policy advisers for Trump’s campaign. “It grows the economy much faster than Hillary Clinton’s plan to raise taxes, increase regulation, stifle our energy sector, and perpetuate chronic trade deficits,” the study finds. Meanwhile, Trump’s economic plan “proposes tax cuts, reduced regulation, lower energy costs, and eliminating America’s chronic trade deficit,” Ross-Navarro say. The authors conclude that “Hillary Clinton’s economic plan will inhibit growth.” Hillary Clinton “proposes higher taxes, more regulation, and further restrictions on fossil fuels that will significantly raise energy and electricity costs,” the report states. “Clinton will also perpetuate trade policies and trade deals she has helped put in place that have led to chronic trade deficits and reduced economic growth.” The economists write that Trump’s reforms in trade, regulations and energy would result in revenue gains of $2.374 trillion, making the ….

Hillary Clinton was giving a speech in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Monday, she appeared to have something quite off about her appearance. Watch her eyes! What is up with that? It looks almost neurological. We are not doctors but someone needs to check this out its almost a loss of control of her eyes. Make sure you watch her left eye (our right) and then replay it and watch how they are not really in sync with one another in several instances.
As cities are burned in wake of yet another “peaceful protest” involving uninformed public that don’t wait for the facts, it should come as no surprise to anyone that when the facts are released, a different story resents itself altogether. Terence Crutcher was a black man shot by police earlier this week. Immediately the media portrayed it as “unarmed black man shot by racist white cop.” However, when more details came out, it’s clear that the media did its best to bury the story and glom onto the newest “victim” of the media’s outrage machine. Here’s the truth of what happened, and it’s every Black Lives Matter supporter’s worst nightmare. Not only did Crutcher not have his hands raised, but it appears that the officer’s account of him reaching in the car was justified, as well as the bombshell that PCP was found in his car, with the jury out on if it was in his system. If it was, that lends credence to the officer’s story, making him incredibly hard to subdue. According to Bearing Arms, Numerous media organizations that should know better, from Sky News, to Reuters, to NPR, are claiming that white Tulsa (OK) Police Department officer Betty Shelby shot and killed Terence Crutcher standing in the road with his hands up. That is a demonstrable lie, as proven with simple screen captures from video footage from the police helicopter circling overhead.  In the photo above, Crutcher, wearing a white shirt and tan pants, can be seen walking away from Officer Betty Shelby. His hands are clearly raised… at this precise moment.  Unfortunately for all concerned, Crutcher does not obey lawful commands to freeze, and walks back to his vehicle.  As shown above, Crutcher walks to the driver’s side door, and his right hand is still clearly raised. His left hand is still up as well, but blends into the dark color of the windows.  As Mr. Crutcher squares up with the driver’s side door of his vehicle straddling the centerline of the road, his hands are still raised. But they don’t stay there.  As the helicopter continues in a counterclockwise turn, Mr. Crutcher clearly drops his hands to his side.  As we can see above, Mr. Crutcher’s right hand has dropped and is just in front of his waist. His left hand still appears to be up and positioned near the upper door frame or “A” pillar.  At the moment just before Mr. Crutcher simultaneously shot once by Officer Shelby (right) and tased by Officer Tyler Turnbough (left), Mr. Crutcher’s hand is clearly down near his waist near the right front pants pocket area. This is when both officers decided to discharge respective weapons.  The image above is just after Mr. Crutcher was simultaneously shot once in the chest and tased.  In the image directly above, Mr. Crutcher has just been shot, and the wound to his chest is just starting to bleed. throught the hole. Mr. Crutcher will begin bleeding much more profusely within fractions of a second, then roughly 2 seconds later, he will collapse to the ground. Here’s the video. Watch it for yourself. * * * Without passing any judgments one way or the other on whether Mr. Crutcher’s actions warranted the shot fired by Officer Shelby, one thing is 100% clear, and that is that Terence Crutcher’s hands were not raise when he was shot, but down by his side. The mainstream media is, universally and without question, lying to you about the circumstances of Terence Crutcher’s shooting. Read more here… 
Update: Buzzfeed has deemed that our description of the crime and the victims is false. We have utterly debunked Buzzfeed’s claims. You can view our followup article here. ~~~ You can’t make this stuff up. People used to tell crazy stories, but have no way to prove if the story was true or not. Then along came video. This is by far one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen. These guys are out in the middle of the street and it looks like there was supposed to be a fight of some sort. Because you know how fights are, they’re even better when they’re in the middle of a major road. Out of nowhere someone lights them on fire. LIGHTS. THEM. ON. FIRE. And they’re still in the middle of the road, running around like crazy where they may get hit by a car.  Nothing but absolute chaos and easily one of the most disturbing things I’ve watched since the Casey Anthony trial. What goes through someone’s deplorable brain when they’re thinking – well right about now is a great time to light these guys on fire. Yup, let’s just toss this cocktail over on them and watch the men burn. Who carries the items needed for a good Molotov cocktail anyway? Was this premeditated? It’s not like I have the items needed for a good cocktail laying around unless it’s a Bloody Mary on a Sunday morning. Back in the day, when people were a lot smarter and America was great, this would have been a lot different. If you see two people about to fight and they’re in the street, then the good people will make sure that the people fighting aren’t getting hit by a car. The good people used to make sure it was a fair fight and would stop the fight when it got out of hand. That was when people were a lot smarter and had more human nature to them. Nowadays everyone whips out the cell phone and let’s a slightly bad situation turn into the worst possible situation just so they can grab a viral video out of it. No one cares anymore. Time to start caring about people and stop lighting them on fire. 
For many Americans, the choice they make on their ballots in November has everything to do with the role the next president will play in shaping our Supreme Court. Conservatives have emphasized how important it is that we elect someone who will fight for and preserve our constitutional rights by nominating justices who follow in the footsteps of the late Antonin Scalia. Both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have laid out their plans for the country if elected, but, as pointed out by conservative evangelical leader Franklin Graham, only one candidate has released a list of potential Supreme Court nominees — Trump. “The public needs to recognize that this presidential election is not about personalities the way the media is trying to make it sound,” Graham wrote in a Facebook post Monday. The prominent religious leader argued, instead, that this presidential election is about filling the Supreme Court vacancy with someone who will follow the U.S. Constitution. “This court and their rulings on issues of religious freedom, marriage, abortion, and much more will impact this country for our lifetime and the lifetime of our children and grandchildren,” Graham wrote. “There’s so much on the line here.” Pointing out that the next president would nominate at least one justice — and potentially several more — over the next four years, Graham asked his friends to “pray about who to vote for.” But, he also challenged us to educate ourselves on the candidate’s potential Supreme Court nominees, so we will know where they stand on the future of the nation’s highest court — something that is possible with only one candidate, Trump, because Clinton has not released a list of names she would consider.  On Friday, Trump released his most recent update to a list of potential Supreme Court nominees, and it included a highly qualified and diverse field of candidates that is sure to satisfy conservatives and freedom-loving voters across the country. Meanwhile, we’re left to simply speculate about which anti-gun, anti-life and anti-religious freedom justice Clinton would nominate. That’s a scary thought, folks, and a risk not worth taking. Like and share on Facebook and Twitter if you agree with Franklin Graham that the Supreme Court is the most important issue of this election. Which candidate do you trust more to nominate justices who respect the Constitution? Scroll down to comment below!
The Ku Klux Klan — the most notorious white supremacist group in the country — is now advertising its presence with flyers and cryptic messaging. In the 15 months since white supremacist Dylann Roof’s mass shooting at the Emanuel AME church in Charleston, South Carolina, flyers promoting the Klan (KKK) have appeared in communities across the country. The Washington Post reported that flyers were seen in California, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and other states. The flyers are often left on lawns inside plastic bags weighed down with rocks, along with various racist, Islamophobic, and anti-immigrant messages. One resident in Fishers, Indiana received a bag that included a KKK flyer along with a crudely written note bashing immigrants, minorities, and homosexuals. Ross Olsby told the Indianapolis Star he picked up approximately 200 bags on neighbors’ lawns so their children wouldn’t have to see them. “You think we made a lot of progress in the last 80 years, and I guess we have, but boy it’s 2016 and we still have work to do I guess,” Olsby said. Photo by Kaitlin Lange, Indianapolis Star The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which monitors and profiles hate groups across the US, said in their most recent “Year in Hate and Extremism” report that KKK groups have nearly tripled in size, suggesting racists have become more emboldened. In 2014, there were roughly 72 KKK affiliate groups in the US. By 2015, there were almost 200 KKK groups. 35-year-old Jaimi Hajzus, of Coudersport, Pennsylvania, said the ominous flyers started appearing in her neighborhood this past weekend. She told the Post that she’s worried Klan groups are trying to incite a race war with the incendiary flyers. “If this is actually a resurgence of a hateful and violent group, then we need to take a stance,” Hajzus said. KKK flyer, courtesy of Jaimi Hajzus for the Washington Post US Uncut’s attempts to call the “24-Hour Klanline” listed on the flyers were unsuccessful, and the mailbox associated with the number was full as of 12 PM Eastern on Wednesday afternoon.          
Go to www.iPatriot.com and Join the Citizen Journalist Revolution! The Democrats are using an intimidation tactic which they are prone to use incessantly. If you question the veracity of a black president’s birth certificate you are racist. That is the outright claim of Lynn Sweet Washington Bureau Chief for the Chicago Sun-Times made on Fox News. Consider the slanted claim that if a president is black and his birth certificate is called into question the conclusion is you must be a racist. What is wrong with this obvious non-sequitur? First of all, there is evidence the birth certificate presented was altered. This is discounted by the claims that whoever presented this must be racist. Secondly, the social security number presented of Barack Obama was issued in Connecticut where there is no record of him domiciling there. Third, the hospital that issued his birth certificate in Hawaii didn’t exist when it was “issued.” Fourth, an examination of the birth certificate produced several errors that could only be attributed to falsification. Has an unquestioned birth certificate ever been presented?  No, only a cry of racism when the request is made.  They can’t produce an original document and they then rely on the smear of “birther” and racism to substantiate that which they can produce no physical evidence of.  Sadly, Donald Trump has bowed to their… Read the rest of the story at www.iPatriot.com  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.
Liberals in the media and the political arena thought that Hillary Clinton’s victory was in the bag. The rest of the campaign was a mere formality in order for her to make the White House her residence once again. Her campaign’s plan was to lay low, out of the spotlight, make little to no contact with the press, and just let Donald Trump do all the talking and hopefully keep his foot in his mouth to draw all the media attention. But now that the post-DNC honeymoon is over, they have to come back to reality and see that the election isn’t over, and that they had grossly underestimated Donald Trump and his campaign. Add to that Hillary’s frequent, inconvenient health episodes, and now even some Democrats are talking about a “Plan B.” For the past few weeks, the poll numbers have closed in, with Donald Trump taking the lead in several key battleground states. Now, even Hillary is asking why she isn’t “50 points ahead” of Trump? At a campaign event in Las Vegas, Hillary video conferenced in to address the Labor International Union of North America. While she was talking about “investing in infrastructure, raising the minimum wage, and collective bargaining,” she raised the question: “Having said all this, ‘Why aren’t I 50 points ahead?’ you might ask? Well, the choice for working families has never been clearer. I need your help to get Donald Trump’s record out to everybody. Nobody should be fooled.” At another point in her speech, she encouraged her supporters to “stage an intervention” if they know anyone who supports Trump. “If you do know somebody who might be voting for Trump, stage an intervention,” she said. “Try to talk some sense into them. Lay out the facts. The facts are on our side, about what I’ve done versus what he’s done. Remember, friends don’t let friends vote for Trump.”  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.
Well that didn’t take long. Donald trump, who had just been beaten to a bloody pulp for 90 minutes by an opponent so far out of his league it’s preposterous, did the only thing he knows how to do: Claim he was treated unfairly: Nothing on emails. Nothing on the corrupt Clinton Foundation. And nothing on #Benghazi. #Debates2016 #debatenight — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016  Poor Donald. He looked like such a petulant little child up there. His obvious case of the sniffles aside, his lack of preparation, lack of personality, lack of ability to actually compose a coherent thought and lack of any human decency came through perfectly. No, Donald. Nobody wants to listen to right-wing conspiracy theories. Secretary Clinton covered emails. The Clinton Foundation, unlike your sham charities, actually does charitable work. Please go home, have a good cry and try again October 9th. We here at Winning Democrats would like to congratulate Secretary Clinton on not just a win but a blowout.
Sometimes when you try to be clever, it backfires… it’s always a gamble. In this case though, it was more like Hillary backfired, had all 4 tires blow, and then gets out of the car just in time to get rammed by a passing ice-cream truck… The woman made an entrance to a song that was just not the right song to pick…sorta. It probably would have been fine, except CBS totally threw her under the bus… Which…what?! Anywho…get your laugh on, check this out.  Daaaaang, someone needs to buy the person who wrote that script a drink! They provided us with some good entertainment right there. I mean… AWKWARD! That whole thing about Hillary, how ironic right? However, the dialogue between the anchors themselves and the awkward ‘it wasn’t me, it wasn’t me’ and sticking their heads up Hillary’s you know what even further… was priceless. Cowards really. So what if you read from a script, you don’t hold the thing up on air, wave it around and pass the blame over something you reported. It’s just tasteless in my opinion. She was probably freaking out, that she was going to be the next social media target for ridicule..blah blah blah. It’s sad really when you see people enslaved to that kind of fear…and when you are, that’s when you can label yourself a liberal. Everything is an issue with them, because they didn’t get told the truth often enough growing up. Hillary Clinton walked out to James Brown’s ‘I feel good’ … someone is STILL lying to her. The woman is not well… and as for feeling nice like sugar and spice? When did Satan get a spice cabinet? 
“[Ahmad Khan Rahami] should go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend.” — Rock Legend Gene Simmons commenting on recent NY/NJ bomber Ahmad Khan Rahami Hall of Fame rock legend Gene Simmons made a name for himself playing the bass guitar and singing for the pop-rock band KISS. In more recent years he’s been a reality TV star, a cultural icon, and an outspoken defender of the free market system and personal liberty. The combination of these things has made Simmons marketing gold among more conservative NASCAR loving, flag waving Americans. The folks at TMZ recently ran into Simmons in the airport security line and asked him for his thoughts on the recent bombings. Simmons told TMZ that he thought the Muslim terrorist bomber, Rahami, “should go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend.” Ouch. TMZ then asked Simmons how he would solve the problem of Islamic terrorism in America, to which Simmons replied, rather politically incorrectly, that we needed to do more profiling. “Nobody says the word ‘profile.’ Everyone needs to get smart. I’m ok with profiling. I want you to stop me first. I want you to stop me because I look a certain way. And if I’m clear, then profile someone else. It’s emergency powers during war. There’s a war going on.” But what about the people who were being “unfairly” profiled, TMZ wondered. Simmons held nothing back in his perfect response. “It is unfair. That’s why the words ‘too bad’ exists.” BOOM.  Thank you for being awesome, Mr. Simmons. Maybe when Donald Trump gets elected President he’ll consider making Gene Simmons the director of Homeland Security? Ooh, and then KISS could play at all of the White House State functions!

In a scathing interview in which he admits he will be cast by Democrats of not being a “team player,” the man who was America’s first black governor, Democrat Douglas Wilder, accused the Democrat Party of taking black voters for granted, said blacks are no better off after eight disappointing years of Obama, and that Hillary Clinton can’t win the White House running on a message that she’s the second worst person in the world (assuming Donald Trump is the first). Perhaps equally embarrassing for Hillary Clinton, Douglas Wilder praised Republican Donald Trump’s recent outreach to black voters, giving him credit for doing it even if it lacks authenticity. “The African American community has not been served,” Wilder, who was elected to be Virginia’s governor in 1989 told the Washington Post on Thursday, a reference to the Obama administration. “Don’t piss on me and tell me it’s raining!” he said, noting that Obama should “admit it” rather than telling black Americans “to quit whining when they’re asked for legitimate grievances to be addressed.” “I’m entitled to my criticism of Obama because I was one of the first people to support him,” he told The Post. In regards to Hillary Clinton, Wilder said that she needs to do more than just paint herself as not as bad as Donald Trump, but used harsh language to make his point. “Let’s assume (Trump) is the worst guy in the world. Fine. What makes you better? Because you’re not considered the worst, but right next to it!” Wilder, clearly no fan of Donald Trump’s either, said that he’s a “huckster” and is “good at it,” but nevertheless applauded his outreach to black voters. “Whether it’s genuine or legitimate or not, at least he’s doing it,” he said. “Either way, I think it’s good.” Wilder said that even after eight years of Obama, the country is still in a “mess” and that Hillary Clinton needs to be much more specific on ideas and policy positions she has to make things better and said that she has “blundered” by making the election a “referendum on Donald Trump.” “When I ran for office, I never mentioned my opponent’s name. I always said, ‘Vote for me for these reasons,” Wilder said. Douglas Wilder has always been outspoken and politically incorrect, which is refreshing. It would be interesting to see what the country would look like if he’d have been the first black president the past eight years instead of Obama.  Email Subscribe
This Thursday Ohio Republican Representative Warren Davidson reaffirmed his statement that “moochers” and “pretenders” are blocking the Veterans Affairs’ health care system. At a town hall event Monday morning in West Chester, Ohio Boehner’s successor spoke to the Concerned Veterans for America, accusing the Department of Veterans Affairs’ health care system of buckling under the weight of “moochers.” “Just like workers comp out here’s got moochers, I wish that there were no vets that were the same sort of problem on our society,” said Davidson. “But part of the problem is there are some vets that are moochers and they’re clogging up the system. And we do as taxpayers want to make sure the VA filters out these folks that are pretenders. Just like we wish there were no people out there with stolen valor, but that’s a problem in the vet community too.” In response, the GOP chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, Rep. Jeff Miller (R-FL), antagonized Davison for his reductive remarks but took it easy on him by saying, “I can only hope that Rep. Davidson misspoke, and I look forward to him clarifying his remarks.” Joe Davis, a national spokesman for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, also responded negatively to Davidson’s comments, saying “honorably discharged veterans with service-connected wounds, illnesses and injuries, or who are indigent due to circumstances beyond their control, are not moochers.” On the other side of the aisle, Democrats also seized the opportunity to reject Davidson’s remarks, calling them irresponsible and rude. Steve Fought, a Democrat in Ohio’s 8th congressional district who ran an election against Davidson, said Davidson “is the first congressman ever to blame the shortcomings of the VA health care system on the veterans themselves.” The chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, David Pepper, also jumped on the bandwagon saying, “I would like to know just how he intends to decide which veterans are worthy of health care and which ones are ‘moochers’. Perhaps the congressman is frustrated with the system, but the solution isn’t to kick veterans off the health care coverage they’ve earned through service to their country.” Davidson, however was notably unfazed and doubled down on his remarks Thursday saying, “As a veteran, I know the subpar care that many of my brothers and sisters in arms have received, and I will not be content until that is changed. Any effort to suggest I have anything other than a soldier’s passion for providing our veterans with the care they deserve is dishonest.” Despite Davidson’s conviction about “moochers” and “pretenders” in the veteran community, only one of the four cases of VA benefits fraud found and prosecuted by the inspector general involved VA health care services. Hardly enough to make a dent in the administration of VA health care services, or make sweeping generalizations about a community that has had to make the most tangible sacrifices for the well-being of the nation.
Toby Keith has been forced to cancel his show in South Carolina and it was totally unexpected. Toby Keith was scheduled to perform at the Florence Civic Center in South Carolina on September 22 and he was forced to cancel. Unfortunately the night before the concert Toby Keith sent out an update to all of his fans sharing the heartbreaking news.  The good news is that Toby Keith didn’t have to cancel his concert because he was ill or hurt. The bad news is that there are huge fuel shortages in South Carolina and the gas prices are continuing to rise in the Southeast. The General Manager of the Florence Civic Center,Kendall Wall, shared that the venue had received many messages from fans stating that they weren’t going to be able to make it because of the fuel cancern. Both Keith’s managers and the Florence Civic center decided that it was best for the fans if the concert was postponed to a later date. They wanted it to be fair for everyone who had already purchased their tickets. “This is a major show for the region which attracts fans within a one- to two-hour drive and beyond…We understand the growing concerns for Toby’s fans and our own fans, as we’ve been receiving distress messages over the past couple days…It would be unfair for these fans and unrealistic for them to travel given the current dismal situation with gas prices and availability.”  The rescheduled concert date is March 7,2017 and the tickets will be honored for that concert. If any fan is unable to make the rescheduled concert date, there will be refunds made but only for a short amount of time. Toby Keith is one of the most respected country artists and we hope that those fans who could have made the concert are understanding of the cancelation.  I’m glad that everyone is okay, but it is such a bummer that these things have to happen. Pray for South Carolina!
In 2011, St. Louis police officer Jason Stockley shot and killed Anthony Lamar Smith, a drug suspect that he was trying to arrest. At the time, Stockley claimed that he saw Smith reaching for a gun, which is why he fired his. Self-defense, thatâs all it ever is, isnât it? The problem isâ¦Smith was unarmed and now thereâs not just evidence of that, but thereâs also evidence that Stockley may have done worse than lie. There is a strong possibility that he planted the gun in Smithâs car after murdering him to cover his own ass. Smith did flee the scene of a possible drug deal and a high-speed chase ensued. Stockley was carrying a personally-owned AK-47 that Smith, in escaping, almost knocked out of his hands. Stockley was not authorized to carry that weapon while on duty, which goes a long way towards demonstrating Stockley as an unethical officer at the very least. He was also recorded as saying that he was going to kill Smith. Stockleyâs partner, Brian Bianchi, said that he warned Stockley about a revolver on the seat of Smithâs car, and Stockley himself said he feared Smith was about to pull the revolver when he approached: âBefore striking me [with his car], I observed, in plain view in the subjectâs hand while resting on the passenger seat, a silver handgun. The handgun was pointing up and towards meâ¦ Because of the presence of a weapon and because I felt my personal safety was in jeopardy, as was the safety of P.O. Bianchi, and bystanders, I fired several shots at the subject.â Itâs apparently hard to see in the videos whether Stockley handled the revolver; however, itâs damned telling that only his DNA was on the gun. Something of Smith would definitely have been there if heâd been handling the gun, as Stockley alleged. The St. Louis Board of Police Commissioners did pay a $900,000 settlement to Smithâs family in 2013, but Stockley himself was not charged with murder. That is, until this year, when this new evidence came to light. Stockley is now charged with first-degree murder, but is free on a $1 million bond. He left the St. Louis Police Department in 2013. Watch below for more background on this story:  
Here’s the thing: one does not have to love America. This is a free country and if one feels the need to disrespect this nation, there are not – nor should there be – legal consequences.   However, let’s be very clear: there is no law that mandates that people should be able to say whatever they want, whenever they want and remain free from encountering consequences. If I told my boss to shove it, it would be wrong for me to end up in jail for the supposed crime. However, is it not fair that I should be fired or otherwise demoted or reprimanded? Similarly, the NFL has the authority to punish the ingrates who refuse to stand for the national anthem. They have chosen not to and thus, many are choosing to boycott the NFL, including this author. Others are making consequences clear: as several Miami Dolphin players continue to demonstrate their hatred for the country that affords them the opportunity to make millions upon millions of dollars doing what they love, a police union in Miami has weighed in and asked Sheriff deputies to not perform security details for the players anymore until such a time that they begin to show a little gratitude towards this nation. Jeffery Bell, the president of the International Union of Police Associations, Local 6020, said: “We’ve asked the deputies and the Broward Sheriff’s Office not to do the details anymore.” The union has asked police units to stop providing protection for the players at a time when fans and former fans have begun to vent their outrage towards the players. Some have even taken to burning Dolphins gear. “I respect their right to have freedom of speech. However, in certain organizations and certain jobs you give up that right of your freedom of speech temporary while you serve that job or while you play in an NFL game,” Bell said. If these ingrates are so convinced that blacks are being persecuted by police – a central premise in the platform of Black Lives Matter – then they should not receive the benefit that these supposed bigots afford. 
Good luck getting through this video without wanting to punch your screen. This guy is a wreck. He was pulled over for a traffic violation, and from the get go was the most obnoxious, immature, race-baiting buttface you have probably heard in a very long time. I have got to hand it to the Police Officer, this is the kind of garbage they have to deal with now ALL THE TIME… even soccer moms are being absolute terrors to Police Officers when they get pulled over now. What used to be a every now and then difficulty has become a daily thing for these Police Officers to have to deal with. All the sudden with Obama’s America everyone feels entitled, and have learned a few big words that they like to use when Police pull them over…to try and what? Make the police hesitate because of all the BLM garbage going on? Make them feel like they can break the law and not have to answer to Police if they are a minority? Can you imagine how patient the Police have to be now? NO ONE and I repeat NO HUMAN being could possibly be as patient through this kind of treatment day and day out everyday. I dare anyone to try who thinks they can without going off eventually. What’s worse about this guy…is as soon as he got pulled over he popped out his phone and had no problem live streaming the whole thing. Then as he’s being all self-righteous and using his big words to call on a supervisor…he hides drugs. Yes.. HIDES DRUGS! He is shouting up and down that he’s being treated unfairly, and he’s done nothing wrong….then on LIVE video…hides his drugs, while Police are at their vehicles.. How did so many Americans get so stupid in just 8 years? It’s embarrassing… I mean after what this guy did…I wouldn’t be surprised if the IQ of the entire world just dropped a 100 points. Watch…I’m sure you’ll feel the same afterwards.  Now you can go to jail man…and it’s all your own fault.
